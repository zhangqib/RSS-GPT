<div> distillation, language generation, DiDi-Instruct, dLLMs, GPT-2 

Summary:
The paper introduces DiDi-Instruct, a training-based method for fast and high-quality language generation. It utilizes a pre-trained discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) to distill a student model for accelerated generation, achieving comparable or superior performance to its teacher and GPT-2 with up to 64x acceleration. The method is based on integral KL-divergence minimization and includes improvements such as grouped reward normalization and reward-guided ancestral sampler. DiDi-Instruct outperforms prior accelerated dLLMs and GPT-2 on OpenWebText dataset, with perplexity ranging from 62.2 to 18.4. The method requires minimal additional training time and has negligible entropy loss. Extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences validate its robustness and effectiveness. DiDi-Instruct is an efficient distillation method enabling fast language generation. The code and models will be released on GitHub for further exploration and use.

Abstract: Fast and high-quality language generation is the holy grail that people pursue in the age of AI. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that initializes from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM) and distills a few-step student for fast generation. The resulting DiDi-Instruct model achieves comparable or superior performance to its dLLM teacher and the GPT-2 baseline while enabling up to 64$\times$ acceleration. The theoretical foundation of DiDi-Instruct is a novel framework based on integral KL-divergence minimization, which yields a practical training algorithm. We further introduce grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler that significantly improve training stability, model coverage, and inference quality. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct achieves perplexity from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs), which outperforms prior accelerated dLLMs and GPT-2 baseline. These gains come with a negligible entropy loss (around $1\%$) and reduce additional training wall-clock time by more than $20\times$ compared to competing dLLM distillation methods. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

<div> Methodology, Evaluation, Semantic coverage, Test questions, RAG

Summary:
The paper introduces a new methodology for quantifying the semantic coverage of test questions in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing evaluation frameworks for language model-powered applications often lack systematic methods to ensure test sets cover the underlying knowledge base comprehensively. The proposed methodology utilizes vector embeddings and clustering algorithms to assess the coverage of test questions against their corresponding documents. Metrics such as basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question coverage are calculated to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the test set. Additionally, outlier detection is employed to filter irrelevant questions and refine the test sets. Experimental results from two use cases demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in identifying content areas with inadequate representation and providing recommendations for generating new, high-value test questions. This methodology equips RAG developers with essential tools to enhance the reliability of their systems and extend their applications to tasks like identifying misaligned documents.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new, high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Summary: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are crucial for various molecular simulations. Current models enforce symmetries through equivariant neural networks, limiting flexibility and scalability. The TransIP model introduces a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials, achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Trained on the Open Molecules (OMol25) dataset, TransIP performs comparably to state-of-the-art models. It outperforms a data augmentation baseline, showing 40% to 60% performance improvement across different dataset sizes. This work demonstrates the efficacy of learned equivariance as an efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

<div> Keywords: RoPE, post-training quantization, long-context dependencies, interpolation, outlier shifting

Summary: 
RoPE-based interpolation methods have been used to extend the context window support of large language models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. However, combining RoPE position interpolation with post-training quantization can lead to accuracy degradation due to various coupled effects. The authors conducted a systematic analysis of this approach and introduced two diagnostics: interpolation pressure and tail-inflation ratios to address the issues. They proposed Q-ROAR, a weight-only interpolation-aware stabilization method for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights. Empirical results show that Q-ROAR reduces model perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14% while maintaining short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks. This approach does not require fine-tuning, architecture or kernel changes, or additional deployment overhead.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes, enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization, RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system stacks.

- DexBench is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in managing diabetes.<br />
- The benchmark includes 7 task categories covering real-world decision-making scenarios faced by individuals with diabetes.<br />
- A dataset of one month of time-series data from 15,000 individuals across different diabetes populations is compiled for evaluation.<br />
- Model performance is assessed on 360,600 personalized questions using 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity, and actionability.<br />
- Analysis of 8 recent LLMs shows variability in performance across tasks and metrics, with no single model consistently outperforming others.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g., eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized, contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care.

<div> hierarchical data, p-adic metric spaces, machine learning, natural language processing, interpolation

Summary: 
The article presents a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which better capture the hierarchical structure of data compared to traditional Euclidean metrics. It proves that in p-adic spaces, a plane minimizing the sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 points, showcasing the alignment with hierarchical relationships. It also shows that a polynomial constructed to minimize the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points. Additionally, interpolating between points in hierarchical data is less meaningful than selecting actual observed points as representatives. Practical applications in natural language processing, such as analyzing taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology, demonstrate the significance of these results. The study suggests that p-adic metrics play a crucial role in effectively handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that utilizes pre-trained large language models to address the heterogeneity of tabular data in federated learning settings. Tabular records are converted into text and embeddings from models like DistilBERT and RoBERTa are used as universal feature extractors. This approach eliminates the need for manual schema harmonization and preserves privacy by keeping raw data local. FedLLM-Align outperforms existing methods in coronary heart disease prediction tasks, achieving improved F1-scores and reducing communication costs. It shows resilience to extreme schema divergence, unlike traditional methods that fail under such conditions. FedLLM-Align is a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge, we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments.

Summary: 
This survey discusses the intersection of foundation models (FMs) and AI agents in the context of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. It highlights the shift towards autonomous, generalizing agents powered by FMs and the challenges posed by resource limitations in deployment environments. The survey identifies techniques such as elastic inference, test-time adaptation, and dynamic multimodal integration as key to balancing accuracy, latency, and communication trade-offs. It also outlines open challenges in sustaining robustness under distribution shifts and emphasizes the importance of algorithm-system co-design and cognitive adaptation in addressing these challenges. The survey offers a unified perspective on scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI, aiming to advance discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents. <div>
arXiv:2510.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.

<div> ordinal regression, unimodal likelihood models, approximate unimodal likelihood models, ordinal data, statistical modeling
Summary: 
Ordinal regression, also known as ordinal classification, involves the classification of ordinal data where the target variable has a natural ordinal relation to the explanatory variable. Many real-world ordinal data exhibit a tendency for the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given the explanatory variable to be unimodal. While previous studies have focused on unimodal likelihood models, which guarantee a unimodal predicted CPD, these models may exhibit bias for non-unimodal CPDs. To address this issue, this study proposes approximately unimodal likelihood models that can represent both unimodal and close-to-unimodal CPDs. Experimental results show that the proposed models are effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and ordinal regression tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure, cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization; Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures. Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates 100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction, and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational model.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based spiking neural network (SNN) models to address the computational challenges of existing transformer architectures. NeurTransformer replaces the self-attention mechanism with spike-based self-attention and fine-tunes the SNN model using surrogate learning algorithms. The methodology is benchmarked using GPT-2 models, showing a loss in cosine similarity and reduction in perplexity. Additionally, energy efficiency is highlighted, with significant reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the spike-based self-attention mechanism on digital hardware. NeurTransformer presents a scalable approach to leveraging SNNs for transformer models, offering accuracy and efficiency benefits for tasks such as general language modeling and scientific applications like material science and climate research. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

<div> cognitive mechanism, concept learning, identifiability, diversity, nonparametric<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of the cognitive mechanism of comparison in human learning and its relevance to machines in recovering true concepts from data. It argues that comparison is essential for ensuring correctness in concept learning for machines. The theoretical framework developed in the study focuses on the identifiability of concepts using multiple classes of observations. The research shows that with diverse observations, hidden concepts can be identified without the need for specific assumptions or generative models. Even in cases where global conditions are not met, the theory can still provide guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons. The nonparametric identification of hidden structures between classes and concepts is also explored. The theoretical findings are validated through experiments in both synthetic and real-world settings. <div>

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison, fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden structure between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and real-world settings.

<div> reinforcement learning, limited feedback, reward selection, policy performance, scaling<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from limited feedback (RLLF), where only a fraction of samples receive labeled rewards. The study explores two types of reward selection strategies: heuristic-based methods using reward-free information and strategies pre-trained with auxiliary evaluative feedback. It is found that selecting critical subsets of rewards that guide the agent along optimal trajectories and support recovery toward near-optimal behavior is crucial for achieving near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels. Effective reward selection methods are shown to be powerful in scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings. <div>

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback -- only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii) strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings.

<div> fairness, algorithmic decision-making, counterfactual measures, partial identification, Bayesian approach

Summary:
The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating counterfactual fairness measures in AI decision-making systems by using partial identification to derive informative bounds from observational data. A Bayesian approach is introduced to bound unknown fairness measures with high confidence. The study focuses on the COMPAS dataset, analyzing fairness in recidivism risk scores concerning race, age, and sex. Results indicate a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS score when changing race to African-American and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age. The research sheds light on the complexities of evaluating algorithmic fairness and provides a method to derive meaningful bounds from available data. <div>

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race, age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

<title>Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls</title>

<div> Keywords: Language models, multi-digit multiplication, attention mechanism, long-range dependencies, inductive bias

Summary: 
Language models struggle with multi-digit multiplication due to a lack of long-range dependencies. By studying a successful model, three key findings emerged: 1) Evidence of long-range structure enables the model to encode necessary dependencies. 2) The model utilizes an attention mechanism to create a directed acyclic graph for storing and recalling partial products. 3) The model represents digits using a Fourier basis and Minkowski sums in attention heads, providing efficient representations lacking in standard fine-tuning models. Additionally, understanding the learning dynamics of fine-tuning reveals a lack of necessary dependencies. Introducing an auxiliary loss for predicting the "running sum" through linear regression aids the model in learning multi-digit multiplication successfully. This study highlights the challenge of learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and the importance of incorporating the correct inductive bias to address this issue. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via \emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve'' pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe, which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the correct inductive bias can address this issue.

<div> PrunedLoRA; structured pruning; low-rank adaptation; parameter-efficient fine-tuning; large language models

Summary:
PrunedLoRA is introduced as a framework for obtaining expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized initializations by leveraging structured pruning. Unlike traditional approaches, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, allowing for flexible and adaptive rank allocation. Through gradient-based pruning focused on minimizing pruning error for overall loss, PrunedLoRA offers fine-grained pruning and recovery updates with a solid theoretical basis. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the robustness of structured pruning, showing gradient-based pruning to be more resilient to weight perturbation compared to activation-based techniques. Empirically, PrunedLoRA outperforms existing methods, including LoRA and its variants, across various supervised fine-tuning tasks, showcasing its efficacy in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding while demonstrating advantages at diverse sparsity levels over other structured pruning methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation, enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding, and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods across diverse sparsity levels.

Summary:
The research introduces GRPO-$\lambda$, an extension to GRPO that improves credit assignment for large language models (LLMs) in reinforcement learning finetuning for complex reasoning tasks. The approach approximates learning from $\lambda$-return using token-level log-probabilities and a critic-free approximation of temporal-difference error. Various weighting variations for $\lambda$-return are explored, all of which show significant performance gains over GRPO. Testing on math reasoning datasets with LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters demonstrates 30-40% improved performance during RL training on different model architectures. Results show that GRPO-$\lambda$ outperforms GRPO, with an average improvement of over 3 points on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC datasets, with a notable 4.5-point improvement on the 7B model. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on $4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40% improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios; hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1. We will make our platform open to the public soon.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models, LoRAFusion, Efficient Fine-Tuning System

Summary:
LoRAFusion introduces an efficient fine-tuning system for Large Language Models (LLMs) called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that addresses inefficiencies in existing systems. It tackles runtime overhead and missed opportunities by proposing a graph-splitting method at the kernel level to fuse memory-bound operations, eliminating unnecessary memory accesses. Additionally, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning, splitting LoRA adapters into groups and solving bin-packing problems to generate balanced microbatches. The system achieves significant speedup compared to Megatron-LM and mLoRA, with improved end-to-end performance and kernel performance. The fused kernel can be seamlessly integrated into existing LoRA systems. LoRAFusion is open-source and available on GitHub for wider adoption and further development. <br /><br />Summary: LoRAFusion enhances LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs by addressing runtime overhead and missed opportunities through efficient kernel-level operations and an innovative adaptive batching algorithm, resulting in significant performance improvements compared to existing systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second, they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Summary:
Directed-MAML is introduced as a task-directed meta-RL algorithm to address challenges faced by traditional MAML in meta-RL settings. It utilizes a first-order task-directed approximation before second-order gradient computations to enhance convergence and reduce computational burden. Experimental results demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and convergence speed of Directed-MAML compared to MAML-based approaches in various scenarios. The integration of task-directed approximation in other meta-learning algorithms like FOMAML and Meta-SGD also leads to improved computational efficiency and convergence speed. <div>
arXiv:2510.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations, leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm. Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence speed.

<div> Keywords: transformers, parallel adaptive computation, latent space, pretraining, language modeling

Summary:
Thoughtbubbles introduces a new transformer variant that enables parallel adaptive computation in latent space. This approach allows tokens requiring significant computation to create "bubbles" of cloned residuals within the network for additional processing. Importantly, this behavior is learned during pretraining using only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles demonstrates superior performance compared to standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation methods on various evaluation tasks, including OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity. It also excels in zero-shot evaluations like HellaSwag and LAMBADA across different parameter scales ranging from 150M to 772M. The implicit nature of Thoughtbubbles' method enables adaptive computation to be integrated into the learning process from pretraining onwards, potentially unifying training and testing behaviors for reasoning models. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated, natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Summary:  
KV cache compression offers increased throughput and efficiency with minimal performance loss. However, the impact of compression on realistic scenarios like multi-instruction prompting needs more study. Certain instructions may degrade rapidly with compression, leading to their exclusion from the LLM. System prompt leakage is affected by compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias. Changes to KV cache eviction policies can mitigate these effects and enhance performance in multi-instruction tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Summary: 
The paper introduces DIANO, a framework that uses neural networks to create physically interpretable latent spaces for dimensionality and geometric reduction of high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data. DIANO compresses input functions into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstructs them using encoding and decoding neural operators. It incorporates a fully differentiable partial differential equation solver within the latent space to enforce physical priors and enable temporal advancement of high- and low-fidelity PDEs. The framework is evaluated against baseline models such as Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders on benchmark problems like flow past a 2D cylinder and a patient-specific 3D coronary artery. The results demonstrate DIANO's effectiveness in solving PDEs in a latent space while achieving dimensional and geometrical reduction and maintaining interpretability. <div>
arXiv:2510.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent interpretability.

Summary:
This article explores the use of per-example gradient statistics in deep learning training algorithms. It demonstrates that computing additional statistics beyond the average gradient in mini-batch processing can be implemented efficiently through automatic differentiation graph surgery. The study highlights the significance of per-example gradient transformations in optimizing nonlinear operations, such as signSGD and Adam preconditioner. It reveals that the optimal placement of the sign operation and the dominance of the mean over the variance in the gradient distribution play crucial roles in successful optimization. Moreover, the article showcases that JAX's vectorization transformation is suitable for prototyping and experimenting with certain classes of models, including transformers. Overall, the research sheds light on new possibilities for algorithm design by leveraging per-example gradient information in deep learning training processes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation (AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

<div> Keywords: supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, prompt diversity, chain-of-thought supervision, generalization

Summary:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been thought to memorize training data and lack generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). However, a study on decision-making benchmarks Sokoban and General Points challenges this belief. The perceived failure of SFT is attributed to frozen-prompt artifacts, where models stick to fixed instruction templates. By introducing prompt diversity during training, SFT models show strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without sacrificing performance on known tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision aids in transferring to more challenging tasks, such as larger Sokoban grids and complex arithmetic problems, enhancing SFT's ability to generalize. Combining prompt diversity with CoT leads to robust generalization across instruction-variant and difficulty-variant scenarios, matching or surpassing RL baselines while retaining the simplicity and stability of SFT.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones. Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability. These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

Summary: <br />Microscopy techniques generate large amounts of complex image data that can be simplified using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to reveal underlying physical structures. The performance of VAEs relies on specific design choices, which are typically optimized through trial and error. This study focuses on reward-based strategies for evaluating latent space representations in VAE workflows using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data as a model system. By approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM), efficient reward functions can be constructed to guide the search for optimal representations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of GMM and BGMM in estimating model efficiency and facilitating automated optimization of VAE workflows. <div>

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Summary:
- The study focuses on length generalization in sequence models combining state tracking and associative recall.
- Recurrent networks excel at state tracking but struggle with recall, while Transformers are strong at recall but weaker in state tracking on longer sequences.
- Hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components were constructed to leverage the strengths of both architectures.
- The study found that the Transformer component in the hybrids tends to rely on shortcut solutions, hindering length generalization performance.
- A training strategy of delaying the training of attention layers was proposed, which significantly improved length generalization performance, allowing the hybrid models to achieve high accuracy (>90%) on sequences three times longer than those used in training.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy ($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during training.

<div> Energy-based model, Variational Auto-Encoders, prior hole problem, sampler network, image generation quality<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces an Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to address the "prior hole" problem in Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By modeling the prior as an energy-based model (EBM) and utilizing a variational approach to tackle the normalization constant, the method can generate high-quality images with reduced prior holes and improved sampling efficiency. The proposed EVaLP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in image generation tasks. This approach offers flexibility to match posteriors while maintaining fast sample generation. By formulating training priors as an alternating optimization problem and utilizing a sampler network, the EVaLP method provides an efficient and effective solution to the blurry and inconsistent sample generation issues commonly associated with VAEs. <div>
arXiv:2510.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation, high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches. The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency.

Summary:
SLogic is a novel framework for knowledge graph completion that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules, addressing the limitation of fixed confidence scores in existing approaches. It utilizes a scoring function that considers the subgraph centered on a query's head entity to assess the significance of each rule dynamically. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including embedding-based and rule-based methods, by leveraging local subgraph context. This approach offers an interpretable way to capture compositional relationships in knowledge graphs while adapting rule importance based on query-specific context. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, SLogic demonstrates consistent performance improvement, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing knowledge graph completion tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity, allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Large Language Models, bidirectional attention mechanism, KV Cache, parallel decoding algorithms, Free Draft-and-Verification

Summary: 
Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) utilize bidirectional attention to capture context connections, overcoming challenges like the "reversal curse." However, DLLMs face inference efficiency issues due to their bidirectional nature's incompatibility with KV Cache. Existing parallel decoding algorithms sacrifice performance for speed. To address this, the novel Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave) algorithm ensures lossless parallel decoding for DLLMs. By combining parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, Freedave achieves a 2.8x throughput increase without performance degradation in math reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However, this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math reasoning tasks.

Summary: 
ACT-ViT is introduced as a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages the sequential structure of activation data in LLMs and treats activation tensors like images. The model, inspired by Vision Transformers, outperforms traditional probing techniques by efficiently analyzing activation tensors from multiple LLMs. By training on data from various LLMs, ACT-ViT achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets and can be effectively fine-tuned for new LLMs. The architecture is demonstrated to be highly efficient for deployment and is available for use with code provided on GitHub. This innovative approach enhances the safety of deploying LLM-generated text by improving the detection of hallucinations in a diverse range of LLM models and datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Summary: This study investigates the loss of plasticity (LoP) phenomenon in deep learning models operating in non-stationary environments. LoP refers to a decrease in the models' ability to learn over time. The research identifies two main causes of LoP: frozen units due to activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy. Interestingly, features that enhance generalization in static settings can contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios. The study validates its findings through numerical simulations and suggests potential strategies for mitigation, such as architectural adjustments or targeted perturbations. The results of this work provide a foundational understanding of LoP in gradient-based learning systems, shedding light on the challenges posed by non-stationary data environments. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios. We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation strategies.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Lipschitz bandit problem with stochastic delayed feedback, where rewards are observed after a random delay. For bounded delays, a delay-aware zooming algorithm is proposed, maintaining optimal performance with a term scaling with the maximal delay. In the case of unbounded delays, a phased learning strategy accumulates feedback over scheduled intervals, almost optimally up to logarithmic factors based on a regret lower bound. Experimental results showcase the efficiency of the algorithms across different delay scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay $\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals, and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated inference methods such as one-shot federated learning and edge ensembles have shown promise in combining predictions from multiple models. However, the robustness of these methods has been largely overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. This study addresses the issue by formalizing the problem of robust federated inference and conducting a comprehensive analysis. The research reveals that the accuracy of averaging-based aggregators is influenced by the dissimilarity between honest responses and the margin between the most probable classes. Moreover, non-linear aggregators pose a challenge in ensuring robustness, leading to the formulation of an adversarial machine learning problem. A novel approach involving the DeepSet aggregation model is introduced to enhance the robustness of non-linear aggregators through a combination of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation. This approach outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements across various benchmark datasets. <div>
arXiv:2510.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging, we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

<br />
Summary: DiSC-AMC is a token- and parameter-efficient variant of Large Language Models for Automatic Modulation Classification. It discretizes higher-order statistics into compact tokens, prunes exemplar lists using a neural prefilter, filters low-impact features, and enforces label-only predictions through a prompt template. These changes reduce input/output tokens and model parameters by over half while maintaining competitive accuracy. In tests with ten modulation types under noise, a baseline model achieves 5.2% accuracy, while DiSC-AMC using a smaller model achieves 45.5% accuracy. This demonstrates that careful discretization and context selection can significantly reduce inference cost while enabling practical in-the-loop deployment of prompt-based AMC. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token- and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen} baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately 5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains 45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, DecepChain, backdoor attack, reasoning, human trust

Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities, relying on chain-of-thoughts (CoT) similar to humans. However, a new risk called DecepChain has emerged, where attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent reasoning that appears legitimate. This backdoor attack leverages LLMs' own hallucinations and fine-tunes them on naturally erroneous rollouts to produce misleading conclusions. By using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with flipped rewards and a plausibility regularizer, DecepChain achieves high success rates with minimal impact on benign scenarios. Human evaluation struggles to differentiate manipulated reasoning from authentic ones, highlighting the stealthiness of this attack. If left unresolved, DecepChain could undermine human trust in LLM reasoning, necessitating urgent research to address this alarming risk. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

Summary: 
This research explores the training of transformers without skip connections, a challenging task due to their destabilizing effect on optimization. By analyzing the Jacobian of skipless transformer blocks, the study reveals the importance of skip connections for stabilization and the disruption they cause to hierarchical representations. Through a novel initialization strategy, the researchers introduce a method to efficiently train skipless transformers, specifically Vision Transformers (ViTs). The results show that skipless ViTs trained with this approach can overcome optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform baseline models with skip connections on dense prediction tasks. This suggests that skip connections are not essential for training ViTs and offers new possibilities for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

While skips stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture. We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new approach, in-context curiosity, to enhance the generalization ability of Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs) in decision-making tasks. The proposed Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) framework integrates an auxiliary reward predictor to leverage prediction errors as intrinsic curiosity signals during training. Experiments on Gaussian multi-armed bandits demonstrate that PPT improves robustness and mitigates performance degradation in scenarios with higher variance in rewards, particularly when the pretraining data lacks diversity. While the quality of offline data remains crucial, the preliminary findings suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining can effectively enhance the out-of-distribution generalization of in-context RL agents. <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity. While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

Summary:<br />
Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are more challenging to solve than standard MDPs as there is no universally optimal policy applicable to all initial state distributions. This study examines how the optimal value of CMDPs changes with different initial distributions, establishing bounds on these variations through duality analysis and perturbation analysis in linear programming. The bounds provide insight into how a policy may incur regret from unknown fluctuations in the initial distribution, enhancing understanding of policy performance under varying conditions. The research highlights the complexity of CMDPs and offers analytical tools for evaluating policy robustness in the face of changing initial distributions. <div>
arXiv:2510.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the initial distribution.

<div> Flow-based tokenizer, protein structure, multimodal models, Kanzi, autoencoder

Summary:
Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer designed for the tokenization and generation of protein structures. It simplifies protein structure tokenizers by using a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. This approach eliminates the need for frame-based representations, complex losses, and SE(3)-invariant operations, making the training process more stable. Models trained with Kanzi outperform existing tokenizers in reconstruction metrics while using fewer parameters and training resources. An autoregressive model utilizing Kanzi performs better than similar token-based generative models but falls short of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models. The availability of code on GitHub allows for further exploration and application of Kanzi in protein structure analysis. The development of Kanzi represents a significant step towards efficient and effective tokenization in protein structure modeling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures. Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention. We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

Summary:
The article introduces AReUReDi, a discrete optimization algorithm that guarantees convergence to the Pareto front when designing sequences with multiple competing objectives in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling towards Pareto-optimal states while maintaining distributional invariance. By applying AReUReDi to peptide and SMILES sequence design with up to five therapeutic properties, including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling, the algorithm outperforms evolutionary and diffusion-based approaches. These results establish AReUReDi as an effective framework for generating multi-property biomolecules through sequence optimization. <div>

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a query-only attention mechanism for continual learning, which helps mitigate loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting in scenarios with distributional shift across tasks. The mechanism simplifies transformer architectures by discarding keys and values while preserving core inductive biases. The study establishes a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and model agnostic meta-learning, viewing them as instances of meta-learning. Intuition is provided on how query-based models and attention networks can retain plasticity in continual learning settings. Preliminary analysis of the Hessian spectrum reveals that models maintaining a higher curvature rank across tasks tend to maintain plasticity. The findings suggest that full attention may not be necessary to capture the benefits of meta-learning in continual learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting, outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in continual learning.

<div> Keywords: Large Language models, symbolic control policies, program synthesis, numerical optimization, control tasks

Summary: 
Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating symbolic control policies that resemble program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models lack the ability to differentiate the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it uses, leading to inefficiencies in the search process. To address this limitation, a hybrid approach is proposed that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by incorporating an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. This method involves extracting and optimizing the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs to enhance task performance. Through the integration of symbolic program synthesis and numerical optimization, the approach achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. By combining interpretability with high performance, it bridges the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language, called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations. Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional, staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task. Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K) rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population, we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3. Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for accurate fitting of the full model.

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g., Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework -- Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving both training and inference efficiency.

Furthermore, our approach enables learning of distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to a variety of density estimation benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process: $(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases, our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials. These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference with DALEs optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more efficient cognitive assessments.

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval, where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED) are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region (G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e., graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference. Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph similarity.

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments.

<title>Hierarchy-Aware Neural Subgraph Matching with Enhanced Similarity Measure</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00402</link>

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions. Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency, offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

<title>AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404</link>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity, preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g., male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the $\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations. Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to outperform SAEs.

<title>Learning a Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning LLMs</title>

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable. Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations, thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/ZO_Fine_tuner.git.

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at https://github.com/vuno/contextualized-srrg.

<title>Plug-and-Play Prompt Refinement via Latent Feedback for Diffusion Model Alignment</title>

arXiv:2510.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory, thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement. Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

<title>On-the-Fly Data Augmentation via Gradient-Guided and Sample-Aware Influence Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00434</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window. Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning. Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the method's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations, enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems, where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical, as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this, we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes -- vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies. Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

<title>TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}. Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

arXiv:2510.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic, the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small models.

<title>Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning. Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD), and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting rather than a helpful shortcut.

arXiv:2510.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

arXiv:2510.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor, and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al. (2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations, using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1, suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step, we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore, depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

<title>Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors. This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR), Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based policymaking in global health contexts.

<title>On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

<title>Memory Determines Learning Direction: A Theory of Gradient-Based Optimization in State Space Models</title>

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization strategy.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

<title>Private Online Learning against an Adaptive Adversary: Realizable and Agnostic Settings</title>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021] established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$ against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online learnable in the agnostic setting.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the forecast quality.

<title>Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport</title>

arXiv:2510.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set, demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport. We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated, our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly, we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster shrinkage with dimension-free order.

<title>Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits</title>

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

<title>FAME: Adaptive Functional Attention with Expert Routing for Function-on-Function Regression</title>

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging. Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles (LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$ communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically, TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench, especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm, where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet, standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

<title>Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.

<title>In-Place Feedback: A New Paradigm for Guiding LLMs in Multi-Turn Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2510.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition, artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds. To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $ \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$. Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

<title>MG2FlowNet: Accelerating High-Reward Sample Generation via Enhanced MCTS and Greediness Control</title>

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at https://github.com/ZRNB/MG2FlowNet.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution, we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve image-prompt alignment.

<title>Stabilizing Policy Gradients for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention (rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.

<title>Mechanistic Interpretability as Statistical Estimation: A Variance Analysis of EAP-IG</title>

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings. In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method: EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself. Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis capabilities.

<title>The data-quality illusion: Rethinking Classifier-based quality filtering for LLM Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

arXiv:2510.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i) *structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data, enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene expression data analysis

<title>RiskPO: Risk-based Policy Optimization via Verifiable Reward for LLM Post-Training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however, prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically, RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP (Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override their reasoning.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success, we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time by over 70%.

While consistency models have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM), which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori, spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$, with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score $|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

<title>Meaningless Tokens, Meaningful Gains: How Activation Shifts Enhance LLM Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01032</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones. Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module (ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward, implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement. Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates. Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and \textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally, CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

<title>Gated X-TFC: Soft Domain Decomposition for Forward and Inverse Problems in Sharp-Gradient PDEs</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function (RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D) convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast, uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female, while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting, white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics, and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision 0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features, including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems. The source code can be found at https://github.com/AndyWu101/MAMC.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training, provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the central server that weights local model updates according to their significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models (LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards. Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary. COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification accuracy.

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length, token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier, e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency. Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts. Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL.

<title>TabINR: An Implicit Neural Representation Framework for Tabular Data Imputation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01136</link>

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution, we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs, we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN, ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising privacy guarantees.

arXiv:2510.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method, establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with provable optimality.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory prediction.

<title>Prosperity before Collapse: How Far Can Off-Policy RL Reach with Stale Data on LLMs?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance.

arXiv:2510.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory. Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with: verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other, resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM) training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment} by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead $\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and (iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and enabling flexible inference time user control.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

arXiv:2510.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration. We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

arXiv:2510.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.

<title>BroRL: Scaling Reinforcement Learning via Broadened Exploration</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance. Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

arXiv:2510.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a `local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks -- image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter distribution.

<title>Dirichlet-Prior Shaping: Guiding Expert Specialization in Upcycled MoEs</title>

arXiv:2510.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence, weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models (with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Abstract: Research on audio generation has progressively shifted from waveform-based approaches to spectrogram-based methods, which more naturally capture harmonic and temporal structures. At the same time, advances in image synthesis have shown that autoregression across scales, rather than tokens, improves coherence and detail. Building on these ideas, we introduce MARS (Multi-channel AutoRegression on Spectrograms), a framework that treats spectrograms as multi-channel images and employs channel multiplexing (CMX), a reshaping technique that lowers height and width without discarding information. A shared tokenizer provides consistent discrete representations across scales, enabling a transformer-based autoregressor to refine spectrograms from coarse to fine resolutions efficiently. Experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that MARS performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, establishing an efficient and scalable paradigm for high-fidelity audio generation.

Abstract: Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and 91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a serious sleep-related breathing disorder that is common and can impact health if left untreated. Currently the traditional method for screening and diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography is expensive and takes a lot of time, and is not practical for screening large groups of people. In this paper, we explored a more accessible option, using respiratory audio recordings to spot signs of apnea.We utilized 18 audio files.The approach involved converting breathing sounds into spectrograms, balancing the dataset by oversampling apnea segments, and applying class weights to reduce bias toward the majority class. The model reached a recall of 90.55 for apnea detection. Intentionally, prioritizing catching apnea events over general accuracy. Despite low precision,the high recall suggests potential as a low-cost screening tool that could be used at home or in basic clinical setups, potentially helping identify at-risk individuals much earlier.

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a ``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities, and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/miniHui/Geo-R1.

<title>Identifying All {\epsilon}-Best Arms in (Misspecified) Linear Bandits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to efficiently identify multiple candidates in high trial-and-error cost tasks such as drug discovery, we propose a near-optimal algorithm to identify all {\epsilon}-best arms (i.e., those at most {\epsilon} worse than the optimum). Specifically, we introduce LinFACT, an algorithm designed to optimize the identification of all {\epsilon}-best arms in linear bandits. We establish a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of this problem and demonstrate that LinFACT achieves instance optimality by matching this lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. A key ingredient of our proof is to integrate the lower bound directly into the scaling process for upper bound derivation, determining the termination round and thus the sample complexity. We also extend our analysis to settings with model misspecification and generalized linear models. Numerical experiments, including synthetic and real drug discovery data, demonstrate that LinFACT identifies more promising candidates with reduced sample complexity, offering significant computational efficiency and accelerating early-stage exploratory experiments.

<title>Private Learning of Littlestone Classes, Revisited</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00076</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider online and PAC learning of Littlestone classes subject to the constraint of approximate differential privacy. Our main result is a private learner to online-learn a Littlestone class with a mistake bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{9.5}\cdot \log(T))$ in the realizable case, where $d$ denotes the Littlestone dimension and $T$ the time horizon. This is a doubly-exponential improvement over the state-of-the-art [GL'21] and comes polynomially close to the lower bound for this task.
  The advancement is made possible by a couple of ingredients. The first is a clean and refined interpretation of the ``irreducibility'' technique from the state-of-the-art private PAC-learner for Littlestone classes [GGKM'21]. Our new perspective also allows us to improve the PAC-learner of [GGKM'21] and give a sample complexity upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{d^5 \log(1/\delta\beta)}{\varepsilon \alpha})$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote the accuracy and confidence of the PAC learner, respectively. This improves over [GGKM'21] by factors of $\frac{d}{\alpha}$ and attains an optimal dependence on $\alpha$.
  Our algorithm uses a private sparse selection algorithm to \emph{sample} from a pool of strongly input-dependent candidates. However, unlike most previous uses of sparse selection algorithms, where one only cares about the utility of output, our algorithm requires understanding and manipulating the actual distribution from which an output is drawn. In the proof, we use a sparse version of the Exponential Mechanism from [GKM'21] which behaves nicely under our framework and is amenable to a very easy utility proof.

<title>Directed Information $\gamma$-covering: An Information-Theoretic Framework for Context Engineering</title>

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Directed Information $\gamma$-covering}, a simple but general framework for redundancy-aware context engineering. Directed information (DI), a causal analogue of mutual information, measures asymmetric predictiveness between chunks. If $\operatorname{DI}_{i \to j} \ge H(C_j) - \gamma$, then $C_i$ suffices to represent $C_j$ up to $\gamma$ bits. Building on this criterion, we formulate context selection as a $\gamma$-cover problem and propose a greedy algorithm with provable guarantees: it preserves query information within bounded slack, inherits $(1+\ln n)$ and $(1-1/e)$ approximations from submodular set cover, and enforces a diversity margin. Importantly, building the $\gamma$-cover is \emph{query-agnostic}: it incurs no online cost and can be computed once offline and amortized across all queries. Experiments on HotpotQA show that $\gamma$-covering consistently improves over BM25, a competitive baseline, and provides clear advantages in hard-decision regimes such as context compression and single-slot prompt selection. These results establish DI $\gamma$-covering as a principled, self-organizing backbone for modern LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.

Abstract: We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large, execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability. We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective, and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches 93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match). In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization, to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion. Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to the best baseline. The code will be available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TGPO

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs) use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.

Abstract: Effective analysis of cybersecurity and threat intelligence data demands language models that can interpret specialized terminology, complex document structures, and the interdependence of natural language and source code. Encoder-only transformer architectures provide efficient and robust representations that support critical tasks such as semantic search, technical entity extraction, and semantic analysis, which are key to automated threat detection, incident triage, and vulnerability assessment. However, general-purpose language models often lack the domain-specific adaptation required for high precision. We present SecureBERT 2.0, an enhanced encoder-only language model purpose-built for cybersecurity applications. Leveraging the ModernBERT architecture, SecureBERT 2.0 introduces improved long-context modeling and hierarchical encoding, enabling effective processing of extended and heterogeneous documents, including threat reports and source code artifacts. Pretrained on a domain-specific corpus more than thirteen times larger than its predecessor, comprising over 13 billion text tokens and 53 million code tokens from diverse real-world sources, SecureBERT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in semantic search for threat intelligence, semantic analysis, cybersecurity-specific named entity recognition, and automated vulnerability detection in code within the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: With the European Union introducing gender quotas on corporate boards, this study investigates the impact of board gender diversity (BGD) on firms' carbon emission performance (CEP). Using panel regressions and advanced machine learning algorithms on data from European firms between 2016 and 2022, the analyses reveal a significant non-linear relationship. Specifically, CEP improves with BGD up to an optimal level of approximately 35 percent, beyond which further increases in BGD yield no additional improvement in CEP. A minimum threshold of 22 percent BGD is necessary for meaningful improvements in CEP. To assess the legitimacy of CEP outcomes, this study examines whether ESG controversies affect the relationship between BGD and CEP. The results show no significant effect, suggesting that the effect of BGD is driven by governance mechanisms rather than symbolic actions. Additionally, structural equation modelling (SEM) indicates that while environmental innovation contributes to CEP, it is not the mediating channel through which BGD promotes CEP. The results have implications for academics, businesses, and regulators.

Abstract: The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge aims to advance neural audio coding for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The first edition focuses on low-resource neural speech codecs that must operate reliably under everyday noise and reverberation, while satisfying strict constraints on computational complexity, latency, and bitrate. Track 1 targets transparency codecs, which aim to preserve the perceptual transparency of input speech under mild noise and reverberation. Track 2 addresses enhancement codecs, which combine coding and compression with denoising and dereverberation. This paper presents the official baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC Challenge. The baselines are convolutional neural codec models with Residual Vector Quantization, trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and reconstruction objectives. We detail the data filtering and augmentation strategies, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint selection criteria.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers, reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations. High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs. Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as 1-2 hours.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a non-local five-moment electron pressure tensor closure parametrized by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions, susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.

Abstract: We study counterfactual stochastic optimization of conditional loss functionals under misspecified and noisy gradient information. The difficulty is that when the conditioning event has vanishing or zero probability, naive Monte Carlo estimators are prohibitively inefficient; kernel smoothing, though common, suffers from slow convergence. We propose a two-stage kernel-free methodology. First, we show using Malliavin calculus that the conditional loss functional of a diffusion process admits an exact representation as a Skorohod integral, yielding variance comparable to classical Monte-Carlo variance. Second, we establish that a weak derivative estimate of the conditional loss functional with respect to model parameters can be evaluated with constant variance, in contrast to the widely used score function method whose variance grows linearly in the sample path length. Together, these results yield an efficient framework for counterfactual conditional stochastic gradient algorithms in rare-event regimes.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Abstract: Standard techniques for differentially private estimation, such as Laplace or Gaussian noise addition, require guaranteed bounds on the sensitivity of the estimator in question. But such sensitivity bounds are often large or simply unknown. Thus we seek differentially private methods that can be applied to arbitrary black-box functions. A handful of such techniques exist, but all are either inefficient in their use of data or require evaluating the function on exponentially many inputs. In this work we present a scheme that trades off between statistical efficiency (i.e., how much data is needed) and oracle efficiency (i.e., the number of evaluations). We also present lower bounds showing the near-optimality of our scheme.

Abstract: Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github repo}.

<title>Structural Refinement of Bayesian Networks for Efficient Model Parameterisation</title>

Abstract: Many Bayesian network modelling applications suffer from the issue of data scarcity. Hence the use of expert judgement often becomes necessary to determine the parameters of the conditional probability tables (CPTs) throughout the network. There are usually a prohibitively large number of these parameters to determine, even when complementing any available data with expert judgements. To address this challenge, a number of CPT approximation methods have been developed that reduce the quantity and complexity of parameters needing to be determined to fully parameterise a Bayesian network. This paper provides a review of a variety of structural refinement methods that can be used in practice to efficiently approximate a CPT within a Bayesian network. We not only introduce and discuss the intrinsic properties and requirements of each method, but we evaluate each method through a worked example on a Bayesian network model of cardiovascular risk assessment. We conclude with practical guidance to help Bayesian network practitioners choose an alternative approach when direct parameterisation of a CPT is infeasible.

<title>Navigating the Synchrony-Stability Frontier in Adaptive Chatbots</title>

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora (DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility," showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system maintainability.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential, autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Abstract: Neural network approaches that parameterize value functions have succeeded in approximating high-dimensional optimal feedback controllers when the Hamiltonian admits explicit formulas. However, many practical problems, such as the space shuttle reentry problem and bicycle dynamics, among others, may involve implicit Hamiltonians that do not admit explicit formulas, limiting the applicability of existing methods. Rather than directly parameterizing controls, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we propose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly parameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws. Our method enforces physical principles by ensuring trained networks adhere to the control laws by exploiting the fundamental relationship between the optimal control and the value function's gradient; this is a direct consequence of the connection between Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and dynamic programming. Using Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), we achieve efficient training despite temporal coupling in trajectory optimization. We show that JFB produces descent directions for the optimal control objective and experimentally demonstrate that our approach effectively learns high-dimensional feedback controllers across multiple scenarios involving implicit Hamiltonians, which existing methods cannot address.

Abstract: Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i) straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive simulations and a real-data application.

Abstract: Earthquake ground motions and the related damage can be significantly impacted by near-surface soils. Accurate predictions of seismic hazard require depth-continuous models of soil stiffness, commonly described in terms of shear-wave velocity (VS). For regional-scale studies, efforts to predict VS remotely, such as the U.S. Geological Survey's National Crustal Model, tend to emphasize deeper lithologic velocity structures, thus simplifying important near-surface soil velocity variations, and tend to be produced at relatively coarse geospatial resolution for one geographic area. In this study, we define a functional form to describe VS-with-depth across the conterminous U.S. We calibrate the parameters of the function using a national compilation of more than 9,000 in-situ geotechnical measurements. By coupling the parametric framework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to provide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface geotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model and supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and coseismic hazard assessments.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide. While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model. Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic characterization in neurological diseases.

Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be useful in various applications such as travel time prediction, prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting. Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE (Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from 10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon. Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute horizons compared to analytical models.

Abstract: An algorithm is proposed, analyzed, and tested for solving continuous nonlinear-equality-constrained optimization problems where the constraints are defined by an expectation or an average over a large (finite) number of terms. The main idea of the algorithm is to solve a sequence of equality-constrained problems, each involving a finite sample of constraint-function terms, over which the sample set grows progressively. Under assumptions about the constraint functions and their first- and second-order derivatives that are reasonable in some real-world settings of interest, it is shown that -- with a sufficiently large initial sample -- solving a sequence of problems defined through progressive sampling yields a better worst-case sample complexity bound compared to solving a single problem with a full set of samples. The results of numerical experiments with a set of test problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can be effective in practice.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions. The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

Abstract: Large language models have gained widespread prominence, yet their vulnerability to prompt injection and other adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. This paper argues for a security-by-design AI paradigm that proactively mitigates LLM vulnerabilities while enhancing performance. To achieve this, we introduce PromptShield, an ontology-driven framework that ensures deterministic and secure prompt interactions. It standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events related to malicious activities and anomalies. By simulating prompt injection attacks and assessing the impact of deploying PromptShield, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in model security and performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 94%. Notably, the ontology-based framework not only mitigates adversarial threats but also enhances the overall performance and reliability of the system. Furthermore, PromptShield's modular and adaptable design ensures its applicability beyond cloud security, making it a robust solution for safeguarding generative AI applications across various domains. By laying the groundwork for AI safety standards and informing future policy development, this work stimulates a crucial dialogue on the pivotal role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF), an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic logs while improving efficiency and accuracy. CIAF standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistency in log interpretation. This not only enhances data quality but also provides investigators with reliable, standardized information for decision-making. To evaluate security and performance, we analyzed Microsoft Azure logs containing ransomware-related events. By simulating attacks and assessing CIAF's impact, results showed significant improvement in ransomware detection, achieving precision, recall, and F1 scores of 93 percent. CIAF's modular, adaptable design extends beyond ransomware, making it a robust solution for diverse cyberattacks. By laying the foundation for standardized forensic methodologies and informing future AI-driven automation, this work underscores the role of deterministic prompt engineering and ontology-based validation in enhancing cloud forensic investigations. These advancements improve cloud security while paving the way for efficient, automated forensic workflows.

Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection. In particular, we focus on AdaDetect, a powerful learning-based framework for novelty detection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. While AdaDetect provides rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, its behavior under adversarial perturbations remains unexplored. We first formulate an oracle attack setting that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR, deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks. This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack scheme that only requires query access to AdaDetect's output labels. Coupling these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of AdaDetect on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust alternatives.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust, transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study, concept-augmented explanations disambiguate token roles. In a user study on the programming-language classification task, concept-augmented explanations disambiguated token roles and improved human-centric explainability by 37 percentage points compared with token-level attributions using Integrated Gradients.

Abstract: When training large-scale models, the performance typically scales with the number of parameters and the dataset size according to a slow power law. A fundamental theoretical and practical question is whether comparable performance can be achieved with significantly smaller models and substantially less data. In this work, we provide a positive and constructive answer. We prove that a generic permutation-invariant function of $d$ objects can be asymptotically compressed into a function of $\operatorname{polylog} d$ objects with vanishing error. This theorem yields two key implications: (Ia) a large neural network can be compressed to polylogarithmic width while preserving its learning dynamics; (Ib) a large dataset can be compressed to polylogarithmic size while leaving the loss landscape of the corresponding model unchanged. (Ia) directly establishes a proof of the \textit{dynamical} lottery ticket hypothesis, which states that any ordinary network can be strongly compressed such that the learning dynamics and result remain unchanged. (Ib) shows that a neural scaling law of the form $L\sim d^{-\alpha}$ can be boosted to an arbitrarily fast power law decay, and ultimately to $\exp(-\alpha' \sqrt[m]{d})$.

Abstract: The transcriptional response to genetic perturbation reveals fundamental insights into complex cellular systems. While current approaches have made progress in predicting genetic perturbation responses, they provide limited biological understanding and cannot systematically refine existing knowledge. Overcoming these limitations requires an end-to-end integration of data-driven learning and existing knowledge. However, this integration is challenging due to inconsistencies between data and knowledge bases, such as noise, misannotation, and incompleteness. To address this challenge, we propose ALIGNED (Adaptive aLignment for Inconsistent Genetic kNowledgE and Data), a neuro-symbolic framework based on the Abductive Learning (ABL) paradigm. This end-to-end framework aligns neural and symbolic components and performs systematic knowledge refinement. We introduce a balanced consistency metric to evaluate the predictions' consistency against both data and knowledge. Our results show that ALIGNED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest balanced consistency, while also re-discovering biologically meaningful knowledge. Our work advances beyond existing methods to enable both the transparency and the evolution of mechanistic biological understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality performance across languages requires substantial training data for each individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages, they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the usefulness of our approach.

<title>Beyond Log Likelihood: Probability-Based Objectives for Supervised Fine-Tuning across the Model Capability Continuum</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood (NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch, post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants) consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for interpretability in machine learning, functional ANOVA decomposition has gained renewed attention as a principled tool for breaking down high-dimensional function into low-dimensional components that reveal the contributions of different variable groups. Recently, Tensor Product Neural Network (TPNN) has been developed and applied as basis functions in the functional ANOVA model, referred to as ANOVA-TPNN. A disadvantage of ANOVA-TPNN, however, is that the components to be estimated must be specified in advance, which makes it difficult to incorporate higher-order TPNNs into the functional ANOVA model due to computational and memory constraints. In this work, we propose Bayesian-TPNN, a Bayesian inference procedure for the functional ANOVA model with TPNN basis functions, enabling the detection of higher-order components with reduced computational cost compared to ANOVA-TPNN. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and demonstrate that Bayesian-TPNN performs well by analyzing multiple benchmark datasets. Theoretically, we prove that the posterior of Bayesian-TPNN is consistent.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

Abstract: Recovering a low-CP-rank tensor from noisy linear measurements is a central challenge in high-dimensional data analysis, with applications spanning tensor PCA, tensor regression, and beyond. We exploit the intrinsic geometry of rank-one tensors by casting the recovery task as an optimization problem over the Segre manifold, the smooth Riemannian manifold of rank-one tensors. This geometric viewpoint yields two powerful algorithms: Riemannian Gradient Descent (RGD) and Riemannian Gauss-Newton (RGN), each of which preserves feasibility at every iteration. Under mild noise assumptions, we prove that RGD converges at a local linear rate, while RGN exhibits an initial local quadratic convergence phase that transitions to a linear rate as the iterates approach the statistical noise floor. Extensive synthetic experiments validate these convergence guarantees and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning (STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts (ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts. This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization, and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings, demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) face persistent challenges due to evolving cyberattacks, high-dimensional traffic data, and severe class imbalance in benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD. To address these issues, we propose IntrusionX, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling. The architecture is further optimized using the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), enabling effective hyperparameter tuning while maintaining computational efficiency. Our pipeline incorporates rigorous preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting to enhance the detection of rare classes. Experimental evaluation on NSL-KDD demonstrates that IntrusionX achieves 98% accuracy in binary classification and 87% in 5-class classification, with significant improvements in minority class recall (U2R: 71%, R2L: 93%). The novelty of IntrusionX lies in its reproducible, imbalance-aware design with metaheuristic optimization.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a. Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions. However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast, editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media. Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent (AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at https://github.com/i-vesseg/MultiVesSeg.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However, this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges, or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work, we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round. Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses naturally dominate the information flow.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope. Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design provides a principled framework for selecting experimental settings that maximize obtained information. In this work, we focus on estimating the expected information gain in the setting where the differential entropy of the likelihood is either independent of the design or can be evaluated explicitly. This reduces the problem to maximum entropy estimation, alleviating several challenges inherent in expected information gain computation.
  Our study is motivated by large-scale inference problems, such as inverse problems, where the computational cost is dominated by expensive likelihood evaluations. We propose a computational approach in which the evidence density is approximated by a Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo surrogate, while the differential entropy is evaluated using standard methods without additional likelihood evaluations. We prove that this strategy achieves convergence rates that are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art methods for full expected information gain estimation, particularly when the cost of entropy evaluation is negligible. Moreover, our approach relies only on mild smoothness of the forward map and avoids stronger technical assumptions required in earlier work. We also present numerical experiments, which confirm our theoretical findings.

<title>Discovering Communities in Continuous-Time Temporal Networks by Optimizing L-Modularity</title>

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with many applications in various fields. Extending community detection to the temporal setting with exact temporal accuracy, as required by real-world dynamic data, necessitates methods specifically adapted to the temporal nature of interactions. We introduce LAGO, a novel method for uncovering dynamic communities by greedy optimization of Longitudinal Modularity, a specific adaptation of Modularity for continuous-time networks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on time discretization or assume rigid community evolution, LAGO captures the precise moments when nodes enter and exit communities. We evaluate LAGO on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently uncover temporally and topologically coherent communities.

Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized the prediction of rigid protein structures, modelling the conformational ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) remains a key frontier. Current AI paradigms present a trade-off: Protein Language Models (PLMs) capture evolutionary statistics but lack explicit physical grounding, while generative models trained to model full ensembles are computationally expensive. In this work we critically assess these limits and propose a path forward. We introduce GeoGraph, a simulation-informed surrogate trained to predict ensemble-averaged statistics of residue-residue contact-map topology directly from sequence. By featurizing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations into residue- and sequence-level graph descriptors, we create a robust and information-rich learning target. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields representations that are more predictive of key biophysical properties than existing methods.

<title>Non-Euclidean Broximal Point Method: A Blueprint for Geometry-Aware Optimization</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed Broximal Point Method (BPM) [Gruntkowska et al., 2025] offers an idealized optimization framework based on iteratively minimizing the objective function over norm balls centered at the current iterate. It enjoys striking global convergence guarantees, converging linearly and in a finite number of steps for proper, closed and convex functions. However, its theoretical analysis has so far been confined to the Euclidean geometry. At the same time, emerging trends in deep learning optimization, exemplified by algorithms such as Muon [Jordan et al., 2024] and Scion [Pethick et al., 2025], demonstrate the practical advantages of minimizing over balls defined via non-Euclidean norms which better align with the underlying geometry of the associated loss landscapes. In this note, we ask whether the convergence theory of BPM can be extended to this more general, non-Euclidean setting. We give a positive answer, showing that most of the elegant guarantees of the original method carry over to arbitrary norm geometries. Along the way, we clarify which properties are preserved and which necessarily break down when leaving the Euclidean realm. Our analysis positions Non-Euclidean BPM as a conceptual blueprint for understanding a broad class of geometry-aware optimization algorithms, shedding light on the principles behind their practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2 of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

<title>Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?</title>

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

<title>AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification</title>

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage, causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance, interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D (AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Abstract: Constitutive evaluations often dominate the computational cost of finite element (FE) simulations whenever material models are complex. Neural constitutive models (NCMs) offer a highly expressive and flexible framework for modeling complex material behavior in solid mechanics. However, their practical adoption in large-scale FE simulations remains limited due to significant computational costs, especially in repeatedly evaluating stress and stiffness. NCMs thus represent an extreme case: their large computational graphs make stress and stiffness evaluations prohibitively expensive, restricting their use to small-scale problems. In this work, we introduce COMMET, an open-source FE framework whose architecture has been redesigned from the ground up to accelerate high-cost constitutive updates. Our framework features a novel assembly algorithm that supports batched and vectorized constitutive evaluations, compute-graph-optimized derivatives that replace automatic differentiation, and distributed-memory parallelism via MPI. These advances dramatically reduce runtime, with speed-ups exceeding three orders of magnitude relative to traditional non-vectorized automatic differentiation-based implementations. While we demonstrate these gains primarily for NCMs, the same principles apply broadly wherever for-loop based assembly or constitutive updates limit performance, establishing a new standard for large-scale, high-fidelity simulations in computational mechanics.

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning deals with training a novice policy from expert demonstrations in an online fashion. The established DAgger algorithm trains a robust novice policy by alternating between interacting with the environment and retraining of the network. Many variants thereof exist, that differ in the method of discerning whether to allow the novice to act or return control to the expert. We propose the use of stochastic reachtubes - common in verification of dynamical systems - as a novel method for estimating the necessity of expert intervention. Our approach does not require fine-tuning of decision thresholds per environment and effectively reduces the number of expert interventions, especially when compared with related approaches that make use of a doubt classification model.

Abstract: This work introduces a new framework for modeling financial markets through an interpretable probabilistic state machine. By clustering historical returns based on momentum and risk features across multiple time horizons, we identify distinct market states that capture underlying regimes, such as expansion phase, contraction, crisis, or recovery. From a transition matrix representing the dynamics between these states, we construct a probabilistic state machine that models the temporal evolution of the market. This state machine enables the generation of a custom distribution of returns based on a mixture of Gaussian components weighted by state frequencies. We show that the proposed benchmark significantly outperforms the traditional approach in capturing key statistical properties of asset returns, including skewness and kurtosis, and our experiments across random assets and time periods confirm its robustness.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML)-based network models provide fast and accurate predictions for complex network behaviors but require substantial training data. Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited, especially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers commonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are deployed in real environments. We propose a hybrid approach leveraging transfer learning to combine simulated and real-world data. Using RouteNet-Fermi, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset significantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom testbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay prediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and with 50 scenarios, by 48%.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups, enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle, seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g., WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months, flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries and about 6,000 parts.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other previous work.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size, and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without the need for domain knowledge.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary, natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap for future research toward making models more transparent.

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance, resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD (ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action (VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging existing policies.

Abstract: Wind farm placement arranges the size and the location of multiple wind farms within a given region. The power output is highly related to the wind speed on spatial and temporal levels, which can be modeled by advanced data-driven approaches. To this end, we use a probabilistic neural network as a surrogate that accounts for the spatiotemporal correlations of wind speed. This neural network uses ReLU activation functions so that it can be reformulated as mixed-integer linear set of constraints (constraint learning). We embed these constraints into the placement decision problem, formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. Specifically, conditional quantiles of the total electricity production are regarded as recursive decisions in the second stage. We use real high-resolution regional data from a northern region in Spain. We validate that the constraint learning approach outperforms the classical bilinear interpolation method. Numerical experiments are implemented on risk-averse investors. The results indicate that risk-averse investors concentrate on dominant sites with strong wind, while exhibiting spatial diversification and sensitive capacity spread in non-dominant sites. Furthermore, we show that if we introduce transmission line costs in the problem, risk-averse investors favor locations closer to the substations. On the contrary, risk-neutral investors are willing to move to further locations to achieve higher expected profits. Our results conclude that the proposed novel approach is able to tackle a portfolio of regional wind farm placements and further provide guidance for risk-averse investors.

<title>Theory of Scaling Laws for In-Context Regression: Depth, Width, Context and Time</title>

Abstract: We study in-context learning (ICL) of linear regression in a deep linear self-attention model, characterizing how performance depends on various computational and statistical resources (width, depth, number of training steps, batch size and data per context). In a joint limit where data dimension, context length, and residual stream width scale proportionally, we analyze the limiting asymptotics for three ICL settings: (1) isotropic covariates and tasks (ISO), (2) fixed and structured covariance (FS), and (3) where covariances are randomly rotated and structured (RRS). For ISO and FS settings, we find that depth only aids ICL performance if context length is limited. Alternatively, in the RRS setting where covariances change across contexts, increasing the depth leads to significant improvements in ICL, even at infinite context length. This provides a new solvable toy model of neural scaling laws which depends on both width and depth of a transformer and predicts an optimal transformer shape as a function of compute. This toy model enables computation of exact asymptotics for the risk as well as derivation of powerlaws under source/capacity conditions for the ICL tasks.

Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others. This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50% and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations, unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the project.

Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.

arXiv:2510.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so, by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time, which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed. We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Abstract: This paper focuses on representation learning for dynamic graphs with temporal interactions. A fundamental issue is that both the graph structure and the nodes own their own dynamics, and their blending induces intractable complexity in the temporal evolution over graphs. Drawing inspiration from the recent progress of physical dynamic models in deep neural networks, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations (GN-CDEs), a continuous-time framework that jointly models node embeddings and structural dynamics by incorporating a graph enhanced neural network vector field with a time-varying graph path as the control signal. Our framework exhibits several desirable characteristics, including the ability to express dynamics on evolving graphs without piecewise integration, the capability to calibrate trajectories with subsequent data, and robustness to missing observations. Empirical evaluation on a range of dynamic graph representation learning tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Recently, the Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT) problem has attracted the special attention of the ML community. In this problem, given two distributions supported on two (possibly different) spaces, one has to find the most isometric map between them. In the discrete variant of GWOT, the task is to learn an assignment between given discrete sets of points. In the more advanced continuous formulation, one aims at recovering a parametric mapping between unknown continuous distributions based on i.i.d. samples derived from them. The clear geometrical intuition behind the GWOT makes it a natural choice for several practical use cases, giving rise to a number of proposed solvers. Some of them claim to solve the continuous version of the problem. At the same time, GWOT is notoriously hard, both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, all existing continuous GWOT solvers still heavily rely on discrete techniques. Natural questions arise: to what extent do existing methods unravel the GWOT problem, what difficulties do they encounter, and under which conditions they are successful? Our benchmark paper is an attempt to answer these questions. We specifically focus on the continuous GWOT as the most interesting and debatable setup. We crash-test existing continuous GWOT approaches on different scenarios, carefully record and analyze the obtained results, and identify issues. Our findings experimentally testify that the scientific community is still missing a reliable continuous GWOT solver, which necessitates further research efforts. As the first step in this direction, we propose a new continuous GWOT method which does not rely on discrete techniques and partially solves some of the problems of the competitors.

Abstract: This article studies the Fisher-Rao gradient, also referred to as the natural gradient, of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) which plays a central role in generative machine learning. It reveals that the gap between the evidence and its lower bound, the ELBO, has essentially a vanishing natural gradient within unconstrained optimization. As a result, maximization of the ELBO is equivalent to minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence from a target distribution, the primary objective function of learning. Building on this insight, we derive a condition under which this equivalence persists even when optimization is constrained to a model. This condition yields a geometric characterization, which we formalize through the notion of a cylindrical model.

Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to reduce the computational burden of mobile devices and decrease the end-to-end inference latency in edge computing scenarios. While distributed DNNs have been studied, to the best of our knowledge, the resilience of distributed DNNs to adversarial action remains an open problem. In this paper, we fill the existing research gap by rigorously analyzing the robustness of distributed DNNs against adversarial action. We cast this problem in the context of information theory and rigorously proved that (i) the compressed latent dimension improves the robustness but also affect task-oriented performance; and (ii) the deeper splitting point enhances the robustness but also increases the computational burden. These two trade-offs provide a novel perspective to design robust distributed DNN. To test our theoretical findings, we perform extensive experimental analysis by considering 6 different DNN architectures, 6 different approaches for distributed DNN and 10 different adversarial attacks using the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: To enhance the computational efficiency of quantized Transformers, we replace the dot-product and Softmax-based attention with an alternative mechanism involving addition and ReLU activation only. This side-steps the expansion to double precision often required by matrix multiplication and avoids costly Softmax evaluations but maintains much of the core functionality of conventional dot-product attention. It can enable more efficient execution and support larger quantized Transformer models on resource-constrained hardware or alternative arithmetic systems like homomorphic encryption. Training experiments on four common benchmark tasks show test set prediction scores comparable to those of conventional Transformers with dot-product attention. Our scaling experiments also suggest significant computational savings, both in plaintext and under encryption. In particular, we believe that the ReLU and addition-based attention mechanism examined in this paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic encryption by avoiding the costly multiplication of encrypted variables.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of \textit{subsets with positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data manifold}. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a promising solution to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences, we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora on the ImageNet $64\times64$ dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11, on par with the performance of one-step consistency model.

Abstract: This paper examines in detail the geometric structure of principal component analysis (PCA) by considering in detail the distributions of both unrotated and rotated MNIST digits in the space defined by the lowest order PCA components. Since digits possessing salient geometric features are mapped to restricted regions far from the origin, they are predicted by neural networks with a greater accuracy than digits that are mapped to broad, diffuse and overlapping volumes of the low order PCA space. Motivated by these results, a new quantity, the local PCA entropy, obtained by dividing the spatial region spanned by the low order principal components into histogram bins and evaluating the entropy associated with the number of occurrences of each input class within a bin, is introduced. The metric locates the input data records that yield the largest confusion in prediction accuracy within reduced coordinate volumes that optimally discriminate among geometric features. As an example of the potential utility of the local PCA entropy, a simple data balancing procedure is realized by oversampling the data records in regions of large local entropy.

Abstract: The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework enables privacy-preserving machine learning by aggregating responses from disjoint subsets of sensitive data. Adaptations of PATE to tasks with inherent output diversity such as text generation, where the desired output is a sample from a distribution, face a core tension: as diversity increases, samples from different teachers are less likely to agree, but lower agreement results in reduced utility for the same privacy requirements. Yet suppressing diversity to artificially increase agreement is undesirable, as it distorts the output of the underlying model, and thus reduces output quality.
  We propose Hot PATE, a variant of PATE designed for diverse generative settings. We formalize the notion of a diversity-preserving ensemble sampler and introduce an efficient sampler that provably transfers diversity without incurring additional privacy cost. Hot PATE requires only API access to proprietary models and can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing Cold PATE samplers. Our empirical evaluations corroborate and quantify the benefits, showing significant improvements in the privacy utility trade-off on evaluated in-context learning tasks, both in preserving diversity and in returning relevant responses.

Abstract: Back in the early 20th century, a horse named Hans appeared to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks during exhibitions in Germany, while it actually relied solely on involuntary cues in the body language from the human trainer. Modern machine learning models are no different. These models are known to be sensitive to spurious correlations between non-essential features of the inputs (e.g., background, texture, and secondary objects) and the corresponding labels. Such features and their correlations with the labels are known as "spurious" because they tend to change with shifts in real-world data distributions, which can negatively impact the model's generalization and robustness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this emerging issue, along with a fine-grained taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art methods for addressing spurious correlations in machine learning models. Additionally, we summarize existing datasets, benchmarks, and metrics to facilitate future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of the broader impacts, the recent advancements, and future challenges in the era of generative AI, aiming to provide valuable insights for researchers in the related domains of the machine learning community.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representation are essential for real-world AI systems. Deep ensembles of Gaussian networks have proven highly effective for continuous regression due to their ability to flexibly represent aleatoric uncertainty via unrestricted heteroscedastic variance, which in turn enables accurate epistemic uncertainty estimation. However, no analogous approach exists for count regression, despite many important applications. To address this gap, we propose the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN), a novel neural discrete count regression model that outputs the parameters of the Double Poisson distribution, enabling arbitrarily high or low predictive aleatoric uncertainty for count data and improving epistemic uncertainty estimation when ensembled. We formalize and prove that DDPN exhibits robust regression properties similar to heteroscedastic Gaussian models via learnable loss attenuation, and introduce a simple loss modification to control this behavior. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DDPN outperforms current baselines in accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection, establishing a new state-of-the-art in deep count regression.

Abstract: Deep learning systems deployed in real-world applications often encounter data that is different from their in-distribution (ID). A reliable model should ideally abstain from making decisions in this out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on feature distances, such as k-th nearest neighbors and distances to decision boundaries, either overlooking or ineffectively using in-distribution statistics. In this work, we propose a novel angle-based metric for OOD detection that is computed relative to the in-distribution structure. We demonstrate that the angles between feature representations and decision boundaries, viewed from the mean of in-distribution features, serve as an effective discriminative factor between ID and OOD data. We evaluate our method on nine ImageNet-pretrained models. Our approach achieves the lowest FPR in 5 out of 9 ImageNet models, obtains the best average FPR overall, and consistently ranking among the top 3 across all evaluated models. Furthermore, we highlight the benefits of contrastive representations by showing strong performance with ResNet SCL and CLIP architectures. Finally, we demonstrate that the scale-invariant nature of our score enables an ensemble strategy via simple score summation. Code is available at https://github.com/berkerdemirel/ORA-OOD-Detection-with-Relative-Angles.

Abstract: Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TFPS, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS.

This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on understanding the interaction dynamics between molecules, which is crucial for applications ranging from catalyst engineering to drug discovery. Despite recent progress, earlier MRL approaches are limited to using only the 2D topological structure of molecules, as obtaining the 3D interaction geometry remains prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a novel 3D geometric pre-training strategy for MRL (3DMRL) that incorporates a 3D virtual interaction environment, overcoming the limitations of costly traditional quantum mechanical calculation methods. With the constructed 3D virtual interaction environment, 3DMRL trains 2D MRL model to learn the global and local 3D geometric information of molecular interaction. Extensive experiments on various tasks using real-world datasets, including out-of-distribution and extrapolation scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DMRL, showing up to a 24.93% improvement in performance across 40 tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/3DMRL.

Abstract: We introduce Krony-PT, a compression technique for GPT-2 based on Kronecker products. We specifically target the feed-forward weights of each transformer block, and systematically compress the feed-forward layer matrices to various degrees. We introduce a modified Van Loan decomposition to initialize new Kronecker factors, and also propose a new pruning-based initialization technique. Our method compresses the original 124M-parameter GPT-2 to various smaller models, ranging from 80M to 96M. Our 81M model variant outperforms DistilGPT2 on next-token prediction across all standard language modeling datasets, and shows competitive or comparable performance with significantly larger Kronecker-based compressions of GPT-2.

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a decentralized machine learning technique, allowing clients to train a global model collaboratively without sharing private data. However, most FL studies ignore the crucial challenge of heterogeneous domains where each client has a distinct feature distribution, which is popular in real-world scenarios. Prototype learning, which leverages the mean feature vectors within the same classes, has become a prominent solution for federated learning under domain shift. However, existing federated prototype learning methods focus soley on inter-domain prototypes and neglect intra-domain perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel federated prototype learning method, namely I$^2$PFL, which incorporates $\textbf{I}$ntra-domain and $\textbf{I}$nter-domain $\textbf{P}$rototypes, to mitigate domain shift from both perspectives and learn a generalized global model across multiple domains in federated learning. To construct intra-domain prototypes, we propose feature alignment with MixUp-based augmented prototypes to capture the diversity within local domains and enhance the generalization of local features. Additionally, we introduce a reweighting mechanism for inter-domain prototypes to generate generalized prototypes that reduce domain shift while providing inter-domain knowledge across multiple clients. Extensive experiments on the Digits, Office-10, and PACS datasets illustrate the superior performance of our method compared to other baselines.

<title>CYCle: Choosing Your Collaborators Wisely to Enhance Collaborative Fairness in Decentralized Learning</title>

Abstract: Collaborative learning (CL) enables multiple participants to jointly train machine learning (ML) models on decentralized data sources without raw data sharing. While the primary goal of CL is to maximize the expected accuracy gain for each participant, it is also important to ensure that the gains are fairly distributed: no client should be negatively impacted, and gains should reflect contributions. Most existing CL methods require central coordination and focus only on gain maximization, overlooking fairness. In this work, we first show that the existing measure of collaborative fairness based on the correlation between accuracy values without and with collaboration has drawbacks because it does not account for negative collaboration gain. We argue that maximizing mean collaboration gain (MCG) while simultaneously minimizing the collaboration gain spread (CGS) is a fairer alternative. Next, we propose the CYCle protocol that enables individual participants in a private decentralized learning (PDL) framework to achieve this objective through a novel reputation scoring method based on gradient alignment between the local cross-entropy and distillation losses. We further extend the CYCle protocol to operate on top of gossip-based decentralized algorithms such as Gossip-SGD. We also theoretically show that CYCle performs better than standard FedAvg in a two-client mean estimation setting under high heterogeneity. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CYCle protocol to ensure positive and fair collaboration gain for all participants, even in cases where the data distributions of participants are highly skewed.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) excel in zero-shot tasks but benefit from task-specific adaptation. However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a key technique for adapting large pre-trained Decision Transformers (DTs) in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly in multi-task and few-shot settings. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables task generalization via trajectory prompts sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations -- without accounting for prompt informativeness. In this work, we propose a bandit-based prompt-tuning method that learns to construct optimal trajectory prompts from demonstration data at inference time. We devise a structured bandit architecture operating in the trajectory prompt space, achieving linear rather than combinatorial scaling with prompt size. Additionally, we show that the pre-trained PDT itself can serve as a powerful feature extractor for the bandit, enabling efficient reward modeling across various environments. We theoretically establish regret bounds and demonstrate empirically that our method consistently enhances performance across a wide range of tasks, high-dimensional environments, and out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines in prompt tuning.

Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in task transfer, they often struggle to accurately analyze molecular features due to limited knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this issue, we present Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules and exhibits explainability and reasoning ability. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental molecular features, taking into account the essential abilities for molecular reasoning. Further, to improve molecular understanding, we propose a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and providing informative responses, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for forecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art models. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models, ensuring only the most effective updates are retained and improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our algorithms as open-source on GitHub

Abstract: Top-down images play an important role in safety-critical settings such as autonomous navigation and aerial surveillance, where they provide holistic spatial information that front-view images cannot capture. Despite this, Vision Language Models (VLMs) are mostly trained and evaluated on front-view benchmarks, leaving their performance in the top-down setting poorly understood. Existing evaluations also overlook a unique property of top-down images: their physical meaning is preserved under rotation. In addition, conventional accuracy metrics can be misleading, since they are often inflated by hallucinations or "lucky guesses", which obscures a model's true reliability and its grounding in visual evidence. To address these issues, we introduce TDBench, a benchmark for top-down image understanding that includes 2000 curated questions for each rotation. We further propose RotationalEval (RE), which measures whether models provide consistent answers across four rotated views of the same scene, and we develop a reliability framework that separates genuine knowledge from chance. Finally, we conduct four case studies targeting underexplored real-world challenges. By combining rigorous evaluation with reliability metrics, TDBench not only benchmarks VLMs in top-down perception but also provides a new perspective on trustworthiness, guiding the development of more robust and grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as the leading approach for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, it faces a fundamental compute and memory asymmetry: rollout generation is embarrassingly parallel and memory-light, whereas policy updates are communication-heavy and memory-intensive. To address this, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), which decouples rollout generation from policy updates by training only on a strategically selected subset of rollouts, maintaining learning quality while dramatically reducing update costs. We propose a principled subset selection criterion, max-variance down-sampling, that maximizes reward diversity, and provide an efficient $O(n\log n)$ implementation. Empirically, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with PODS achieves the peak test accuracy of vanilla GRPO at least $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ faster across the different reasoning benchmarks and hardware configurations we tested.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms. Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to 50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation ("forgetting") mechanisms that are inherently coupled to the time scale of state evolution. As forgetting is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on arbitrary time scales. We analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under a simple, flexible parameterization. Without introducing additional complexity, D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on long-range learning tasks, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.

Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so-called adaptive edge of stability regime during training, leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, and damping oscillations. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam, we create a powerful hybrid optimizer. For this optimizer, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis of operation at the edge of stability from a physical and control perspective for the momentum. Furthermore, we derive convergence bounds with the rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ for a stochastic non convex objective under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that VRAdam exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliable mathematical reasoning, and current verification methods are often computationally expensive. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), a highly efficient, lightweight post-hoc verifier designed to address this challenge. EORM uses an energy-based framework to rank Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions, learning to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning using only simple outcome labels, thus eliminating the need for expensive annotations. With only 55M parameters, over 127 times smaller than typical reward models, EORM boosts the accuracy of Llama 3 8B to 90.7\% on GSM8k and 63.7\% on MATH. This performance is achieved by efficiently selecting the optimal reasoning path from a pool of candidates, allowing it to match or exceed the accuracy of far more resource-intensive Best-of-N sampling techniques. Crucially, our experiments show that EORM generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution problems and unseen models, indicating it learns fundamental principles of valid reasoning. This robustness, combined with its efficiency, establishes EORM as a practical tool for deploying more dependable LLMs in complex, real-world applications.

Abstract: Concept-based explanation methods aim at making machine learning models more transparent by finding the most important semantic features of an input (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) for a given prediction task. However, these methods generally ignore the communicative context of explanations, such as the preferences of a listener. For example, medical doctors understand explanations in terms of clinical markers, but patients may not, needing a different vocabulary to rationalize the same diagnosis. We address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the rational speech act. We introduce an iterative training procedure based on direct preference optimization where a speaker learns to compose explanations that maximize communicative utility for a listener. Our approach only needs access to pairwise preferences, which can be collected from human feedback, making it particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where a model of the listener may not be available. We demonstrate that our method is able to align speakers with the preferences of simulated listeners on image classification across three datasets, and further validate that pragmatic explanations generated with our method improve the classification accuracy of participants in a user study.

Abstract: We show that training a single $d$-dimensional steering vector per layer with reinforcement learning, while freezing all base weights, matches the accuracy of fully RL-tuned reasoning models on mathematical-reasoning tasks. On an 8 billion-parameter model this adds only $\approx 0.0016\%$ additional parameters and reproduces performance across a range of base models and mathematical-reasoning benchmarks. These results tighten the upper bound on the parameter budget required for high-level chain-of-thought reasoning, indicating that millions of adapter weights are unnecessary. The minimal trainable footprint reduces optimizer memory and inter-GPU communication, lowering the overall cost of fine-tuning. Moreover, a logit-lens analysis shows that the learned vectors amplify coherent token directions, providing clearer insight into the model's internal computations.

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers broader insights, such approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all these perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to realistic settings like AdamW. We empirically validate that a CNN and a Transformer are accurately replicated by this reformulation. Second, we derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature maps. Their effectiveness for parameter pruning is comparable to existing methods, demonstrating their value for model component attribution. Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking. Our findings support previously proposed stages of Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded, unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

<title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These ``hidden gifts'' represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus this act for others is a ``hidden gift''. We show that several different state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including MARL specific architectures, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that decentralized actor-critic policy gradient agents can succeed when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for policy gradient agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of ``hidden gifts'', and demonstrate that self learning-awareness in decentralized agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models, boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings. The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a finite discounted Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which leads to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and $\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$. We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on $|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds reveal that the PAC-bounds are tight in the parameters $S,A,\delta,\varepsilon$ and that unlike in the classical setting it is not possible to have polynomial dependence in all model parameters.

<title>PCoreSet: Effective Active Learning through Knowledge Distillation from Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by transferring the knowledge from teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we first introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs-i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects probabilistically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Extensive evaluations on 11 datasets show that ActiveKD consistently improves performance across selection methods (e.g., +29.07% on ImageNet, averaged over methods). Under ActiveKD, PCoreSet ranks first in 64/73 settings (approximately 87.7%) across 5 student and 3 teacher networks, always achieving the best performance except for first 2 AL rounds. Our code is available at https://github.com/erjui/PCoreSet.

Abstract: We propose Guided Speculative Inference (GSI), a novel algorithm for efficient reward-guided decoding in large language models. GSI combines soft best-of-$n$ test-time scaling with a reward model $r(x,y)$ and speculative samples from a small auxiliary model $\pi_S(y\mid x)$. We provably approximate both the optimal tilted policy $\pi_{\beta,B}(y\mid x) \propto \pi_B(y\mid x)\exp(\beta\,r(x,y))$ of soft best-of-$n$ under the base model $\pi_B$, as well as the expected reward under the optimal policy. In experiments on reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math, MMLU-STEM, GSM8K), our method achieves higher accuracy than standard soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_S$ and reward-guided speculative decoding (Liao et al., 2025), and in certain settings even outperforms soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_B$. The code is available at https://github.com/j-geuter/GSI .

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems that respect physical symmetries and constraints remains a fundamental challenge in data-driven modeling. Integrating physical laws with graph neural networks facilitates principled modeling of complex N-body dynamics and yields accurate and permutation-invariant models. However, training graph neural networks with iterative, gradient-based optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSProp, LBFGS) often leads to slow training, especially for large, complex systems. In comparison to 15 different optimizers, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian Graph Networks (HGN) can be trained up to 600x faster--but with comparable accuracy--by replacing iterative optimization with random feature-based parameter construction. We show robust performance in diverse simulations, including N-body mass-spring and molecular systems in up to 3 dimensions and 10,000 particles with different geometries, while retaining essential physical invariances with respect to permutation, rotation, and translation. Our proposed approach is benchmarked using a NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks Track publication to further demonstrate its versatility. We reveal that even when trained on minimal 8-node systems, the model can generalize in a zero-shot manner to systems as large as 4096 nodes without retraining. Our work challenges the dominance of iterative gradient-descent-based optimization algorithms for training neural network models for physical systems.

<title>LoRA Users Beware: A Few Spurious Tokens Can Manipulate Your Finetuned Model</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly finetuned for a variety of use cases and domains. A common approach is to leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) -- known to provide strong performance at low resource costs. In this study, we demonstrate that LoRA actually opens the door to short-cut vulnerabilities -- and the more resource efficient is the LoRA setup, the more vulnerable will be the finetuned model to aggressive attacks. To measure that vulnerability, we introduce Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI), where we find that LoRA exclusively focuses on even just a single token that is spuriously correlated with downstream labels. In short, injection of that spurious token during finetuning ensure that the model's prediction at test-time can be manipulated on-demand. We conducted experiments across model families and datasets to evaluate the impact of SSTI during LoRA finetuning while providing possible mitigations. Our experiments conclude that none of the existing checkers and preprocessors can sanitize a dataset raising new concerns for data quality and AI safety.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (ReFeri). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, ReFeri evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Abstract: Research on long-term time series prediction has primarily relied on Transformer and MLP models, while the potential of convolutional networks in this domain remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a lightweight variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improves efficiency but suffers from limited exploration and training instability, limiting its effectiveness on complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filter-Replay framework that augments GRPO across three dimensions: additional rollouts enable deeper and more targeted exploration, online filtering removes low-quality samples to stabilize gradients and accelerate training, and experience replay amplifies rare yet informative trajectories for stable convergence. This unified framework establishes a principled training cycle that balances exploration, efficiency, and stability. Experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame achieves consistent gains, including a 37.9\% relative improvement on Geometry3K over GRPO. EFRame further supports fine-grained sample categorization and precise entropy control, highlighting it as a robust solution for advancing deeper reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Abstract: Reasoning models that produce long, hidden chains of thought, have emerged as powerful tools for reasoning-intensive and agentic tasks. However, as the time horizons at which these models can operate grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly difficult to know how much progress the model is making on a task, making it challenging for users to set appropriate expectations about completion time. By probing the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find evidence that their reasoning progress can be quantified, with simple linear probes achieving 30\% accuracy over 10 progress classes and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.75. Rooted in this insight, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning method that trains existing reasoning models to explicitly generate progress estimates (0-100\%) during their reasoning process. We find that the predictions of our best fine-tuned language model for sequences below 16K tokens are on average 10\% from the true label.

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in performance.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations. As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential. Code is available in https://github.com/ZhanliangAaronWang/FR-CCA-ADNI.

Abstract: This work presents a novel, fully Riemannian framework for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that geometrically treats low-rank adapters by optimizing them directly on the fixed-rank manifold. This formulation eliminates the parametrization ambiguity present in standard Euclidean optimizers. Our framework integrates three key components to achieve this: (1) we derive Riemannion, a new Riemannian optimizer on the fixed-rank matrix manifold that generalizes the recently proposed Muon optimizer; (2) we develop a Riemannian gradient-informed LoRA initialization, and (3) we provide an efficient implementation without prominent overhead that uses automatic differentiation to compute arising geometric operations while adhering to best practices in numerical linear algebra. Comprehensive experimental results on both LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that our approach yields consistent and noticeable improvements in convergence speed and final task performance over both standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) provides a parameter-efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods rely on task-aware inference and maintain a growing set of task-specific prompts, which introduces two major challenges: (1) severe performance degradation on earlier tasks under task-agnostic inference, and (2) limited scalability due to prompt memory accumulation as task sequences grow. In this paper, we present GRID, a unified framework designed to address these challenges. GRID incorporates a decoding mechanism that enhances backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Furthermore, it employs a gradient-guided prompt selection strategy to compress less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, ensuring scalable and memory-efficient continual learning. Extensive experiments on long-sequence and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID improves average accuracy and backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and substantially reduces prompt memory usage.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth. While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations. First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm. Supported by efficient parallelized implementations, our design achieves effective classification and highly discriminative state representations. We extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small reasoning models, scoring 64.5 on AIME24 and 50.2 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more affordable accelerators. While GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale, its inner workings are described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure geometric meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical argument, and has two analytical consequences: first, the GPTQ error propagation step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; second, GPTQ inherits the error upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the assumption that no weights are clipped. Leveraging this bound, we design post-training quantization methods that avoid clipping, and outperform the original GPTQ. In addition, we provide efficient GPU inference kernels for the resulting representation. Taken together, these results place GPTQ on a firm theoretical footing and open the door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform previously unseen tasks using task specific prompts without updating parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification. To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate $L$-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify that the Lipschitz constant $L$ of nonlinear function classes as a key factor governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether $L$ is below or above a threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of transformers for unseen functions.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth\_Xtended.

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy has made machine unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees or rely on heuristic metrics such as accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new definition for MU based on conformal prediction (CP), providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize the proposed conformal criteria that quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose empirical metrics to measure the effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in removing targeted data.

Although this architecture has attained substantial success, the coupling between representation and value learning creates instability as representations must constantly adapt to non-stationary value targets, while value estimates depend on these shifting representations. This is compounded by high variance in bootstrapped targets, which causes bias in value estimation in off-policy methods. We introduce Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER), a framework for value-based RL that views representation and Q-learning as two strategic agents in a hierarchical game. SCORER models the Q-function as the leader, which commits to its strategy by updating less frequently, while the perception network (encoder) acts as the follower, adapting more frequently to learn representations that minimize Bellman error variance given the leader's committed strategy. Through this division of labor, the Q-function minimizes MSBE while perception minimizes its variance, thereby reducing bias accordingly, with asymmetric updates allowing stable co-adaptation, unlike simultaneous parameter updates in monolithic solutions. Our proposed SCORER framework leads to a bi-level optimization problem whose solution is approximated by a two-timescale algorithm that creates an asymmetric learning dynamic between the two players. Extensive experiments on DQN and its variants demonstrate that gains stem from algorithmic insight rather than model complexity.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code will soon be publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) has established diffusion policies as a high-performing paradigm for offline reinforcement learning, but its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation renders both training and inference slow and fragile. Existing efforts to accelerate DQL toward one-step denoising typically rely on auxiliary modules or policy distillation, sacrificing either simplicity or performance. It remains unclear whether a one-step policy can be trained directly without such trade-offs. To this end, we introduce One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables effective one-step action generation during both training and inference, without auxiliary modules or distillation. OFQL reformulates the DQL policy within the Flow Matching (FM) paradigm but departs from conventional FM by learning an average velocity field that directly supports accurate one-step action generation. This design removes the need for multi-step denoising and backpropagation-through-time updates, resulting in substantially faster and more robust learning. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that OFQL, despite generating actions in a single step, not only significantly reduces computation during both training and inference but also outperforms multi-step DQL by a large margin. Furthermore, OFQL surpasses all other baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in D4RL.

Abstract: LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such specialized models increases, merging them into a unified model without retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques operate at the level of individual layers, thereby overlooking the inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. We show that this simplification leads to distributional mismatches, particularly in methods that rely on intermediate activations, as changes in early layers are not properly propagated to downstream layers during merging. We identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training. To address this, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure that sequentially merges weights across layers while sequentially updating activation statistics. By explicitly accounting for inter-layer interactions, CoM mitigates covariate shift and produces a coherent merged model through a series of conditionally optimal updates. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Communication-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Federated LLM Fine-Tuning over Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However, transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods. Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the communication overhead further while providing richer representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead by approximately 50%.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes LLMs' internal computations remain unclear. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective. These vectors match full fine-tuning performance while preserving the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts and path-patching analyses on two models, we find that (i) the last-layer steering vector acts like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; (ii) the penultimate-layer vector leaves attention patterns largely intact and instead operates through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols; and (iii) middle layers de-emphasize non-English tokens. Next, we show that a SAE isolates features associated with correct generations. We also show that steering vectors (i) transfer to other models, (ii) combine across layers when trained in isolation, and (iii) concentrate magnitude on meaningful prompt segments under adaptive token-wise scaling. Taken together, these results deepen understanding of how trained steering vectors shape computation and should inform future work in activation engineering and the study of reasoning models.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest. We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

<title>Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection, Novelty Promotes Variation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing self-improvement approaches primarily rely on self-confirmation signals (e.g., confidence, entropy, or consistency) to generate rewards. This reliance drives models toward over-confident, majority-favored solutions, causing an entropy collapse that degrades pass@n and reasoning complexity. To address this, we propose EVOL-RL, a label-free framework that mirrors the evolutionary principle of balancing selection with variation. Concretely, EVOL-RL retains the majority-voted answer as an anchor for stability, but adds a novelty-aware reward that scores each sampled solution by how different its reasoning is from other concurrently generated responses. This majority-for-stability + novelty-for-exploration rule mirrors the variation-selection principle: selection prevents drift, while novelty prevents collapse. Evaluation results show that EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from baseline's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents in-domain diversity collapse but also improves out-of-domain generalization (from math reasoning to broader tasks, e.g., GPQA, MMLU-Pro, and BBEH). The code is available at: https://github.com/YujunZhou/EVOL-RL.

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss. Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to achieve an error bound $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation. Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing collapse.

Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI) addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification, and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior quality.

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.

Abstract: We consider feasibility and constrained optimization problems defined over smooth and/or strongly convex sets. These notions mirror their popular function counterparts but are much less explored in the first-order optimization literature. We propose new scalable, projection-free, accelerated first-order methods in these settings. Our methods avoid linear optimization or projection oracles, only using cheap one-dimensional linesearches and normal vector computations. Despite this, we derive optimal accelerated convergence guarantees of $O(1/T)$ for strongly convex problems, $O(1/T^2)$ for smooth problems, and accelerated linear convergence given both. Our algorithms and analysis are based on novel characterizations of the Minkowski gauge of smooth and/or strongly convex sets, which may be of independent interest: although the gauge is neither smooth nor strongly convex, we show the gauge squared inherits any structure present in the set.

Abstract: One of the most promising applications in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which offer significant quantum advantages over classical machine learning in various domains. However, QGANs suffer from mode collapse and lack explicit control over the features of generated outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfoQGAN, a novel quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial network that integrates the principles of InfoGAN with a QGAN architecture. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit for data generation, a classical discriminator, and a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to explicitly optimize the mutual information between latent codes and generated samples. Numerical simulations on synthetic 2D distributions and Iris dataset augmentation demonstrate that InfoQGAN effectively mitigates mode collapse while achieving robust feature disentanglement in the quantum generator. By leveraging these advantages, InfoQGAN not only enhances training stability but also improves data augmentation performance through controlled feature generation. These results highlight the potential of InfoQGAN as a foundational approach for advancing quantum generative modeling in the NISQ era.

Abstract: A novel Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader type algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving general long-term constrained optimization problems in an online manner, where the target and constraint functions are oblivious adversarially generated and not necessarily convex. The algorithm is based on Lagrangian reformulation and innovatively integrates random perturbations and regularizations in primal and dual directions: 1). exponentially distributed random perturbations in the primal direction to handle non-convexity, and 2). strongly concave logarithmic regularizations in the dual space to handle constraint violations. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, and under mild Lipschitz continuity assumption, the algorithm demonstrates the online learnability, achieving the first sublinear cumulative regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic the human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnets better align artificial neural networks with human brain representations, making it more similar to human brain processing than traditional computer vision models, which takes an important step toward bridging the gap between artificial and human vision and achieving more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: PaECTER is an open-source document-level encoder specific for patents. We fine-tune BERT for Patents with examiner-added citation information to generate numerical representations for patent documents. PaECTER performs better in similarity tasks than current state-of-the-art models used in the patent domain. More specifically, our model outperforms the patent specific pre-trained language model (BERT for Patents) and general-purpose text embedding models (e.g., E5, GTE, and BGE) on our patent citation prediction test dataset on different rank evaluation metrics. PaECTER predicts at least one most similar patent at a rank of 1.32 on average when compared against 25 irrelevant patents. Numerical representations generated by PaECTER from patent text can be used for downstream tasks such as classification, tracing knowledge flows, or semantic similarity search. Semantic similarity search is especially relevant in the context of prior art search for both inventors and patent examiners.

Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.

Abstract: Attribution methods compute importance scores for input features to explain model predictions. However, assessing the faithfulness of these methods remains challenging due to the absence of attribution ground truth to model predictions. In this work, we first identify a set of fidelity criteria that reliable benchmarks for attribution methods are expected to fulfill, thereby facilitating a systematic assessment of attribution benchmarks. Next, we introduce a Backdoor-based eXplainable AI benchmark (BackX) that adheres to the desired fidelity criteria. We theoretically establish the superiority of our approach over the existing benchmarks for well-founded attribution evaluation. With extensive analysis, we further establish a standardized evaluation setup that mitigates confounding factors such as post-processing techniques and explained predictions, thereby ensuring a fair and consistent benchmarking. This setup is ultimately employed for a comprehensive comparison of existing methods using BackX. Finally, our analysis also offers insights into defending against neural Trojans by utilizing the attributions.

Abstract: Auctions are key for maximizing sellers' revenue and ensuring truthful bidding among buyers. Recently, an approach known as differentiable economics based on machine learning (ML) has shown promise in learning powerful auction mechanisms for multiple items and participants. However, this approach has no guarantee of strategy-proofness at test time. Strategy-proofness is crucial as it ensures that buyers are incentivized to bid their true valuations, leading to optimal and fair auction outcomes without the risk of manipulation. In this work, we propose a formulation of statistical strategy-proofness for auction mechanisms. Specifically, we offer a method that bounds the regret -- quantifying deviation from truthful bidding -- below a pre-specified level with high probability. Building upon conformal prediction techniques, we develop an auction acceptance rule that leverages regret predictions to guarantee that the data-driven auction mechanism meets the statistical strategy-proofness requirement with high probability. Our method -- Statistically Truthful Auctions via Acceptance Rule (STAR) -- represents a practical middle-ground between two extremes: enforcing truthfulness -- zero-regret -- at the cost of significant revenue loss, and naively using ML to construct auctions with the hope of attaining low regret, with no test-time guarantees.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that allows an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific naturally occurring trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors.We demonstrate our attacks on multiple open-source LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our attack on an end-to-end black-box production RAG system: NVIDIA's "Chat with RTX''.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) stands as one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide, necessitating advancements in diagnostic methodologies for better clinical outcomes. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to permeate the healthcare sector, particularly in oncology, the need for transparent and interpretable models becomes imperative to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care. This review discusses the integration of various XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and others, with machine learning and deep learning models utilized in breast cancer detection and classification. By investigating the modalities of breast cancer datasets, including mammograms, ultrasounds and their processing with AI, the paper highlights how XAI can lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. It also examines the challenges in implementing these techniques and the importance of developing standardized metrics for evaluating XAI's effectiveness in clinical settings. Through detailed analysis and discussion, this article aims to highlight the potential of XAI in bridging the gap between complex AI models and practical healthcare applications, thereby fostering trust and understanding among medical professionals and improving patient outcomes.

<title>UTrace: Poisoning Forensics for Private Collaborative Learning</title>

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) systems enable multiple data owners to collaboratively train models without revealing their raw, sensitive data by leveraging cryptographic protocols such as secure multi-party computation (MPC). While PPML offers strong privacy guarantees, it also introduces new attack surfaces: malicious data owners can inject poisoned data into the training process without being detected, thus undermining the integrity of the learned model. Although recent defenses, such as private input validation within MPC, can mitigate some specific poisoning strategies, they remain insufficient, particularly in preventing stealthy or distributed attacks. As the robustness of PPML remains an open challenge, strengthening trust in these systems increasingly necessitates post-hoc auditing mechanisms that instill accountability. In this paper we present UTrace, a framework for user-level traceback in PPML that attributes integrity failures to responsible data owners without compromising the privacy guarantees of MPC. UTrace encapsulates two mechanisms: a gradient similarity method that identifies suspicious update patterns linked to poisoning, and a user-level unlearning technique that quantifies each user's marginal influence on model behavior. Together, these methods allow UTrace to attribute model misbehavior to specific users with high precision. We implement UTrace within an MPC-compatible training and auditing pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness on four datasets spanning vision, text, and malware. Across ten canonical poisoning attacks, UTrace consistently achieves high detection accuracy with low false positive rates.

<title>A Likelihood Based Approach to Distribution Regression Using Conditional Deep Generative Models</title>

arXiv:2410.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the theoretical properties of conditional deep generative models under the statistical framework of distribution regression where the response variable lies in a high-dimensional ambient space but concentrates around a potentially lower-dimensional manifold. More specifically, we study the large-sample properties of a likelihood-based approach for estimating these models. Our results lead to the convergence rate of a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for estimating the conditional distribution (and its devolved counterpart) of the response given predictors in the Hellinger (Wasserstein) metric. Our rates depend solely on the intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the true conditional distribution. These findings provide an explanation of why conditional deep generative models can circumvent the curse of dimensionality from the perspective of statistical foundations and demonstrate that they can learn a broader class of nearly singular conditional distributions. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of introducing a small noise perturbation to the data when they are supported sufficiently close to a manifold. Finally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate the effective implementation of the proposed approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which also provide complementary validation to our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.

Abstract: Following their success in natural language processing (NLP), there has been a shift towards transformer models in computer vision. While transformers perform well and offer promising multi-tasking performance, due to their high compute requirements, many resource-constrained applications still rely on convolutional or hybrid models that combine the benefits of convolution and attention layers and achieve the best results in the sub 100M parameter range. Simultaneously, task adaptation techniques that allow for the use of one shared transformer backbone for multiple downstream tasks, resulting in great storage savings at negligible cost in performance, have not yet been adopted for hybrid transformers. In this work, we investigate how to achieve the best task-adaptation performance and introduce PETAH: Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation for Hybrid Transformers. We further combine PETAH adaptation with pruning to achieve highly performant and storage friendly models for multi-tasking. In our extensive evaluation on classification and other vision tasks, we demonstrate that our PETAH-adapted hybrid models outperform established task-adaptation techniques for ViTs while requiring fewer parameters and being more efficient on mobile hardware.

Abstract: Predicting electronic band structures from crystal structures is crucial for understanding structure-property correlations in materials science. First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation is a challenging task in digital communication. Despite significant progress in the area, most existing methods concentrate on audio-lip synchronization, often overlooking aspects such as visual quality, customization, and generalization that are crucial to producing realistic talking faces. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, customizable one-shot audio-driven talking face generation framework, named PortraitTalk. Our proposed method utilizes a latent diffusion framework consisting of two main components: IdentityNet and AnimateNet. IdentityNet is designed to preserve identity features consistently across the generated video frames, while AnimateNet aims to enhance temporal coherence and motion consistency. This framework also integrates an audio input with the reference images, thereby reducing the reliance on reference-style videos prevalent in existing approaches. A key innovation of PortraitTalk is the incorporation of text prompts through decoupled cross-attention mechanisms, which significantly expands creative control over the generated videos. Through extensive experiments, including a newly developed evaluation metric, our model demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for the generation of customizable realistic talking faces suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the renowned Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for directly estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Renyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most $2n+1$ with $n$ being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We prove that our loss function is operator-convex, ensuring that any local minimum is also a global minimum. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and observe the absence of the barren plateau phenomenon. As an application, we employ our algorithm to investigate the superadditivity of quantum channel capacity. Numerical simulations reveal new examples of qubit channels exhibiting strict superadditivity of coherent information, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning to address quantum-native problems.

Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.

Abstract: Calcium imaging allows for the parallel measurement of large neuronal populations in a spatially resolved and minimally invasive manner, and has become a gold-standard for neuronal functionality. While deep generative models have been successfully applied to study the activity of neuronal ensembles, their potential for learning single-neuron representations from calcium imaging fluorescence traces remains largely unexplored, and batch effects remain an important hurdle. To address this, we explore supervised variational autoencoder architectures that learn compact representations of individual neurons from fluorescent traces without relying on spike inference algorithms. We find that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, preserving biological variability while mitigating batch effects. Across simulated and experimental datasets, this framework enables robust visualization, clustering, and interpretation of single-neuron dynamics.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a practical and computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information of the model with respect to the parameters. Our approach consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance of the linear Gaussian model. This online covariance calibration stabilizes fitting and signals model inaccuracy. Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of mathematical content from natural language into machine-verifiable formal languages, has seen significant progress driven by advances in large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, a primary barrier to further improvements is the limited availability of parallel corpora that map informal mathematical text to its formal counterpart. To address this limitation, we propose ATLAS (Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data), a novel data generation framework designed to produce large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora of theorem statements. Distinct from prior approaches, ATLAS begins with a concept repository, accelerates the improvement of the student model through expert iteration combined with knowledge distillation, and introduces two novel augmentation strategies that exploit the structural characteristics of formal languages. Running the proposed ATLAS framework for 10 iterations, we construct an undergraduate-level dataset of 117k theorem statements and develop the ATLAS Translator by fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Instruct with LoRA. This model establishes a new state of the art, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over both the Herald Translator and the Kimina-Autoformalizer across all benchmarks (p<0.05, two-sided t-test). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the full-parameter fine-tuning of a stronger base model on the ATLAS dataset leads to superior performance. The datasets, model, and code are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/ATLAS.

Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.

Abstract: Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety. However, their adoption is currently hindered by their lower effective ionic conductivity, a quantity that governs charge and discharge rates. Identifying highly ion-conductive materials using conventional theoretical calculations and experimental validation is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. While machine learning holds the promise to expedite this process, relevant ionic conductivity and structural data is scarce. Here, we present OBELiX, a database of $\sim$600 synthesized solid electrolyte materials and their experimentally measured room temperature ionic conductivities gathered from literature and curated by domain experts. Each material is described by their measured composition, space group and lattice parameters. A full-crystal description in the form of a crystallographic information file (CIF) is provided for $\sim$320 structures for which atomic positions were available. We discuss various statistics and features of the dataset and provide training and testing splits carefully designed to avoid data leakage. Finally, we benchmark seven existing ML models on the task of predicting ionic conductivity and discuss their performance. The goal of this work is to facilitate the use of machine learning for solid-state electrolyte materials discovery.

Abstract: Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

<title>Toward a Robust R2D2 Paradigm for Radio-interferometric Imaging: Revisiting Deep Neural Network Training and Architecture</title>

Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalizability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. First, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomizing Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multiscan multinoise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Second, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Third, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense skip connections, weight normalization, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.

<title>Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers</title>

Abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method. We release our code at https://github.com/bhimanbaghel/ResolveUnderOverEdit.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to electroencephalography (EEG) has great potential to advance both neuroscientific research and clinical applications. However, the generalisability and robustness of EEG-based ML models often hinge on the amount and diversity of training data. It is common practice to split EEG recordings into small segments, thereby increasing the number of samples substantially compared to the number of individual recordings or participants. We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research. The code for our experiments is publicly available online.

Abstract: Deep learning has been reported to achieve high performances in the detection of skin cancer, yet many challenges regarding the reproducibility of results and biases remain. This study is a replication (different data, same analysis) of a previous study on Alzheimer's disease detection, which studied the robustness of logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) across patient sexes. We explore sex bias in skin cancer detection, using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset with LR trained on handcrafted features reflecting dermatological guidelines (ABCDE and the 7-point checklist), and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. We evaluate these models in alignment with the replicated study: across multiple training datasets with varied sex composition to determine their robustness. Our results show that both the LR and the CNN were robust to the sex distribution, but the results also revealed that the CNN had a significantly higher accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for male patients compared to female patients. The data and relevant scripts to reproduce our results are publicly available (https://github.com/ nikodice4/Skin-cancer-detection-sex-bias).

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

<title>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.

<title>Ambiguity in LLMs is a concept missing problem</title>

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

<title>EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible, and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task, Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences. To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.

arXiv:2506.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not faithfully reflect the original distances between clusters, practitioners frequently use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. We investigate why this misuse occurs, and discuss methods to prevent it. To that end, we first review 136 papers to verify the prevalence of the misuse. We then interview researchers who have used dimensionality reduction (DR) to understand why such misuse occurs. Finally, we interview DR experts to examine why previous efforts failed to address the misuse. We find that the misuse of t-SNE and UMAP stems primarily from limited DR literacy among practitioners, and that existing attempts to address this issue have been ineffective. Based on these insights, we discuss potential paths forward, including the controversial but pragmatic option of automating the selection of optimal DR projections to prevent misleading analyses.

Abstract: This study investigates minimax and Bayes optimal strategies in fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a sampling phase followed by a recommendation phase, and we design an adaptive experiment within this framework to efficiently identify the best arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our proposed strategy, the sampling phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, in which we allocate each arm uniformly in equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, arms are allocated in proportion to the variances estimated during the first stage. After the sampling phase, the procedure enters the recommendation phase, where we select the arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best arm. We prove that this single strategy is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that coincide exactly with our lower bounds, including the constant terms.

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques. Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO and RUOD datasets to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however, the success of these models is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language remains unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a step toward this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied to neurological imaging, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential. On two neurological MRI datasets, our framework simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis in 3D medical imaging. Project link - https://lesupermomo.github.io/imagining-alternatives/.

Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise trajectory tracking with quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that add degrees of freedom and hybrid dynamics. Classical model-based methods offer stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often fail to adapt when the configuration changes-when a payload is added or removed, or when its mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified learning-based control framework where a single reinforcement learning (RL) policy functions as an implicit hybrid controller, managing complex dynamics without explicit mode detection or controller switching. Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization across payload settings-including no payload as well as varying mass and cable length-without re-tuning, while retaining the interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller. Code and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/mintaeshkim/roverfly.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation: Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline, including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent, the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3. High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency. Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2% success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at https://github.com/csml-rpi/Foam-Agent.

<title>The Illusion of Readiness: Stress Testing Large Frontier Models on Multimodal Medical Benchmarks</title>

arXiv:2509.18234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AQuaMaM, a neural network designed to model complex distributions on the rotation manifold of SO(3) while efficiently calculating likelihoods in a single forward pass. AQuaMaM employs an autoregressive approach, modeling unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions to capture the intricate nature of rotation data. In experiments, AQuaMaM outperformed the implicit-PDF (IPDF) method in terms of test log-likelihood and efficiency, using fewer parameters and achieving a significantly faster prediction throughput. Training AQuaMaM on diverse datasets showed its ability to accurately capture the underlying distributions of rotation data, even in scenarios with ambiguous viewpoints. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of AQuaMaM in learning complex, multimodal distributions on the SO(3) group, making it a promising model for various applications requiring precise modeling of rotation data. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2301.08838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling complex, multimodal distributions for rotations in three-dimensions, i.e., the SO(3) group, is challenging due to the curvature of the rotation manifold. The recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective approach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision. However, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's final multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood that can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those without the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In this paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning complex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact likelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM autoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted domain of values. When trained on an "infinite" toy dataset with ambiguous viewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely matching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for IPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF approaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When trained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different rotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF. Further, compared to IPDF, AQuaMaM uses 24% fewer parameters, has a prediction throughput 52$\times$ faster on a single GPU, and converges in a similar amount of time during training.

<div> Keywords: anisotropy, singular value spectra, low-bit training, language models, quantization

Summary:
This work addresses the challenge of low-bit training for large language models (LLMs) by identifying anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as a key obstacle. The domination of these spectra by a small number of large singular values leads to quantization bias and spectral distortion, resulting in degraded training performance. The authors introduce Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions the anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for more effective quantization. By leveraging sparse random sampling and random projection within the dominant spectral subspace, Metis minimizes computational overhead while improving training performance. Specifically, on the LLaMA-3 8B dataset trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust training with W4A4G4 quantization, achieving similar fidelity to BF16 but with lower computational costs. Furthermore, Metis outperforms an implementation of Nvidia's FP4 recipe in terms of loss and downstream accuracy. The code implementation for Metis is available for reference.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as the fundamental barrier to low-bit training of large language models (LLMs). These spectra are dominated by a small fraction of large singular values, inducing wide numerical ranges that cause quantization bias and severe spectral distortion, ultimately degrading training performance. This work presents Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for independent quantization, thereby reducing errors and preserving spectral structure. To minimize overhead, Metis leverages two key properties of the dominant spectral subspace: preservation via sparsely random sampling and preservation via random projection, reducing decomposition cost to a negligible level. On LLaMA-3 8B trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust W4A4G4 training with FP4 quantization of weights, activations, and gradients, yielding only a 0.4% training loss gap and a 0.1% degradation in downstream accuracy relative to BF16. Beyond matching BF16 fidelity, Metis also surpasses our implementation of Nvidia's recently announced (yet to be publicly released) FP4 recipe, consistently achieving lower loss and higher downstream accuracy while incurring significantly lower computational overhead. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Metis-quantization-644B.

<div> Keywords: grokking, 2-layer nonlinear networks, lazy learning, feature learning, gradient dynamics

Summary:<br /><br />
The study delves into the phenomenon of grokking, focusing on the emergence of features in 2-layer nonlinear networks. It introduces a framework, titled $\mathbf{Li_2}$, which delineates three crucial stages: Lazy learning, Independent feature learning, and Interactive feature learning. Initially, the model engages in lazy learning, leading to the memorization of random hidden representations. Through backpropagated gradient $G_F, each hidden node autonomously learns its representation, following the gradient ascent of an energy function. The study investigates the generalizability and representation power of these emerging features in group arithmetic tasks and explores the impact of hyperparameters like weight decay and learning rate on grokking. Furthermore, it presents scaling laws for feature emergence, memorization, and generalizability, elucidating the effectiveness of recent optimizers. The analysis also hints at the extension of these findings to multi-layer architectures. <div>

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) \underline{\textbf{L}}azy learning, (II) \underline{\textbf{i}}ndependent feature learning and (III) \underline{\textbf{i}}nteractive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize. Thanks to lazy learning and weight decay, the \emph{backpropagated gradient} $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation \emph{independently}. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the \emph{gradient ascent} of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

<div> Keywords: Feature extraction, Medical image classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformer, Attention-based feature extractor

Summary: 
The proposed Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) aims to enhance feature extraction in medical image classification. MIAFEx utilizes a refinement mechanism within the Transformer encoder architecture to improve the extraction of salient features and adapt to challenges in medical imaging data. Compared to classical feature extractors, MIAFEx demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and robustness across various complex medical imaging datasets. Furthermore, MIAFEx outperforms modern CNN and Vision Transformer models, especially in scenarios with limited training data. The learnable refinement mechanism in MIAFEx allows for better generalization and adaptability, addressing the overfitting issues typically seen in traditional and modern models. This innovative approach showcases the potential for improving feature extraction techniques in medical image analysis. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

Regression models play a crucial role in recommender systems, but the retransformation bias problem is often overlooked in the field. Existing bias correction methods are often post-hoc solutions, posing challenges in real-world applications. This study proposes a preemptive approach to address bias intrinsically within models through minor refinements. The TranSUN method introduces joint bias learning, ensuring theoretically unbiased results with superior convergence. It is further expanded into the Generalized TranSUN (GTS) model family, offering theoretical insights and a flexible framework for developing bias-free models. Comprehensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of these methods across various data domains. The models have been successfully implemented in real-world industrial recommendation scenarios for product and short video recommendations on the Taobao App, a leading e-commerce platform. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.

Abstract: We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships. While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles. We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets, achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic insights.

Summary: 
Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS) is introduced as a lightweight optimization technique for enhancing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically adjusting token distributions based on recent logits' spectral and entropic properties. SLS maintains a buffer of top-K logits and applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, rescaling logits adaptively to sharpen output distributions only when uncertainty is high. This method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy in various tasks involving mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning on public benchmarks. SLS improves contextual consistency without updating model parameters, showcasing its effectiveness as a computational-efficient solution in refining LLM outputs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches, such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

arXiv:2509.25205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels. However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE, a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving graph representation learning.

Summary:
This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds, particularly focusing on the Poincaré ball. By extending the Hyperbolic Stochastic Gradient Descent to a Hyperbolic Adam optimizer, the study aims to improve learning on non-Euclidean surfaces. The optimization techniques are designed to facilitate the learning of Poincaré embeddings, enhancing convergence in the initial training phases when parameters are distant from the optimal values. Using hyperbolic time-discretization of Langevin dynamics, the researchers apply these methods to train diffusion models. The results demonstrate accelerated convergence on specific datasets without compromising generative quality. <div>

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing generative quality.

<div> Keywords: heavy rainfall forecasting, deep learning, long-tailed learning, DPSformer, early warning systems

Summary: 
Accurate forecasting of heavy rainfall events is crucial for societal preparedness, but current models struggle due to the imbalanced distribution of precipitation data. To address this challenge, a new model called DPSformer is introduced as a long-tail-aware approach to enhance representation of heavy rainfall events. By focusing on events with rainfall of 50 mm/6 h or more, the model significantly improves the Critical Success Index (CSI) compared to baseline models. Additionally, for the top 1% coverage of heavy rainfall events, DPSformer achieves a high Fraction Skill Score (FSS) surpassing existing methods. This work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to improve early warning systems and reduce the impacts of extreme weather events.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge, we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem, identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h, DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

<div> Keyword: Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting, Adaptive Regional Boundary Optimization, Dynamic Monthly Forecast Allocation, Spatial-Aligned Attention, Temporal Mixture-of-Experts

Summary:
Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast) is an AI-driven framework that optimizes regional boundaries and allocates dynamic monthly forecasts. It utilizes a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism to align global and regional spatial distributions, refining boundaries based on attention-derived patterns. The Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module routes atmospheric variables to specialized experts using a Gaussian distribution, enhancing temporal pattern capture. STCast excels in global and regional forecasting, extreme event prediction, and ensemble forecasting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in all tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.25210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting (STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns. Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a deep learning framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution constraints. LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios with bounded execution durations. The architecture decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions, using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs) and Variable Selection Networks (VSNs) to process market data. Independent allocation networks handle specific execution logic for different scenarios. LEMs achieve superior execution performance on intraday cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture allows deployment across different execution scenarios through a single framework, providing operational advantages over asset-specific approaches. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies, LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons, similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders). This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework, providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering, to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Summary: 
- Deploying large pre-trained models on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression techniques.
- Recent works combine quantization with high-precision LoRA adapters to reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.
- Edge devices have varying capabilities, making configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting computationally intensive.
- CoA-LoRA dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to different quantization configurations without repeated fine-tuning, improving efficiency.
- CoA-LoRA utilizes a Pareto-based configuration search to optimize the training configuration set, leading to precise low-rank adjustments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression. Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set, yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that, unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Summary: 
In the study, the researchers explore the phenomenon of double descent in machine learning, where there is a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold. They focus on predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. By varying model complexity along the axes of learner capacity and ensemble size, they find that double descent only consistently emerges when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, the generalization behavior reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. The results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, attributing double descent to the projection of distinct generalization regimes onto a single complexity axis. This highlights the importance of considering model complexity as a multidimensional construct in analyzing generalization behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work, we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity (e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour.

Summary:
Learning to condition (L2C) is a novel framework introduced for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in challenging Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). L2C trains a neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for conditioning, utilizing observed evidence. A scalable data generation pipeline is developed to extract training signals from existing MPE solvers' search traces. The trained network acts as a heuristic that can integrate with search algorithms, serving as a conditioning strategy before exact inference or as a policy within branch-and-bound solvers. Evaluation on high-treewidth PGMs demonstrates that the learned heuristic significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. L2C shows promise in improving MPE inference efficiency and effectiveness in complex graphical models.

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy. These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations. Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average inference time on the TinyML device.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4) an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates. This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

<div> prediction-correction, linear attention, long-range patterns, Residual Linear Attention, Residual Delta Net

Summary:
Residual Linear Attention (RLA) introduces a residual-fitting mechanism to linear attention, addressing the expressivity bottleneck by incorporating a recurrent state that accumulates residual errors over time for correction. Residual Delta Net (RDN) is a delta-rule version of RLA that incorporates adaptive gating and residual clipping for improved correction control and stability. Both RLA and RDN outperform their respective baselines and other linear-attention methods, narrowing the performance gap to standard Transformers while maintaining linear time and memory efficiency. The implementation leverages optimized linear attention kernels and excels in language modeling and recall-intensive tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.25223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net (RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

<div> Keyword: Multi-head Latent Attention, KVCache, Ascend MLA, FlashAttention, FLOPS utilization <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a kernel optimized for Huawei's Ascend NPUs, to reduce memory usage in Large Language Models. AMLA uses a FlashAttention-based algorithm and a Preload Pipeline strategy with hierarchical tiling to improve performance. The algorithm replaces floating-point multiplications with integer additions, achieving a significant reduction in computational overhead. The Preload Pipeline strategy maximizes FLOPS utilization, reaching up to 86.8% of the theoretical maximum on Ascend 910 NPUs. In comparison, the state-of-the-art FlashMLA implementation on NVIDIA H800 SXM5 achieves FLOPS utilization of only 66.7%. AMLA outperforms the open-source implementation and has been integrated into Huawei's CANN for release. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS, reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Summary:
The article introduces MSCoD, a novel framework for Structure-Based Drug Design that addresses the limitations of current methods by incorporating a Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck for hierarchical feature extraction and a multi-head cooperative attention mechanism for capturing diverse interaction types. Empirical studies demonstrate that MSCoD outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets and is applicable to challenging targets like KRAS G12D.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios.

<div> marine energy systems, wind, solar, wave, forecasting, MVMD-LSTM <br />
Summary: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems offer a promising solution for clean electricity generation. A new forecasting framework, MVMD-LSTM, addresses the challenge of accurately predicting power output by considering the interactions among wind, solar, and wave energy sources. The framework combines Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to decompose the energy series, Bayesian optimization to optimize the process, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for forecasting. Experiments using field data from an integrated energy platform in China demonstrate the framework's superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy, robustness, and automation level, surpassing traditional forecasting models. The MVMD-LSTM framework shows potential for enhancing power-generation efficiency and resource utilization in integrated marine energy systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs, thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source, insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies, struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system. Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Summary:
Random Projection Flows (RPFs) are introduced as a framework for injective normalizing flows. They utilize random semi-orthogonal matrices from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles, allowing for efficient projection of data into lower-dimensional latent spaces. Unlike other methods, RPFs are plug-and-play, providing closed-form expressions for the Riemannian volume correction term. The approach is both theoretically grounded and practically effective, serving as a strong baseline for generative modeling. RPFs bridge random projection theory with normalizing flows, showcasing the potential of leveraging random projection techniques in the context of generative modeling. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and normalizing flows.

The paper introduces a new method for learning temporal data trajectories by incorporating the inductive bias that trajectories should remain close to the underlying data manifold. Traditional flow matching methods rely on straight paths, while geodesic-based methods use RBF kernels or nearest neighbor graphs which can suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The proposed approach employs score matching and annealed energy distillation to learn a metric tensor that accurately captures the underlying data geometry and improves flow accuracy. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, as well as in cell interpolation tasks. <div>

<br />
Summary: <br /> Time series forecasting is crucial in various applications, but traditional models may struggle with sparse data. The WDformer model proposed in this study utilizes wavelet transform for multi-resolution analysis of time series data, allowing for extraction of key information components across time-frequency domains. By implementing attention mechanisms on inverted dimensions and using a differential attention mechanism to focus on important information while reducing noise, WDformer achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets. The model's ability to capture relationships between multiple variables and accurately extract essential data characteristics makes it a promising tool for accurate and effective time series forecasting tasks. The code for WDformer is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain, it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.

Summary: 
The article introduces a family of Gaussian Mixture Approximation (GMA) samplers for sampling unnormalised target densities. This includes Weight-Only GMA, Laplace Mixture Approximation, and Expectation-Maximization GMA among other variants. The GMA method involves a two-stage process: initializing a set of Gaussian components and sampling from a proposal mixture, then fitting the mixture to the target by optimizing component weights, means, and variances through a sample-based KL divergence objective. The method is gradient-free and computationally efficient, utilizing sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimization methods, and robust stratified resampling. Consistent approximations are achieved under mild conditions, demonstrated with empirical results showcasing accuracy and speed across various densities. <div>

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA), \textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e., FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity. Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score for several failure mechanisms.

Summary:
The proposed PALADIN framework aims to enhance language agents' resilience to tool malfunctions by training them on failure recovery strategies. Through the use of 50,000+ annotated trajectories and fine-tuning with LoRA, PALADIN is able to detect errors at runtime and execute appropriate recovery actions. The framework is capable of generalizing to new failure scenarios, achieving a high recovery performance of 95.2% on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation against baseline models shows significant improvements in Recovery Rate, Task Success Rate, Catastrophic Success Rate, and Efficiency Score. PALADIN outperforms existing methods, such as CRITIC, and vanilla agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling fault-tolerant agents for real-world tool environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose \textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+ recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution, retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR), and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57% relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%) by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in real-world tool environments.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering. However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics, commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal. This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs, enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&amp;A) tasks while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&amp;A dataset. Our results demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&amp;A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains. Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Summary:<br />
Knowledge distillation is a common method for transferring knowledge from larger models to smaller ones. Traditional distillation techniques use probabilistic divergence, while feature-based methods focus on mimicking the feature space of the teacher model. However, existing feature distillation methods, such as mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment, may not effectively capture the feature structure. To address this, Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix are proposed as distillation losses. By integrating feature geometry into distillation methods, significant improvement in distillation performance for language models like BERT and OPT is observed, with gains of up to 2 percentage points in tasks like classification and instruction-following. This highlights the potential of incorporating feature geometry in improving knowledge distillation techniques. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.

<div> reinforcement learning, language models, prompt policy network, adaptive strategy selection, efficiency-accuracy trade-off

Summary:
Prompt Policy Network (PPN) is introduced as a lightweight reinforcement learning framework to optimize the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by adaptively selecting prompting strategies. The PPN operates as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a resource-explicit reward function. By learning to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary, PPN achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks. Compared to static approaches like Self-Consistency, PPN can reduce token costs by up to 61.5% while maintaining competitive accuracy. This framework provides a systematic and adaptive solution for cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the development of lightweight optimization techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs. This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function, learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Summary:<br />
Weather foundation models, such as Silurian AI's Generative Forecasting Transformer, show promise in enhancing global forecast accuracy. In this study, the model was fine-tuned using Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations to provide hyper-local forecasts for critical grid variables. The tailored model outperformed existing benchmarks, reducing errors in temperature, precipitation, and wind speed predictions. Most notably, it achieved a high precision score for detecting rime-ice, offering valuable warning time for outage prevention. These findings demonstrate the practical application of post-training WFMs with high-fidelity data for enhancing grid resilience intelligence. <div>

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE) by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%. Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems, which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

<div> contrastive synergistic information extraction, InfMasking, multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions, mutual information maximization

Summary:<br />
- InfMasking is introduced as a contrastive synergistic information extraction method for multimodal representation learning to enhance interactions between modalities. 
- The method employs an Infinite Masking strategy to occlude most features during fusion, preserving partial information to create varied synergistic patterns.
- By aligning unmasked fused representations with masked ones through mutual information maximization, comprehensive synergistic information is encoded.
- InfMasking leverages diverse partial modality combinations during training to capture richer interactions.
- The accompanying InfMasking loss approximates mutual information calculation to handle the computational complexity.
- Through experiments, InfMasking is shown to effectively enhance synergistic information and achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2509.25270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

<div> framework, MAESTRO, multimodal learning, sensor monitoring, time series <br />
<br />Summary:
The article introduces MAESTRO, a novel framework for multimodal learning in real-world intelligent decision-making scenarios. MAESTRO addresses key limitations of existing approaches by enabling dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance. It leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to process long multimodal sequences with sparse cross-modal attention. The framework uses a sparse Mixture-of-Experts mechanism for black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. Evaluation against 10 baselines on diverse datasets shows an average 4% and 8% improvement over existing approaches under complete observations. With up to 40% missing modalities, MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. The analysis demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series data. <div>
arXiv:2509.25278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Summary: 
The ClustRecNet framework is introduced for selecting clustering algorithms in unsupervised learning, utilizing a dataset repository with synthetic data and ground truth labels. The deep learning model integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture structural patterns, enabling end-to-end training and direct algorithm recommendations. Experimental results show superior performance compared to conventional cluster validity indices and state-of-the-art AutoML approaches, with significant improvements in ARI scores on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The model outperforms the Calinski-Harabasz index by 0.497 ARI on synthetic data and achieves a 15.3% ARI gain over the best AutoML approach on real-world data. <div>
arXiv:2509.25289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on real-world data.

<div> scaling laws, large language models, reinforcement learning, post-training, mathematical reasoning 

Summary: 
Under a fixed computational budget, larger language models trained for shorter periods outperform smaller models trained for longer durations. Larger models exhibit superior sample efficiency with a fixed amount of training data, resulting in lower loss. Repeatedly using high-quality data proves effective in data-constrained scenarios, where final performance is influenced more by the total number of optimization steps rather than sample uniqueness. Both base and instruction-tuned models display similar learning dynamics, with larger models showing faster convergence despite differing in accuracy. These findings offer a structured basis and practical recommendations for effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models through reinforcement learning post-training.

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL) post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget, larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Summary: 
The article introduces LEO-CVAE, a novel generative oversampling framework designed to address class imbalance in high-dimensional biomedical data with complex nonlinear structures. Traditional oversampling methods like SMOTE often produce unrealistic synthetic samples due to their reliance on linear interpolation. On the other hand, deep generative models such as CVAEs capture nonlinear distributions better but fail to account for the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples. LEO-CVAE incorporates local uncertainty into representation learning and data generation by quantifying uncertainty through Shannon entropy. It utilizes a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss to focus on learning in uncertain regions and an entropy-guided sampling strategy to generate samples in informative, class-overlapping areas. When applied to clinical genomics datasets, LEO-CVAE consistently outperforms traditional oversampling and generative baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling in addressing class imbalance in complex biomedical data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate. Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Summary:<br />
The article investigates the behavior of gradient descent in matrix factorization and reveals that with large step sizes, the parameter space undergoes a fractal transformation. The study determines the critical step size required for convergence in scalar-vector factorization, showcasing the significant impact of initialization on the chosen minimizer near the critical point. Additionally, the inclusion of regularization intensifies this sensitivity, leading to the emergence of a fractal boundary that separates convergent and divergent initializations. The analysis extends to orthogonal initialization in general matrix factorization. Interestingly, the research identifies a chaotic phase of gradient descent near critical step sizes, where long-term dynamics become unpredictable, and there are no evident implicit biases, such as preferences for balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases, such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

In the study of active correlation clustering, where pairwise similarities are not initially provided, a cost-efficient approach through active learning is proposed. The focus is on the cold-start scenario, where true initial pairwise similarities are unavailable for active learning. To tackle this challenge, a coverage-aware method is introduced to promote diversity early in the process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through various synthetic and real-world experiments. The research aims to optimize the process of clustering by efficiently querying pairwise similarities through active learning, particularly in scenarios where initial information is lacking. <div>

Protein structure prediction and folding are crucial for understanding biology, with recent deep learning advancements reshaping the field. This study introduces a physically motivated non-linear noising process grounded in classical physics to unfold proteins into secondary structures while preserving topological integrity. By integrating this process with the flow-matching paradigm on SE(3), the model can accurately model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with high fidelity. The method enables sequence-conditioned folding, expanding the generative capabilities of the model and achieving state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation. The experimental results demonstrate the production of more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer sequences into precise protein conformations. <div>

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field. Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics, that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer sequences into precise protein conformations.

Summary: 
Data curriculums are crucial for effective LLM training, but the best way to place data remains unclear. This study introduces the training re-evaluation curve (TREC), a tool that evaluates training batches using final model weights. It shows how well a model retains training data based on when the data was encountered during training. The analysis of models with varying parameters reveals that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC improves performance. The TREC, initially visible only post-training, can be predicted in advance using AdamW's EMA coefficients, aiding proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for existing training methods, this study explains previous results and identifies suboptimal data placements. Adjusting data placement based on TREC minima enhances continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on a large token dataset. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the *training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of *when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be *predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Summary: 
This work examines a denoising variational autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior trained on gravitational wave data from event GW150914. The study focuses on assessing the model's ability to capture underlying structures by using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to draw posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs. Despite accurately reconstructing signals, a discrepancy is found in the latent space when comparing samples from noisy data to the encoder's outputs. This indicates that while the model exhibits strong denoising performance, the latent representations may not be reliable. The study emphasizes the importance of utilizing posterior-based validation methods to evaluate generative models effectively. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that combines predictions from various model-based clustering algorithms by adapting the Dawid-Skene model. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing relying on human labels, mixsemble treats clustering algorithm outputs as noisy annotations. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets demonstrate mixsemble's robustness, consistently approaching top performance while avoiding poor outcomes. This stability makes mixsemble a practical choice when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-experts. The framework's adaptability and ability to handle uncertain data structures make it a valuable tool in clustering tasks, providing reliable results even in complex scenarios. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert users.

Summary:
- Equation discovery using Bayesian relevance vector machines (RVM) is a grey-box approach to system identification.
- Models often overfit to specific datasets, posing a challenge for generalization across different operating conditions.
- A multi-task learning (MTL) framework with RVM is proposed for parameter identification across multiple datasets.
- MTL-RVM improves parameter recovery for datasets with weak and moderate excitations, enhancing generalization.
- This approach is beneficial for structural health monitoring, where varying load conditions provide complementary insights into system physics. <br /> <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM) within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast, the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of system physics.

Summary: <br />
Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have impressive visual synthesis capabilities but face computational constraints. In response, sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed, with varied patterns requiring custom kernels. FlashOmni, a unified sparse attention engine, introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize sparsity strategies like feature caching and block-sparse skipping. By designing optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, FlashOmni enables diverse sparse computations within a single kernel, achieving near-linear speedup in attention and GEMM-Q. Experimental results show FlashOmni can accelerate GEMM-O by 2.5-3.8 times, nearing the theoretical limit. When applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, FlashOmni accelerates the Hunyuan model by about 1.5 times without compromising visual quality. <div>

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves 2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end acceleration without degrading visual quality.

<div> asymmetric multi-LoRA, knowledge encoding, transfer, Fed-ALoRA, federated fine-tuning 

Summary:
ALoRA investigates the phenomenon of similarity in inner matrices during training of large language models and finds it is due to identical initialization. It proposes an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple A matrices and a shared B for multi-task fine-tuning. Fed-ALoRA is introduced for federated fine-tuning, sharing B across clients using a novel matrix decomposition strategy to handle varying ranks. Experiments across tasks show more balanced performance and comparable or better accuracy than existing multi-LoRA methods. The code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$ is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches.

<title>Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Strategic High-Impact Assaults</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25418</link>

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks, communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic, easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection (to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT) demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal dynamics.

<title>Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies, trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective. Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2) modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations. Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54% compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

<title>Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring</title>

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM). During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari. Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see https://github.com/Akuna23Matata/LPM_exploration

<title>Norm-Q: Effective Compression Method for Hidden Markov Models in Neuro-Symbolic Applications</title>

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3 bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at https://github.com/superstarghy/Norm-Q.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on Joint Embedding.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real robot without using real data.

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations. Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases (VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%, 43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size, scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated, closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a 20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90 nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations, demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and threshold voltages.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise, real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

<title>Flow Matching with Semidiscrete Couplings</title>

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points $(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned, on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT) solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly, which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle. Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring $O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

<title>Meta-Router: Bridging Gold-standard and Preference-based Evaluations in Large Language Model Routing</title>

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model (LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off between cost and quality.

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces. We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604 high-performing candidates.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However, state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded, and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and robust FL in real-world deployments.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates. In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes. In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function. We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e., budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more conservatively.

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure. Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO, yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO), zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO), distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt), diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution (Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD), policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for real-world optimization.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However, we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an ineliminable property of neural activations.

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic, parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s. We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to meet specific sparsity requirements.

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution. Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence. Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually labeled fault data.

<title>Layer-wise dynamic rank for compressing large language models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank, a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40% compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential. To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75 days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from medium-range to seasonal-scales.

<title>How Does Preconditioning Guide Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks?</title>

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and generalization performance. We first show that the input information available to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model, we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is aligned with that of the teacher.

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy. Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models, respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to high-dimensional input problems.

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance. Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic sparsity.

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are "unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer. Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training, even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase. These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples, we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated, avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model. Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has converged.

Abstract: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated novel approach to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a motor imagery right-left-hand movement mechanism for control. The system is designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on motor imagery right and left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered dataset, obtained from an open-source EEG repository, was segmented into arrays of 19x200 to capture the onset of hand movements. The data was acquired at a sampling frequency of 200Hz. The system integrates a Tkinter-based interface for simulating wheelchair movements, offering users a functional and intuitive control system. We propose a BiLSTM-BiGRU model that shows a superior test accuracy of 92.26% as compared with various machine learning baseline models, including XGBoost, EEGNet, and a transformer-based model. The Bi-LSTM-BiGRU attention-based model achieved a mean accuracy of 90.13% through cross-validation, showcasing the potential of attention mechanisms in BCI applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and improved interpretability.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers, consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation. Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal computations driving model decisions.

<title>A Unified Probabilistic Framework for Dictionary Learning with Parsimonious Activation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25690</link>

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE) and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage, a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/tingyushi/CPATTA.

<title>Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?</title>

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many existing approaches is limited by the lack of fu- ture predictions and consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements. During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

<title>Adaptive Graph Coarsening for Efficient GNN Training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular, we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task during training.

<title>Expert Merging: Model Merging with Unsupervised Expert Alignment and Importance-Guided Layer Chunking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25712</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines, with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even exceeding supervised Mixture Training.

<title>Reweighted Flow Matching via Unbalanced OT for Label-free Long-tailed Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25713</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels. By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k > 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

<title>MuPlon: Multi-Path Causal Optimization for Claim Verification through Controlling Confounding</title>

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless, claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization (MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes. In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations. We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss metric.

arXiv:2509.25727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry: return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go (CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region. Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38 safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime operations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

arXiv:2509.25743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data. However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore, we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests, effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

<title>OPPO: Accelerating PPO-based RLHF via Pipeline Overlap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g., reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel, lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g., actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g., reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2) Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4 \times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

<title>Autonomy-Aware Clustering: When Local Decisions Supersede Global Prescriptions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

arXiv:2509.25777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones, further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action spaces.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds. We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk. The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant, physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns, allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence, represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent confounders.

Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate an ensemble machine learning-based framework for the automatic detection of Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia (WCT) from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques, i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of 94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics. SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model. Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance, with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones, and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models. Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

<title>Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

<title>Decentralized Asynchronous Multi-player Bandits</title>

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times, and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$, where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals. However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge, thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines in addressing modality imbalance.

<title>Distillation of Large Language Models via Concrete Score Matching</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference. Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B, OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

<title>S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy Decision Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability of the selected features.

<title>Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning, where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions. However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and "cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal. Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$, highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

arXiv:2509.25876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity, we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

arXiv:2509.25906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss, demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is available at: .

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy, including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics. Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks. We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes. Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii) Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2) exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks; and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study, we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training, we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that, similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions, we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings, including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation and applications in Mean-Field Games.

<title>CAST: Continuous and Differentiable Semi-Structured Sparsity-Aware Training for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25996</link>

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M") sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training, while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format. Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns; 3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally, we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

<title>Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic: Leveraging Privileged Signals Beyond Full-State Access</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are both practical and theoretically sound.

<title>Indirect Attention: Turning Context Misalignment into a Feature</title>

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context (key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

<title>Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26030</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

<title>Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification</title>

arXiv:2509.26032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient.

<title>Real-time Noise Detection and Classification in Single-Channel EEG: A Lightweight Machine Learning Approach for EMG, White Noise, and EOG Artifacts</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

<title>Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy, while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

<title>UncertainGen: Uncertainty-Aware Representations of DNA Sequences for Metagenomic Binning</title>

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach, UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for large-scale metagenomic analysis.

<title>Domain-Aware Hyperdimensional Computing for Edge Smart Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically, signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than 40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation, especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting. As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way. By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference. Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically, AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities. Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell) is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish (i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$, our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training, leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce **T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation, explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct ** append, to reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling, and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0% accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.

<title>Beyond Linear Probes: Dynamic Safety Monitoring for Language Models</title>

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at http://github.com/james-oldfield/tpc.

<title>Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of frontier model evaluations.

<title>From Fragile to Certified: Wasserstein Audits of Group Fairness Under Distribution Shift</title>

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF) as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers, $\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness beyond observational data.

<title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization Through the Lens of Structural Causal Models and Individual Fairness</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust learning.

<title>Reframing Generative Models for Physical Systems using Stochastic Interpolants</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26282</link>

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical. We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures, incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/lionelblonde/ngt-pytorch.

<title>Tuning the Tuner: Introducing Hyperparameter Optimization for Auto-Tuning</title>

arXiv:2509.26300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields, hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data, lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by 94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of 204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

<title>NeuroTTT: Bridging Pretraining-Downstream Task Misalignment in EEG Foundation Models via Test-Time Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26301</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks, as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives, aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and adaptation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/wsl2000/NeuroTTT.

arXiv:2509.26307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding (AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive, entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain. Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning, multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

<title>ACE: Adapting sampling for Counterfactual Explanations</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier. Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable changes.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning. We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately. Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge. However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

<title>LLM-Assisted Emergency Triage Benchmark: Bridging Hospital-Rich and MCI-Like Field Simulation</title>

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers, transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and (ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes. Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by (i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii) prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses, illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities, with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method.

arXiv:2509.26405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution. Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off. However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing. Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free, plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.

<title>Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first $L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates. Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates. Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline models, and identify promising directions for future research.

arXiv:2509.26469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion, keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over alternative quantization approaches.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm, preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

<title>Entropy After $\langle \texttt{/Think} \rangle$ for reasoning model early exiting</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After  (EAT) -- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a stop thinking token () and monitoring the entropy of the following token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT is computed with proxy models.

<title>TAP: Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization of Multi-task and Multi-Modal Foundation Models in Federated Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.26524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client. While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14 Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency, restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp modeler.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment strategies.

<title>Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome. Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling, the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison. Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit annotations.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly, building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS, logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting reliable UQ measures.

arXiv:2509.26625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone, surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains -- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning approach yields significant performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL (PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL. However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency, both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation, orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000 videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard). Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed. However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets, which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

<title>AdaptCache: KV Cache Native Storage Hierarchy for Low-Delay and High-Quality Language Model Serving</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems, their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses, focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools. Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload, strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors, improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with practitioners needs.

<title>APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR): APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

<title>Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI</title>

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models (SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN, including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast, Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/kevin671/cot-vs-loop.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) configurations for financial fraud detection, encompassing three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns, circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with ZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns, achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security applications.

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering, speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric. Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can affect the performance of the model on any given task.

<title>RANGER -- Repository-Level Agent for Graph-Enhanced Retrieval</title>

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities, or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository, capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level, and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval, pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code completion compared to other RAG methods.

<title>Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective</title>

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning, that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<title>From NL2SQL to NL2GeoSQL: GeoSQL-Eval for automated evaluation of LLMs on PostGIS queries</title>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation (NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions, geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation, leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions, and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns. Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban studies, and spatial analysis.

<title>Evaluating the Impact of Radiographic Noise on Chest X-ray Semantic Segmentation and Disease Classification Using a Scalable Noise Injection Framework</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum (Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel, scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843), signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform. We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam, the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated, simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior, one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

Abstract: Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads, inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/MatterMech}{GitHub}.

Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

<title>Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication Risk in LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical deployment of LLM agents.

Abstract: We implement physics-informed-neural-networks (PINNs) to compute holographic entanglement entropy and entanglement wedge cross section. This technique allows us to compute these quantities for arbitrary shapes of the subregions in any asymptotically AdS metric. We test our computations against some known results and further demonstrate the utility of PINNs in examples, where it is not straightforward to perform such computations.

<title>VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes</title>

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA) benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple, knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes. Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better models.

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a foundation for future work in this area.

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However, the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further. We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks, leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

<title>From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409</link>

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.

<title>Boolean Satisfiability via Imitation Learning</title>

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions. Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration, yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection. Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR (Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable, and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item response model from model responses with different budgets to different queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration (SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1, RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification approaches.

Abstract: We propose a framework for conditional vector quantile regression (CVQR) that combines neural optimal transport with amortized optimization, and apply it to multivariate conformal prediction. Classical quantile regression does not extend naturally to multivariate responses, while existing approaches often ignore the geometry of joint distributions. Our method parametrizes the conditional vector quantile function as the gradient of a convex potential implemented by an input-convex neural network, ensuring monotonicity and uniform ranks. To reduce the cost of solving high-dimensional variational problems, we introduced amortized optimization of the dual potentials, yielding efficient training and faster inference. We then exploit the induced multivariate ranks for conformal prediction, constructing distribution-free predictive regions with finite-sample validity. Unlike coordinatewise methods, our approach adapts to the geometry of the conditional distribution, producing tighter and more informative regions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved coverage-efficiency trade-offs compared to baselines, highlighting the benefits of integrating neural optimal transport with conformal prediction.

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PIPer.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems. They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source, lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$ and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as $\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a $\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as well as with complex models in DRL.

Abstract: We develop new classifiers under group fairness in the attribute-aware setting for binary classification with multiple group fairness constraints (e.g., demographic parity (DP), equalized odds (EO), and predictive parity (PP)). We propose a novel approach, applicable to linear fractional constraints, based on directly intervening on the operating characteristics of a pre-trained base classifier, by (i) identifying optimal operating characteristics using the base classifier's group-wise ROC convex hulls and (ii) post-processing the base classifier to match those targets. As practical post-processors, we consider randomizing a mixture of group-wise thresholding rules subject to minimizing the expected number of interventions. We further extend our approach to handle multiple protected attributes and multiple linear fractional constraints. On standard datasets (COMPAS and ACSIncome), our methods simultaneously satisfy approximate DP, EO, and PP with few interventions and a near-oracle drop in accuracy; comparing favorably to previous methods.

Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.

Abstract: The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.

Abstract: How can we generate samples from a conditional distribution that we never fully observe? This question arises across a broad range of applications in both modern machine learning and classical statistics, including image post-processing in computer vision, approximate posterior sampling in simulation-based inference, and conditional distribution modeling in complex data settings. In such settings, compared with unconditional sampling, additional feature information can be leveraged to enable more adaptive and efficient sampling. Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple, adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity. We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on practical applications such as image denoising and image super-resolution.

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate consistent function representations across architectures, vital for \textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and reasoning over diverse modalities, but their advanced abilities also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. While relevant research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.

Abstract: As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education, there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79 middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers, and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and feedback design.

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at 130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training. Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks. These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines. Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances performance for less capable models.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net, leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy, reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images, outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%, respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive data in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key limitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while SL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed Learning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance, and security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks: Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning (BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by distributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across multiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized server with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven consensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an evaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby mitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations against baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and scalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior performance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge, BSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end decentralized SplitFed Learning system.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined. Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%), outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding more robust model development.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.

Abstract: In binary classification applications, conservative decision-making that allows for abstention can be advantageous. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that determines the optimal cutoff interval for risk scores, which can be directly available or derived from fitted models. Within this interval, the algorithm refrains from making decisions, while outside the interval, classification accuracy is maximized. Our approach is inspired by support vector machines (SVM), but differs in that it minimizes the classification margin rather than maximizing it. We provide the theoretical optimal solution to this problem, which holds important practical implications. Our proposed method not only supports conservative decision-making but also inherently results in a risk-coverage curve. Together with the area under the curve (AUC), this curve can serve as a comprehensive performance metric for evaluating and comparing classifiers, akin to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. To investigate and illustrate our approach, we conduct both simulation studies and a real-world case study in the context of diagnosing prostate cancer.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with significantly reduced resource requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback, which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without "golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: We consider inferring the causal effect of a treatment (intervention) on an outcome of interest in situations where there is potentially an unobserved confounder influencing both the treatment and the outcome. This is achievable by assuming access to two separate sets of control (proxy) measurements associated with treatment and outcomes, which are used to estimate treatment effects through a function termed the em causal bridge (CB). We present a new theoretical perspective, associated assumptions for when estimating treatment effects with the CB is feasible, and a bound on the average error of the treatment effect when the CB assumptions are violated. From this new perspective, we then demonstrate how coupling the CB with an autoencoder architecture allows for the sharing of statistical strength between observed quantities (proxies, treatment, and outcomes), thus improving the quality of the CB estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in relation to the state-of-the-art methodology for proxy measurements.

<title>RFG: Test-Time Scaling for Diffusion Large Language Model Reasoning with Reward-Free Guidance</title>

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models.

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from complex and high dimensional target distributions turns out to be a fundamental task in diverse disciplines such as scientific computing, statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we revisit the randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures. Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.

<title>Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Precoding for Multi-RIS-Aided Multiuser Downlink Systems with Practical Phase Shift</title>

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3 from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

<title>Importance Sampling for Multi-Negative Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning.

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3. These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays, our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

<title>Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory</title>

Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this promising direction.

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable, high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text generation in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper, we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time. We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models $y=\sigma_*(\langle \beta, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$, where the feature vector $\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector $\beta$ and the link function $\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width grow.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope. Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation and foster supportive online communities.

<title>SAC Flow: Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Flow-Based Policies via Velocity-Reparameterized Sequential Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection: the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm, enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage. This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than \$13 million annual cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation, Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning: Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages, offering valuable insights for future research and development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to interact with unstructured content. As such, LLMs are now a key driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents. Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while maintaining high utility.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt. The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance; we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion systems.

Abstract: We present a system that enables real-time interaction between human users and agents trained to control fighter jets in simulated 3D air combat scenarios. The agents are trained in a dedicated environment using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. A communication link is developed to allow seamless deployment of trained agents into VR-Forces, a widely used defense simulation tool for realistic tactical scenarios. This integration allows mixed simulations where human-controlled entities engage with intelligent agents exhibiting distinct combat behaviors. Our interaction model creates new opportunities for human-agent teaming, immersive training, and the exploration of innovative tactics in defense contexts.

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer. These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip) connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is $\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

Abstract: We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment. This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available at \href{https://github.com/christti98/semobridge}{github.com/christti98/semobridge}.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations, including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction. CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its excellent generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique, ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models (LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical, functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

<title>Efficient Distributed Training via Dual Batch Sizes and Cyclic Progressive Learning</title>

Abstract: Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time. Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning, we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model, which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally, the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with reduced overlap.

Abstract: A central challenge in understanding generalization is to obtain non-vacuous guarantees that go beyond worst-case complexity over data or weight space. Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayes bounds stand out as they can provide tight, data-dependent guarantees even for large networks. However, in ReLU networks, rescaling invariances mean that different weight distributions can represent the same function while leading to arbitrarily different PAC-Bayes complexities. We propose to study PAC-Bayes bounds in an invariant, lifted representation that resolves this discrepancy. This paper explores both the guarantees provided by this approach (invariance, tighter bounds via data processing) and the algorithmic aspects of KL-based rescaling-invariant PAC-Bayes bounds.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting, with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: Speaker diarization is the task of partitioning audio into segments according to speaker identity, answering the question of "who spoke when" in multi-speaker conversation recordings. While diarization is an essential task for many downstream applications, it remains an unsolved problem. Errors in diarization propagate to downstream systems and cause wide-ranging failures. To this end, we examine exact failure modes by evaluating five state-of-the-art diarization models, across four diarization datasets spanning multiple languages and acoustic conditions. The evaluation datasets consist of 196.6 hours of multilingual audio, including English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, and Spanish. Overall, we find that PyannoteAI achieves the best performance at 11.2% DER, while DiariZen provides a competitive open-source alternative at 13.3% DER. When analyzing failure cases, we find that the primary cause of diarization errors stem from missed speech segments followed by speaker confusion, especially in high-speaker count settings.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute labels.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images: one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using the natural invariance of images to translations.

We propose a novel pruning technique targeted explicitly at the attention mechanism, where we decouple the pruning of the four layers in the attention block, namely: query, keys, values and outputs' projection matrices. We also investigate pruning strategies to prune along the head and channel dimensions, and compare the performance of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model under different pruning scenarios. Our results show that even by pruning 50\% of the attention parameters we incur in performance degradation of less than 1\%

Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a quintessential NP-hard combinatorial optimisation challenge, is vital for logistics and network design but limited by exponential complexity in large instances. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework integrating variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimisation with classical machine learning, using K-means clustering for problem decomposition and a RandomForestRegressor for path refinement. Evaluated on 80 European cities (from 4 to 80 cities, 38,500 samples in total) via Qiskit's AerSimulator and ibm_kyiv 127-qubit backend, the hybrid approach outperforms quantum-only methods, achieving an approximation ratio of 1.0287 at 80 cities, a 47.5% improvement over quantum-only's 1.9614, nearing the classical baseline. Machine learning reduces variability in tour distances (interquartile range, IQR - the spread of the middle 50% of results relative to the median - from 0.06 to 0.04), enhancing stability despite noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) noise. This framework underscores hybrid strategies' potential for scalable TSP optimisation, with future hardware advancements promising practical quantum advantages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning representations in condensed matter physics.

<title>PRPO: Paragraph-level Policy Optimization for Vision-Language Deepfake Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level. Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake detection.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and (iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

Abstract: Data quality issues such as off-topic samples, near duplicates, and label errors often limit the performance of audio-based systems. This paper addresses these issues by adapting SelfClean, a representation-to-rank data auditing framework, from the image to the audio domain. This approach leverages self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues, creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single, unified process. The method is benchmarked on the ESC-50, GTZAN, and a proprietary industrial dataset, using both synthetic and naturally occurring corruptions. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art ranking performance, often outperforming issue-specific baselines and enabling significant annotation savings by efficiently guiding human review.

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation (PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while retaining adequate ergodic performance.

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.

Abstract: The Transformer Machine Learning (ML) architecture has been gaining considerable momentum in recent years. In particular, computational High-Energy Physics tasks such as jet tagging and particle track reconstruction (tracking), have either achieved proper solutions, or reached considerable milestones using Transformers. On the other hand, the use of specialised hardware accelerators, especially FPGAs, is an effective method to achieve online, or pseudo-online latencies. The development and integration of Transformer-based ML to FPGAs is still ongoing and the support from current tools is very limited to non-existent. Additionally, FPGA resources present a significant constraint. Considering the model size alone, while smaller models can be deployed directly, larger models are to be partitioned in a meaningful and ideally, automated way. We aim to develop methodologies and tools for monolithic, or partitioned Transformer synthesis, specifically targeting inference. Our primary use-case involves two machine learning model designs for tracking, derived from the TrackFormers project. We elaborate our development approach, present preliminary results, and provide comparisons.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ShaoShuai0605/Misevolution . Warning: this paper includes examples that may be offensive or harmful in nature.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains, finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces recovers the corresponding neural architectures.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.

Abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are rapidly escalating in generated data volume, a trend that will intensify with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. This surge in data necessitates critical revisions across the data processing pipeline, with particle track reconstruction being a prime candidate for improvement. In our previous work, we introduced "TrackFormers", a collection of Transformer-based one-shot encoder-only models that effectively associate hits with expected tracks. In this study, we extend our earlier efforts by incorporating loss functions that account for inter-hit correlations, conducting detailed investigations into (various) Transformer attention mechanisms, and a study on the reconstruction of higher-level objects. Furthermore we discuss new datasets that allow the training on hit level for a range of physics processes. These developments collectively aim to boost both the accuracy, and potentially the efficiency of our tracking models, offering a robust solution to meet the demands of next-generation high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models, which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and adaptive strategies.

<title>An Orthogonal Learner for Individualized Outcomes in Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: Predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making is central for optimizing therapeutic decisions in personalized medicine (e.g., which dosing sequence to give to a cancer patient). However, predicting potential outcomes over long horizons is notoriously difficult. Existing methods that break the curse of the horizon typically lack strong theoretical guarantees such as orthogonality and quasi-oracle efficiency. In this paper, we revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result, we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1) doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency (i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, thereby showing that our meta-learner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable. We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable, and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline fixed-point method.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis, such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components. This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve 81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/tutuzeraa/ASGRA.

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly, ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making.

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and guided-diffusion methods.

Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

<title>Signal-Aware Workload Shifting Algorithms with Uncertainty-Quantified Predictors</title>

Abstract: A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use electricity prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values are typically available, prior work on learning-augmented online algorithms has relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the forecasting research has made significant progress in uncertainty quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage UQ predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts through a $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing $\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that effectively interact with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) remains a challenging open problem, especially for small on-device models. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact, end-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models, we build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data mixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthening inference-time performance through chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, and reinforcement learning with designed rewards. Ferret-UI Lite achieves competitive performance with other small-scale GUI agents. In GUI grounding, Ferret-UI Lite attains scores of $91.6\%$, $53.3\%$, and $61.2\%$ on the ScreenSpot-V2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and OSWorld-G benchmarks, respectively. For GUI navigation, Ferret-UI Lite achieves success rates of $28.0\%$ on AndroidWorld and $19.8\%$ on OSWorld. We share our methods and lessons learned from developing compact, on-device GUI agents.

<title>Towards Verified Code Reasoning by LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.

<title>Pretrain-Test Task Alignment Governs Generalization in In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a central capability of Transformer models, but the structures in data that enable its emergence and govern its robustness remain poorly understood. In this work, we study how the structure of pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers. Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance. Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant of generalization in ICL.

Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality, is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However, their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.
  This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to capture and characterize the runtime behavior of DNNs during inference by using their underlying graph structure. Inspired by system audit provenance graphs, DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.
  We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs, significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average 55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness. Beyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an adaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as privacy auditing and fairness analysis.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence algorithms are introduced in this work as a tool to predict the performance of new chemical compounds as alternative propellants for electric propulsion, focusing on predicting their ionisation characteristics and fragmentation patterns. The chemical properties and structure of the compounds are encoded using a chemical fingerprint, and the training datasets are extracted from the NIST WebBook. The AI-predicted ionisation energy and minimum appearance energy have a mean relative error of 6.87% and 7.99%, respectively, and a predicted ion mass with a 23.89% relative error. In the cases of full mass spectra due to electron ionisation, the predictions have a cosine similarity of 0.6395 and align with the top 10 most similar mass spectra in 78% of instances within a 30 Da range.

Abstract: In this work, we study the task of multi-singer separation in a cappella music, where the number of active singers varies across mixtures. To address this, we use a power set-based data augmentation strategy that expands limited multi-singer datasets into exponentially more training samples. To separate singers, we introduce SepACap, an adaptation of SepReformer, a state-of-the-art speaker separation model architecture. We adapt the model with periodic activations and a composite loss function that remains effective when stems are silent, enabling robust detection and separation. Experiments on the JaCappella dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both full-ensemble and subset singer separation scenarios, outperforming spectrogram-based baselines while generalizing to realistic mixtures with varying numbers of singers.

<title>Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.

Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness} against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by 183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will open-source all experimental logs and system code at https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist/.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos, including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10 tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency. Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward signals from diverse video sources.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover, preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30 seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks, without any learning curriculum.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs) trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years, but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models. We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top models still have significant room for improvement in position-based generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206% on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while integrating position control into leading models training-free.

Abstract: Generative adversarial nets (GANs) and variational auto-encoders have significantly improved our distribution modeling capabilities, showing promise for dataset augmentation, image-to-image translation and feature learning. However, to model high-dimensional distributions, sequential training and stacked architectures are common, increasing the number of tunable hyper-parameters as well as the training time. Nonetheless, the sample complexity of the distance metrics remains one of the factors affecting GAN training. We first show that the recently proposed sliced Wasserstein distance has compelling sample complexity properties when compared to the Wasserstein distance. To further improve the sliced Wasserstein distance we then analyze its `projection complexity' and develop the max-sliced Wasserstein distance which enjoys compelling sample complexity while reducing projection complexity, albeit necessitating a max estimation. We finally illustrate that the proposed distance trains GANs on high-dimensional images up to a resolution of 256x256 easily.

Abstract: State-of-the-art multi-objective optimization often assumes a known utility function, learns it interactively, or computes the full Pareto front-each requiring costly expert input.~Real-world problems, however, involve implicit preferences that are hard to formalize. To reduce expert involvement, we propose an offline, interpretable utility learning method that uses expert knowledge, historical examples, and coarse information about the utility space to reduce sample requirements. We model uncertainty via a full Bayesian posterior and propagate it throughout the optimization process. Our method outperforms standard Gaussian processes and BOPE across four domains, showing strong performance even with biased samples, as encountered in the real-world, and limited expert input.

Abstract: Recent scientific advances require complex experiment design, necessitating the meticulous tuning of many experiment parameters. Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a widely used Bayesian optimization method in recent parameter tuning frameworks such as Hyperopt and Optuna. Despite its popularity, the roles of each control parameter in TPE and the algorithm intuition have not been discussed so far. The goal of this paper is to identify the roles of each control parameter and their impacts on parameter tuning based on the ablation studies using diverse benchmark datasets. The recommended setting concluded from the ablation studies is demonstrated to improve the performance of TPE. Our TPE implementation used in this paper is available at https://github.com/nabenabe0928/tpe/tree/single-opt.

Abstract: Neural networks are typically sensitive to small input perturbations, leading to unexpected or brittle behaviour. We present RobustNeuralNetworks.jl: a Julia package for neural network models that are constructed to naturally satisfy a set of user-defined robustness metrics. The package is based on the recently proposed Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) and Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Network (LBDN) model classes, and is designed to interface directly with Julia's most widely-used machine learning package, Flux.jl. We discuss the theory behind our model parameterization, give an overview of the package, and provide a tutorial demonstrating its use in image classification, reinforcement learning, and nonlinear state-observer design.

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) is widely used in reinforcement learning due to its scalability and good performance. In recent years, several variance-reduced PG methods have been proposed with a theoretical guarantee of converging to an approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP) with the sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. However, FOSPs could be bad local optima or saddle points. Moreover, these algorithms often use importance sampling (IS) weights which could impair the statistical effectiveness of variance reduction. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced second-order method that uses second-order information in the form of Hessian vector products (HVP) and converges to an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) with sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. This rate improves the best-known sample complexity for achieving approximate SOSPs by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-0.5})$. Moreover, the proposed variance reduction technique bypasses IS weights by using HVP terms. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art and is more robust to changes in random seeds.

Abstract: Model extraction (ME) attacks represent one major threat to Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms by ``stealing'' the functionality of confidential machine-learning models through querying black-box APIs. Over seven years have passed since ME attacks were first conceptualized in the seminal work. During this period, substantial advances have been made in both ME attacks and MLaaS platforms, raising the intriguing question: How has the vulnerability of MLaaS platforms to ME attacks been evolving? In this work, we conduct an in-depth study to answer this critical question. Specifically, we characterize the vulnerability of current, mainstream MLaaS platforms to ME attacks from multiple perspectives including attack strategies, learning techniques, surrogate-model design, and benchmark tasks. Many of our findings challenge previously reported results, suggesting emerging patterns of ME vulnerability. Further, by analyzing the vulnerability of the same MLaaS platforms using historical datasets from the past four years, we retrospectively characterize the evolution of ME vulnerability over time, leading to a set of interesting findings. Finally, we make suggestions about improving the current practice of MLaaS in terms of attack robustness. Our study sheds light on the current state of ME vulnerability in the wild and points to several promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are expensive to train, and there is a growing concern about the challenge of retroactively removing specific training data. Achieving exact unlearning in deep learning pipelines--producing models as if certain data had never been included in training--remains an open problem. In this paper, we revisit exact unlearning in deep learning and show that for large language models (LLMs) we can efficiently exactly unlearn "fine-tuning data" (the data used to adapt a pre-trained model). This follows from two observations. First, we can use in-context learning to adapt the LLM to the fine-tuning dataset instead of SGD based algorithms. Second, we show that accurate in-context learning can be done with quantized k-means, which allows for effectively constant time unlearning operations. Our evaluation shows that this unlearning recipe has similar performance to fine-tuning alternatives, but vastly reduces the unlearning costs. Our study also highlights the need for new measures of unlearning cost when adapting the learning algorithm to have faster unlearn operations.

<title>Collective Counterfactual Explanations: Balancing Individual Goals and Collective Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide individuals with cost-optimal recommendations to achieve their desired outcomes. However, when a significant number of individuals seek similar state modifications, this individual-centric approach can inadvertently create competition and introduce unforeseen costs. Additionally, disregarding the underlying data distribution may lead to recommendations that individuals perceive as unusual or impractical. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that extends standard counterfactual explanations by incorporating a population dynamics model. This framework penalizes deviations from equilibrium after individuals follow the recommendations, effectively mitigating externalities caused by correlated changes across the population. By balancing individual modification costs with their impact on others, our method ensures more equitable and efficient outcomes. We show how this approach reframes the counterfactual explanation problem from an individual-centric task to a collective optimization problem. Augmenting our theoretical insights, we design and implement scalable algorithms for computing collective counterfactuals, showcasing their effectiveness and advantages over existing recourse methods, particularly in aligning with collective objectives.

Abstract: A recent line of research has been investigating deep learning approaches to wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance against diverse channel conditions, they also have a major drawback: they require processing high-dimensional features, which can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a positioning neural network (P-NN) that substantially reduces the complexity of deep learning-based WP through carefully crafted minimum description features. Our feature selection is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We also develop a novel methodology for adaptively selecting the size of feature space, which optimizes over balancing the expected amount of useful information and classification capability, quantified using information-theoretic measures on the signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP).

<title>From Mean to Extreme: Formal Differential Privacy Bounds on the Success of Real-World Data Reconstruction Attacks</title>

Abstract: The gold standard for privacy in machine learning, Differential Privacy (DP), is often interpreted through its guarantees against membership inference. However, translating DP budgets into quantitative protection against the more damaging threat of data reconstruction remains a challenging open problem. Existing theoretical analyses of reconstruction risk are typically based on an "identification" threat model, where an adversary with a candidate set seeks a perfect match. When applied to the realistic threat of "from-scratch" attacks, these bounds can lead to an inefficient privacy-utility trade-off.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by deriving the first formal privacy bounds tailored to the mechanics of demonstrated Analytic Gradient Inversion Attacks (AGIAs). We first formalize the optimal from-scratch attack strategy for an adversary with no prior knowledge, showing it reduces to a mean estimation problem. We then derive closed-form, probabilistic bounds on this adversary's success, measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Our empirical evaluation confirms these bounds remain tight even when the attack is concealed within large, complex network architectures.
  Our work provides a crucial second anchor for risk assessment. By establishing a tight, worst-case bound for the from-scratch threat model, we enable practitioners to assess a "risk corridor" bounded by the identification-based worst case on one side and our from-scratch worst case on the other. This allows for a more holistic, context-aware judgment of privacy risk, empowering practitioners to move beyond abstract budgets toward a principled reasoning framework for calibrating the privacy of their models.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for unraveling cellular heterogeneity and diversity, offering invaluable insights for bioinformatics advancements. Despite its potential, traditional clustering methods in scRNA-seq data analysis often neglect the structural information embedded in gene expression profiles, crucial for understanding cellular correlations and dependencies. Existing strategies, including graph neural networks, face challenges in handling the inefficiency due to scRNA-seq data's intrinsic high-dimension and high-sparsity. Addressing these limitations, we introduce scCDCG (single-cell RNA-seq Clustering via Deep Cut-informed Graph), a novel framework designed for efficient and accurate clustering of scRNA-seq data that simultaneously utilizes intercellular high-order structural information. scCDCG comprises three main components: (i) A graph embedding module utilizing deep cut-informed techniques, which effectively captures intercellular high-order structural information, overcoming the over-smoothing and inefficiency issues prevalent in prior graph neural network methods. (ii) A self-supervised learning module guided by optimal transport, tailored to accommodate the unique complexities of scRNA-seq data, specifically its high-dimension and high-sparsity. (iii) An autoencoder-based feature learning module that simplifies model complexity through effective dimension reduction and feature extraction. Our extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate scCDCG's superior performance and efficiency compared to 7 established models, underscoring scCDCG's potential as a transformative tool in scRNA-seq data analysis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XPgogogo/scCDCG.

Abstract: Federated Learning faces significant challenges in statistical and system heterogeneity, along with high energy consumption, necessitating efficient client selection strategies. Traditional approaches, including heuristic and learning-based methods, fall short of addressing these complexities holistically. In response, we propose FedGCS, a novel generative client selection framework that innovatively recasts the client selection process as a generative task. Drawing inspiration from the methodologies used in large language models, FedGCS efficiently encodes abundant decision-making knowledge within a continuous representation space, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization to search for optimal client selection that will be finally output via generation. The framework comprises four steps: (1) automatic collection of diverse "selection-score" pair data using classical client selection methods; (2) training an encoder-evaluator-decoder framework on this data to construct a continuous representation space; (3) employing gradient-based optimization in this space for optimal client selection; (4) generating the final optimal client selection via using beam search for the well-trained decoder. FedGCS outperforms traditional methods by being more comprehensive, generalizable, and efficient, simultaneously optimizing for model performance, latency, and energy consumption. The effectiveness of FedGCS is proven through extensive experimental analyses.

Abstract: The auto-regressive decoding of Large Language Models (LLMs) results in significant overheads in their hardware performance. While recent research has investigated various speculative decoding techniques for multi-token generation, these efforts have primarily focused on improving processing speed such as throughput. Crucially, they often neglect other metrics essential for real-life deployments, such as memory consumption and training cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that requires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a single A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours. Inspired by the human natural language generation process, $PPD$ approximates outputs generated at future timesteps in parallel by using multiple prompt tokens. This approach partially recovers the missing conditional dependency information necessary for multi-token generation, resulting in up to a 28% higher acceptance rate for long-range predictions. Furthermore, we present a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree technique that adaptively optimizes this decoding scheme to fully leverage the computational capacities on different GPUs. Through extensive experiments across LLMs ranging from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B on a wide range of benchmarks, our approach demonstrates up to 2.49$\times$ speedup and maintains a minimal runtime memory overhead of just $0.0004$%. More importantly, our parallel prompt decoding can serve as an orthogonal optimization for synergistic integration with existing speculative decoding, showing up to $1.22\times$ further speed improvement. Our code is available at https://github.com/hmarkc/parallel-prompt-decoding.

Abstract: While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently proposed hybrid architectures seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose Manticore, a framework that addresses these challenges by automating the design of hybrid architectures while reusing pretrained models to create pretrained hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to program pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids match existing manually designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena, and improve on pretrained transformers and state space models on various natural language tasks.

Abstract: Demand for air travel is rising, straining existing aviation infrastructure. In the US, more than 90% of airport control towers are understaffed, falling short of FAA and union standards. This, in part, has contributed to an uptick in near-misses and safety-critical events, highlighting the need for advancements in air traffic management technologies to ensure safe and efficient operations. Data-driven predictive models for terminal airspace show potential to address these challenges; however, the lack of large-scale surface movement datasets in the public domain has hindered the development of scalable and generalizable approaches. To address this, we introduce Amelia-42, a first-of-its-kind large collection of raw airport surface movements reports streamed through the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program, comprising over two years of trajectory data (~9.19TB) across 42 US airports. We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. All resources are available at our website: https://ameliacmu.github.io and https://huggingface.co/AmeliaCMU.

Abstract: Interpretability provides a toolset for understanding how and why neural networks behave in certain ways. However, there is little unity in the field: most studies employ ad-hoc evaluations and do not share theoretical foundations, making it difficult to measure progress and compare the pros and cons of different techniques. Furthermore, while mechanistic understanding is frequently discussed, the basic causal units underlying these mechanisms are often not explicitly defined. In this article, we propose a perspective on interpretability research grounded in causal mediation analysis. Specifically, we describe the history and current state of interpretability taxonomized according to the types of causal units (mediators) employed, as well as methods used to search over mediators. We discuss the pros and cons of each mediator, providing insights as to when particular kinds of mediators and search methods are most appropriate. We argue that this framing yields a more cohesive narrative of the field and helps researchers select appropriate methods based on their research objective. Our analysis yields actionable recommendations for future work, including the discovery of new mediators and the development of standardized evaluations tailored to these goals.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning approach for inferring causal variables of a target variable from observations. Our focus is on directly inferring a set of causal factors without requiring full causal graph reconstruction, which is computationally challenging in large-scale systems. The identified causal set consists of all potential regulators of the target variable under experimental settings, enabling efficient regulation through intervention. To achieve this, we train a neural network using supervised learning on simulated data to infer causality. By employing a subsampled-ensemble inference strategy, our approach scales with linear complexity in the number of variables, efficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in identifying causal relationships within large-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing methods that emphasize full-graph discovery. We validate our model's generalization capability across out-of-distribution graph structures and generating mechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562 cell line. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Targeted-Cause-Discovery.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.

Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables \emph{analytical} construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGS (\emph{\underline{Co}mposing \underline{G}lobal \underline{S}olutions}). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of \emph{sum potentials}, which are ring homomorphisms, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global solutions constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global solutions such as perfect memorization are unfavorable. The code is open sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/luckmatters/tree/yuandong3/ssl/real-dataset.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that effectively addresses periodicity modeling challenges while offering broad applicability similar to MLP with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but face challenges in scaling to deeper networks and are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach overcomes this challenge to enable scaling to large-scale models and maintains general-purpose modeling capability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks. Moreover, we reveal that compared to existing Fourier-based networks, FAN accommodates both periodicity modeling and general-purpose modeling well.

Abstract: An unsolved issue in widely used methods such as Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Small Sphere and Large Margin SVM (SSLM) for anomaly detection is their nonconvexity, which hampers the analysis of optimal solutions in a manner similar to SVMs and limits their applicability in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel convex SSLM formulation which has been demonstrated to revert to a convex quadratic programming problem for hyperparameter values of interest. Leveraging the convexity of our method, we derive numerous results that are unattainable with traditional nonconvex approaches. We conduct a thorough analysis of how hyperparameters influence the optimal solution, pointing out scenarios where optimal solutions can be trivially found and identifying instances of ill-posedness. Most notably, we establish connections between our method and traditional approaches, providing a clear determination of when the optimal solution is unique--a task unachievable with traditional nonconvex methods. We also derive the nu-property to elucidate the interactions between hyperparameters and the fractions of support vectors and margin errors in both positive and negative classes.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.

<title>Dynamic Pricing in High-Speed Railways Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical challenge in the high-speed passenger railway industry: designing effective dynamic pricing strategies in the context of competing and cooperating operators. To address this, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on a non-zero-sum Markov game is proposed, incorporating random utility models to capture passenger decision making. Unlike prior studies in areas such as energy, airlines, and mobile networks, dynamic pricing for railway systems using deep reinforcement learning has received limited attention. A key contribution of this paper is a parametrisable and versatile reinforcement learning simulator designed to model a variety of railway network configurations and demand patterns while enabling realistic, microscopic modelling of user behaviour, called RailPricing-RL. This environment supports the proposed MARL framework, which models heterogeneous agents competing to maximise individual profits while fostering cooperative behaviour to synchronise connecting services. Experimental results validate the framework, demonstrating how user preferences affect MARL performance and how pricing policies influence passenger choices, utility, and overall system dynamics. This study provides a foundation for advancing dynamic pricing strategies in railway systems, aligning profitability with system-wide efficiency, and supporting future research on optimising pricing policies.

Abstract: We evaluate the ability of the current generation of large language models (LLMs) to help a decision-making agent facing an exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We use LLMs to explore and exploit in silos in various (contextual) bandit tasks. We find that while the current LLMs often struggle to exploit, in-context mitigations may be used to substantially improve performance for small-scale tasks. However even then, LLMs perform worse than a simple linear regression. On the other hand, we find that LLMs do help at exploring large action spaces with inherent semantics, by suggesting suitable candidates to explore.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning agents face significant deployment challenges due to the synthetic-to-real distribution mismatch. While most prior research has focused on improving the fidelity of synthetic sampling and incorporating off-policy mechanisms, the directly integrated paradigm often fails to ensure consistent policy behavior in biased models and underlying environmental dynamics, which inherently arise from discrepancies between behavior and learning policies. In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DAMO effectively ensures model and policy alignments, achieving competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization has emerged as a technique for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems that involve an outer objective implicitly determined by the minimizer of an inner problem. While prior works have primarily focused on the parametric setting, a learning-theoretic foundation for bilevel optimization in the nonparametric case remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by studying Kernel Bilevel Optimization (KBO), where the inner objective is optimized over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This setting enables rich function approximation while providing a foundation for rigorous theoretical analysis. In this context, we derive novel finite-sample generalization bounds for KBO, leveraging tools from empirical process theory. These bounds further allow us to assess the statistical accuracy of gradient-based methods applied to the empirical discretization of KBO. We numerically illustrate our theoretical findings on a synthetic instrumental variable regression task.

Abstract: Linear Transformers and State Space Models have emerged as efficient alternatives to softmax Transformers for causal sequence modeling, enabling parallel training via matrix multiplication and efficient RNN-style inference. However, despite their success in causal tasks, no unified framework exists for applying Linear Transformers to bidirectional sequence modeling. We introduce LION, the first framework to systematically extend Linear Transformers to the bidirectional setting. LION generalizes three core representations commonly used in the causal case - full Linear Attention , bidirectional RNN, and chunkwise parallel form - to the bidirectional setting. These forms are theoretically equivalent and enable models to exploit the strengths of each during training and inference. We prove that a broad class of Linear Transformers can be extended using LION and validate our framework via three core examples based on the choice of decay type: LION-LIT, the bidirectional extension of arXiv:2006.16236; LION-D, based on arXiv:2307.08621; and LION-S, a variant using selective decay arXiv:2103.02143, arXiv:2312.0075. Across standard bidirectional tasks, LION enables models to match or exceed the performance of softmax Transformers, while offering significantly faster training and more efficient inference than existing State Space Models.

Abstract: Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a broadly applicable solution for learning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Data contamination has received increasing attention in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to their reliance on vast Internet-derived training corpora. To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap-the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts. We maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link.

Abstract: As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.

Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue, but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MoE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/HBP.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have emerged as a promising research direction for solving inverse problems.
  However, current studies primarily focus on natural image restoration, leaving the performance of these algorithms in scientific inverse problems largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{InverseBench}, a framework that evaluates diffusion models across five distinct scientific inverse problems. These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms. To facilitate further research and development, we open-source the codebase, along with datasets and pre-trained models, at https://devzhk.github.io/InverseBench/.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for multi-task learning (MTL), offering a data-efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning. However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models. Our code is open-sourced at github.com/hmarkc/FW-Merging.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for program verification, and yet little is known about \emph{how} they reason about program semantics during this process. In this work, we focus on abstract interpretation based-reasoning for invariant generation and introduce two novel prompting strategies that aim to elicit such reasoning from LLMs. We evaluate these strategies across several state-of-the-art LLMs on 22 programs from the SV-COMP benchmark suite widely used in software verification. We analyze both the soundness of the generated invariants and the key thematic patterns in the models' reasoning errors. This work aims to highlight new research opportunities at the intersection of LLMs and program verification for applying LLMs to verification tasks and advancing their reasoning capabilities in this application.

Abstract: The automated detection of hallucinations and training data contamination is pivotal to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). These tasks are particularly challenging in settings where no access to model internals is available. Current approaches in this setup typically leverage only the probabilities of actual tokens in the text, relying on simple task-specific heuristics. Crucially, they overlook the information contained in the full sequence of next-token probability distributions. We propose to go beyond hand-crafted decision rules by learning directly from the complete observable output of LLMs -- consisting not only of next-token probabilities, but also the full sequence of next-token distributions. We refer to this as the LLM Output Signature (LOS), and treat it as a reference data type for detecting hallucinations and data contamination. To that end, we introduce LOS-Net, a lightweight attention-based architecture trained on an efficient encoding of the LOS, which can provably approximate a broad class of existing techniques for both tasks. Empirically, LOS-Net achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, while maintaining extremely low detection latency. Furthermore, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs. Full code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/Beyond-next-token-probabilities.

Abstract: Attention is foundational to large language models (LLMs), enabling different heads to have diverse focus on relevant input tokens. However, learned behaviors like attention sinks, where the first token receives the most attention despite limited semantic importance, suggest some heads may be inactive, and point to a significant source of computational redundancy. To analyze this phenomenon, we propose a taxonomy of 13 score functions that measure different ways a head can be inactive. Thresholding these scores allows us to analyze different sets of potentially inactive attention heads. We evaluate whether identified heads are inactive through model interventions, finding that more than 12% of attention heads are inactive on average, and can be ablated in specific contexts while maintaining MMLU accuracy to within 1% of the pretrained LLM. Across 3 model families, our score functions that measure the average norm of a head's output consistently identify inactive heads that would not have been found by score functions that rely solely on attention weights. We establish that relying on a score function that measures a first token attention sink would underestimate the prevalence of inactive heads, failing to identify more than 7% of inactive heads on average. We also show how measuring score distributions can provide insights into attention behavior. For instance, we find evidence that finetuning causes little to no change in attention behavior, and that even within the same model family, large model scales present markedly different attention behaviors.

Abstract: Instruction finetuning attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by subtly embedding poisoned examples in finetuning datasets, leading to harmful or unintended behaviors in downstream applications. Detecting such attacks is challenging because poisoned data is often indistinguishable from clean data and prior knowledge of triggers or attack strategies is rarely available. We present a detection method that requires no prior knowledge of the attack. Our approach leverages influence functions under semantic transformation: by comparing influence distributions before and after a sentiment inversion, we identify critical poison examples whose influence is strong and remain unchanged before and after inversion. We show that this method works on sentiment classification task and math reasoning task, for different language models. Removing a small set of critical poisons (about 1% of the data) restores the model performance to near-clean levels. These results demonstrate the practicality of influence-based diagnostics for defending against instruction fine-tuning attacks in real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage (EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: Backpropagation underpins modern deep learning, yet its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and incurs high memory costs. In contrast, fully local learning rules are more efficient but often struggle to maintain the cross-layer coordination needed for coherent global learning. Building on this tension, we introduce Stochastic Layer-wise Learning (SLL), a layer-wise training algorithm that decomposes the global objective into coordinated layer-local updates while preserving global representational coherence. The method is ELBO-inspired under a Markov assumption on the network, where the network-level objective decomposes into layer-wise terms and each layer optimizes a local objective via a deterministic encoder. The intractable KL in ELBO is replaced by a Bhattacharyya surrogate computed on auxiliary categorical posteriors obtained via fixed geometry-preserving random projections, with optional multiplicative dropout providing stochastic regularization. SLL optimizes locally, aligns globally, thereby eliminating cross-layer backpropagation. Experiments on MLPs, CNNs, and Vision Transformers from MNIST to ImageNet show that the approach surpasses recent local methods and matches global BP performance while memory usage invariant with depth. The results demonstrate a practical and principled path to modular and scalable local learning that couples purely local computation with globally coherent representations.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity challenges by leveraging unlabeled data. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs), pre-trained on massive image-text pairs, have demonstrated remarkable zero-/few-shot performance that often surpasses SSL approaches due to their exceptional generalization capabilities. This gap motivates us to question: how can we effectively harness the powerful generalization capabilities of VLMs into task-specific models? Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a natural framework for transferring VLM capabilities, but we identify that it suffers from gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation losses. To address this challenge, we propose Dual-Head Optimization (DHO), which introduces dual prediction heads for each distinct signal. We observe that DHO resolves gradient conflicts, enabling improved feature learning compared to single-head KD baselines, with practical benefits of minimal computational overhead and test-time hyperparameter tuning without retraining. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets show that DHO consistently outperforms KD baselines, often outperforming teacher models with smaller student models. DHO also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution ImageNet semi-supervised learning and out-of-distribution generalization across ImageNet variants. We publicly release our code and model checkpoints to facilitate future research at https://github.com/erjui/DHO.

Abstract: The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) is a mathematical framework that enables closed-form approximations for minimal training loss and related performance measures in deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper leverages the UFM to provide qualitative insights into neural multivariate regression, a critical task in imitation learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning. Specifically, we address two key questions: (1) How do multi-task models compare to multiple single-task models in terms of training performance? (2) Can whitening and normalizing regression targets improve training performance? The UFM theory predicts that multi-task models achieve strictly smaller training MSE than multiple single-task models when the same or stronger regularization is applied to the latter, and our empirical results confirm these findings. Regarding whitening and normalizing regression targets, the UFM theory predicts that they reduce training MSE when the average variance across the target dimensions is less than one, and our empirical results once again confirm these findings. These findings highlight the UFM as a powerful framework for deriving actionable insights into DNN design and data pre-processing strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents AutoRAN, the first framework to automate the hijacking of internal safety reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs). At its core, AutoRAN pioneers an execution simulation paradigm that leverages a weaker but less-aligned model to simulate execution reasoning for initial hijacking attempts and iteratively refine attacks by exploiting reasoning patterns leaked through the target LRM's refusals. This approach steers the target model to bypass its own safety guardrails and elaborate on harmful instructions. We evaluate AutoRAN against state-of-the-art LRMs, including GPT-o3/o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across multiple benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, and StrongReject). Results show that AutoRAN achieves approaching 100% success rate within one or few turns, effectively neutralizing reasoning-based defenses even when evaluated by robustly aligned external models. This work reveals that the transparency of the reasoning process itself creates a critical and exploitable attack surface, highlighting the urgent need for new defenses that protect models' reasoning traces rather than merely their final outputs.

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into {[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step," which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods such as majority voting or best-of-n. Moreover, VGS significantly reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization. The project page is at https://rlvla.github.io

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on graph-structured data typically faces non-IID challenges, particularly in scenarios where each client holds a distinct subgraph sampled from a global graph. In this paper, we introduce Federated learning with Auxiliary projections (FedAux), a personalized subgraph FL framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and personalization performance. The code is available at https://github.com/JhuoW/FedAux.

Abstract: Graph generative models have shown strong results in molecular design but struggle to scale to large, complex structures. While hierarchical methods improve scalability, they usually ignore node and edge features, which are critical in real-world applications. This issue is amplified in hypergraphs, where hyperedges capture higher-order relationships among multiple nodes. Despite their importance in domains such as 3D geometry, molecular systems, and circuit design, existing generative models rarely support both hypergraphs and feature generation at scale. In this paper, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical framework that jointly generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds multi-scale representations through node coarsening and refines them via localized expansion, guided by a novel node budget mechanism that controls granularity and ensures consistency across scales. Experiments on synthetic, 3D mesh and graph point cloud datasets show that FAHNES achieves state-of-the-art performance in jointly generating features and structure, advancing scalable hypergraph and graph generation.

<title>On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings</title>

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: Recent literature generalization in deep learning has examined the relationship between the curvature of the loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of overparameterized neural networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We show that when an exponential family neural network model is exactly calibrated, and its prediction error and its confidence on the prediction are not correlated with the first and the second derivative of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect a soft rank based flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, the diverse and often conflicting biases present across clients pose significant challenges to model fairness. Current fairness-enhancing FL solutions often fall short, as they typically mitigate biases for a single, usually binary, sensitive attribute, while ignoring the heterogeneous fairness needs that exist in real-world settings. Moreover, these solutions often evaluate unfairness reduction only on the server side, hiding persistent unfairness at the individual client level. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework for fairness-aware FL at both the global and client levels. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We introduce \fairdataset, a library to create tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Abstract: Industrial carbon emissions are a major driver of climate change, yet modeling these emissions is challenging due to multicollinearity among factors and complex interdependencies across sectors and time. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework DGL to analyze and forecast industrial CO_2 emissions, addressing high feature correlation and capturing industrial-temporal interdependencies. Unlike traditional regression or clustering methods, our approach leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to model relationships between industries (or regions) and a temporal transformer to learn long-range patterns. We evaluate our framework on public global industry emissions dataset derived from EDGAR v8.0, spanning multiple countries and sectors. The proposed model achieves superior predictive performance - reducing error by over 15% compared to baseline deep models - while maintaining interpretability via attention weights and causal analysis. We believe that we are the first Graph-Temporal architecture that resolves multicollinearity by structurally encoding feature relationships, along with integration of causal inference to identify true drivers of emissions, improving transparency and fairness. We also stand a demonstration of policy relevance, showing how model insights can guide sector-specific decarbonization strategies aligned with sustainable development goals. Based on the above, we show high-emission "hotspots" and suggest equitable intervention plans, illustrating the potential of state-of-the-art AI graph learning to advance climate action, offering a powerful tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders to achieve carbon reduction targets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size. Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy. Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to 48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example, computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100 time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics research.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential. These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical simulations to sequential decision-making-require sequentially dependent computational steps that cannot be efficiently parallelized. We formalize this distinction in complexity theory, and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks. Then, we show for first time that diffusion models despite their sequential nature are incapable of solving inherently serial problems. We argue that recognizing the serial nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model design, and hardware development.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, we use the Qwen3 Embedding model to derive a compact yet expressive feature representation; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition functions. This presents a significant practical challenge: an inappropriate combination can lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have been actively explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair has been largely overlooked, forcing practitioners to rely on heuristics or costly manual tuning.
  We propose BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique), a novel framework that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various kernel-acquisition pairs and identify the most promising pair before committing to expensive evaluations.
  Using K-means clustering, BOOST first selects initial subsets from previously observed data-in-hand and prepares all possible kernel-acquisition pairs from user-chosen candidates. For each pair, BOOST conducts internal BO runs starting with the initial subset, evaluating how many iterations are required to find the target value within the remaining data, thereby identifying the pair with the best retrospective performance for future optimization.
  Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO with fixed hyperparameters and state-of-the-art adaptive methods, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse problem landscapes.

<title>From Source to Target: Leveraging Transfer Learning for Predictive Process Monitoring in Organizations</title>

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM) transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime. Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other relevant resources that might not be readily available, which prevents some organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. This technique is instantiated in both a real-life intra- and an inter-organizational use case, based on which numerical experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes. The results of the experiments suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective PPM in the target context. The proposed technique allows organizations to benefit from transfer learning in intra- and inter-organizational settings by transferring resources such as pre-trained models within and across organizational boundaries.

<title>Projected Coupled Diffusion for Test-Time Constrained Joint Generation</title>

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model. However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning. Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

<title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

<title>Ban&amp;Pick: Ehancing Performance and Efficiency of MoE-LLMs via Smarter Routing</title>

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency at inference. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&amp;Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban further dynamically prunes redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban\&amp;Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from 65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the vLLM.

<title>Inducing Uncertainty on Open-Weight Models for Test-Time Privacy in Image Recognition</title>

Abstract: A key concern for AI safety remains understudied in the machine learning (ML) literature: how can we ensure users of ML models do not leverage predictions on incorrect personal data to harm others? This is particularly pertinent given the rise of open-weight models, where simply masking model outputs does not suffice to prevent adversaries from recovering harmful predictions. To address this threat, which we call *test-time privacy*, we induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on all other instances. Our proposed algorithm uses a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains at least $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with marginal drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.

<title>FlowCast-ODE: Continuous Hourly Weather Forecasting with Dynamic Flow Matching and ODE Solver</title>

Abstract: Data-driven hourly weather forecasting models often face the challenge of error accumulation in long-term predictions. The problem is exacerbated by non-physical temporal discontinuities present in widely-used training datasets such as ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), which stem from its 12-hour assimilation cycle. Such artifacts lead hourly autoregressive models to learn spurious dynamics and rapidly accumulate errors. To address this, we introduce FlowCast-ODE, a novel framework that treats atmospheric evolution as a continuous flow to ensure temporal coherence. Our method employs dynamic flow matching to learn the instantaneous velocity field from data and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to generate smooth and temporally continuous hourly predictions. By pre-training on 6-hour intervals to sidestep data discontinuities and fine-tuning on hourly data, FlowCast-ODE produces seamless forecasts for up to 120 hours with a single lightweight model. It achieves competitive or superior skill on key meteorological variables compared to baseline models, preserves fine-grained spatial details, and demonstrates strong performance in forecasting extreme events, such as tropical cyclone tracks.

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios. The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data. Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.

Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE, recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph structure is important.

Abstract: Recently, deep learning approaches have provided solutions to difficult problems in wireless positioning (WP). Although these WP algorithms have attained excellent and consistent performance against complex channel environments, the computational complexity coming from processing high-dimensional features can be prohibitive for mobile applications. In this work, we design a novel positioning neural network (P-NN) that utilizes the minimum description features to substantially reduce the complexity of deep learning-based WP. P-NN's feature selection strategy is based on maximum power measurements and their temporal locations to convey information needed to conduct WP. We improve P-NN's learning ability by intelligently processing two different types of inputs: sparse image and measurement matrices. Specifically, we implement a self-attention layer to reinforce the training ability of our network. We also develop a technique to adapt feature space size, optimizing over the expected information gain and the classification capability quantified with information-theoretic measures on signal bin selection. Numerical results show that P-NN achieves a significant advantage in performance-complexity tradeoff over deep learning baselines that leverage the full power delay profile (PDP). In particular, we find that P-NN achieves a large improvement in performance for low SNR, as unnecessary measurements are discarded in our minimum description features.

Abstract: In recent years, street view imagery has grown to become one of the most important sources of geospatial data collection and urban analytics, which facilitates generating meaningful insights and assisting in decision-making. Synthesizing a street-view image from its corresponding satellite image is a challenging task due to the significant differences in appearance and viewpoint between the two domains. In this study, we screened 20 recent research papers to provide a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of how street-view images are synthesized from their corresponding satellite counterparts. The main findings are: (i) novel deep learning techniques are required for synthesizing more realistic and accurate street-view images; (ii) more datasets need to be collected for public usage; and (iii) more specific evaluation metrics need to be investigated for evaluating the generated images appropriately. We conclude that, due to applying outdated deep learning techniques, the recent literature failed to generate detailed and diverse street-view images.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is one of the most critical problems in computational science. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a promising framework for approximating PDE solutions, their accuracy and training speed are limited by two core barriers: gradient-descent-based iterative optimization over complex loss landscapes and non-causal treatment of time as an extra spatial dimension. We present Frozen-PINN, a novel PINN based on the principle of space-time separation that leverages random features instead of training with gradient descent, and incorporates temporal causality by construction. On eight PDE benchmarks, including challenges such as extreme advection speeds, shocks, and high dimensionality, Frozen-PINNs achieve superior training efficiency and accuracy over state-of-the-art PINNs, often by several orders of magnitude. Our work addresses longstanding training and accuracy bottlenecks of PINNs, delivering quickly trainable, highly accurate, and inherently causal PDE solvers, a combination that prior methods could not realize. Our approach challenges the reliance of PINNs on stochastic gradient-descent-based methods and specialized hardware, leading to a paradigm shift in PINN training and providing a challenging benchmark for the community.

<title>Efficient Fairness-Performance Pareto Front Computation</title>

Abstract: There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution.
  In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods.
  Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.

Abstract: Information designers, such as online platforms, often do not know the beliefs of their receivers. We design learning algorithms so that the information designer can learn the receivers' prior belief from their actions through repeated interactions. Our learning algorithms achieve no regret relative to the optimality for the known prior at a fast speed, achieving a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log T)$ in general and a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log \log T)$ in the important special case of binary actions.

Abstract: We propose a deep mixture of multimodal hierarchical variational auto-encoders called MMHVAE that synthesizes missing images from observed images in different modalities. MMHVAE's design focuses on tackling four challenges: (i) creating a complex latent representation of multimodal data to generate high-resolution images; (ii) encouraging the variational distributions to estimate the missing information needed for cross-modal image synthesis; (iii) learning to fuse multimodal information in the context of missing data; (iv) leveraging dataset-level information to handle incomplete data sets at training time. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of pre-operative brain multi-parametric magnetic resonance and intra-operative ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Various watermarking methods (``watermarkers'') have been proposed to identify LLM-generated texts; yet, due to the lack of unified evaluation platforms, many critical questions remain under-explored: i) What are the strengths/limitations of various watermarkers, especially their attack robustness? ii) How do various design choices impact their robustness? iii) How to optimally operate watermarkers in adversarial environments? To fill this gap, we systematize existing LLM watermarkers and watermark removal attacks, mapping out their design spaces. We then develop WaterPark, a unified platform that integrates 10 state-of-the-art watermarkers and 12 representative attacks. More importantly, by leveraging WaterPark, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing watermarkers, unveiling the impact of various design choices on their attack robustness. We further explore the best practices to operate watermarkers in adversarial environments. We believe our study sheds light on current LLM watermarking techniques while WaterPark serves as a valuable testbed to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

<title>A space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints</title>

arXiv:2501.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.

<title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>

arXiv:2502.04575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation, we propose a new algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers, establish a framework for analyzing its complexity, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency in tackling multimodality.

Abstract: Diffusion kernels over graphs have been widely utilized as effective tools in various applications due to their ability to accurately model the flow of information through nodes and edges. However, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the development of surrogate models for diffusion processes on graphs. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing sparse polynomial-based surrogate models for parametric diffusion equations on graphs with community structure. In tandem, we provide convergence guarantees for both least squares and compressed sensing-based approximations by showing the holomorphic regularity of parametric solutions to these diffusion equations. Our theoretical findings are accompanied by a series of numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world graphs that demonstrate the applicability of our methodology.

Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a powerful tool for model owners to identify their shared model given API access. However, to lower false discovery rate, fight fingerprint leakage, and defend against coalitions of model users attempting to bypass detection, we argue that {\em scalability} is critical, i.e., scaling up the number of fingerprints one can embed into a model. Hence, we pose scalability as a crucial requirement for fingerprinting schemes. We experiment with fingerprint design at a scale significantly larger than previously considered, and introduce a new method, dubbed Perinucleus sampling, to generate scalable, persistent, and harmless fingerprints. We demonstrate that this scheme can add 24,576 fingerprints to a Llama-3.1-8B model -- two orders of magnitude more than existing schemes -- without degrading the model's utility. Our inserted fingerprints persist even after supervised fine-tuning on standard post-training data. We further address security risks for fingerprinting, and theoretically and empirically show how a scalable fingerprinting scheme like ours can mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. This paper introduces ThinkSLM, the first extensive benchmark to systematically evaluate and study the reasoning abilities of SLMs trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. We first establish a reliable evaluation criterion comparing available methods and LLM judges against our human evaluations. Then we present a study evaluating 72 diverse SLMs from six major model families across 17 reasoning benchmarks. We repeat all our experiments three times to ensure a robust assessment. Our findings show that: 1) reasoning ability in SLMs is strongly influenced by training methods and data quality rather than solely model scale; 2) quantization preserves reasoning capability, while pruning significantly disrupts it; 3) larger models consistently exhibit higher robustness against adversarial perturbations and intermediate reasoning, but certain smaller models closely match or exceed the larger models' performance. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression.

<title>Solving the Cold Start Problem on One's Own as an End User via Preference Transfer</title>

Abstract: We propose a new approach that enables end users to directly solve the cold start problem by themselves. The cold start problem is a common issue in recommender systems, and many methods have been proposed to address the problem on the service provider's side. However, when the service provider does not take action, users are left with poor recommendations and no means to improve their experience. We propose an algorithm, Pretender, that allows end users to proactively solve the cold start problem on their own. Pretender does not require any special support from the service provider and can be deployed independently by users. We formulate the problem as minimizing the distance between the source and target distributions and optimize item selection from the target service accordingly. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees for Pretender based on a discrete quadrature problem. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pretender.

Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which adapts Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. Our pretrained FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. Moreover, we reveal that FANformer exhibits superior ability to learn and apply rules for reasoning compared to Transformer. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in robotics due to their ability to generate multi-modal distributions of system states and behaviors. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring precise control over the generated outcomes without compromising realism. This is crucial for applications such as motion planning or trajectory forecasting, where adherence to physical constraints and task-specific objectives is essential. We propose a novel framework that enhances controllability in diffusion models by leveraging multi-modal prior distributions and enforcing strong modal coupling. This allows us to initiate the denoising process directly from distinct prior modes that correspond to different possible system behaviors, ensuring sampling to align with the training distribution. We evaluate our approach on motion prediction using the Waymo dataset and multi-task control in Maze2D environments. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms both guidance-based techniques and conditioned models with unimodal priors, achieving superior fidelity, diversity, and controllability, even in the absence of explicit conditioning. Overall, our approach provides a more reliable and scalable solution for controllable motion generation in robotics.

Abstract: Riemannian metric learning is an emerging field in machine learning, unlocking new ways to encode complex data structures beyond traditional distance metric learning. While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.

Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical quantities of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? We argue not, based on the following observations: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the fitting target of the diffusion model's objective function degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample, which we believe hinders the model's ability to effectively learn essential statistical quantities such as posterior, score, or velocity field. 2) Most inference methods can be unified within a simple framework which involves no statistical concepts, aligns with the degraded objective function, and provides an novel and intuitive perspective on the inference process.

Abstract: Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using natural language value profiles -- descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model that estimates individual ratings from a rater representation. To measure the predictive information in a rater representation, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology and find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles, then demographics. However, value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation) and offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability. Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder predictions change in line with semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.

Abstract: We study the approximation properties of shallow neural networks whose activation function is defined as the flow map of a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) at the final time of the integration interval. We prove the universal approximation property (UAP) of such shallow neural networks in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we investigate the approximation properties of shallow neural networks whose parameters satisfy specific constraints. In particular, we constrain the Lipschitz constant of the neural ODE's flow map and the norms of the weights to increase the network's stability. We prove that the UAP holds if we consider either constraint independently. When both are enforced, there is a loss of expressiveness, and we derive approximation bounds that quantify how accurately such a constrained network can approximate a continuous function.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component and a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs.
  We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by apm allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes.
  We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 9 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 3.9x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities. However, in this work, we identify a recurring issue where these models occasionally generate overly short reasoning, leading to degraded performance on even simple mathematical problems. Specifically, we investigate how reasoning length is embedded in the hidden representations of reasoning models and its impact on accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning length is governed by a linear direction in the representation space, allowing us to induce overly short reasoning by steering the model along this direction. Building on this insight, we introduce ThinkEdit, a simple yet effective weight-editing approach to mitigate the issue of overly short reasoning. We first identify a small subset of attention heads (approximately 4%) that predominantly drive short reasoning behavior. We then edit the output projection weights of these heads to remove the short reasoning direction. With changes to only 0.2% of the model's parameters, ThinkEdit effectively reduces overly short reasoning and yields notable accuracy gains for short reasoning outputs (+6.39%), along with an overall improvement across multiple math benchmarks (+3.34%). Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into how reasoning length is controlled within LLMs and highlight the potential of fine-grained model interventions to improve reasoning quality.

We design a set of losses that ensures that these neural bases approximate fundamental physical properties such as orthogonality, divergence-free, boundary alignment, and smoothness. Our neural bases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the same fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in real-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate different domains, moving boundaries, and naturally extend to three dimensions.

Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the response, relaxing the distribution match guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft models should be corrected to preserve quality and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of AutoJudge with multiple draft/target model pairs on mathematical reasoning and programming benchmarks, achieving significant speedups at the cost of a minor accuracy reduction. Notably, on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B target model, our approach achieves up to $\approx2\times$ speedup over speculative decoding at the cost of $\le 1\%$ drop in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, AutoJudge automatically detects programming-specific important tokens, accepting $\ge 25$ tokens per speculation cycle at $2\%$ drop in Pass@1. Our approach requires no human annotation and is easy to integrate with modern LLM inference frameworks.

Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. We contribute new theoretical results, showing that NBE results in consistent estimators whose risk converges to the Bayes estimator under mild conditions. Moreover, through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling two complementary approaches to uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

Abstract: Active perception is a fundamental skill that enables us humans to deal with uncertainty in our inherently partially observable environment. For senses such as touch, where the information is sparse and local, active perception becomes crucial. In recent years, active perception has emerged as an important research domain in robotics. However, current methods are often bound to specific tasks or make strong assumptions, which limit their generality. To address this gap, this work introduces APPLE (Active Perception Policy Learning) - a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to address a range of different active perception problems. APPLE jointly trains a transformer-based perception module and decision-making policy with a unified optimization objective, learning how to actively gather information. By design, APPLE is not limited to a specific task and can, in principle, be applied to a wide range of active perception problems. We evaluate two variants of APPLE across different tasks, including tactile exploration problems from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of APPLE, achieving high accuracies on both regression and classification tasks. These findings underscore the potential of APPLE as a versatile and general framework for advancing active perception in robotics.

Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, an improved framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98$\%$, and can achieve 50$\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $<$1$\%$ rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around 40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark (MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine both absolute and relative sizes.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that scSiameseClu outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.

arXiv:2505.15441v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on seven reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities. Our framework code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/Debate-Train-Evolve

arXiv:2505.17101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoakimEdin/gim.

Abstract: The fidelity with which neural networks can now generate content such as music presents a scientific opportunity: these systems appear to have learned implicit theories of such content's structure through statistical learning alone. This offers a potentially new lens on theories of human-generated media. When internal representations align with traditional constructs (e.g. chord progressions in music), they show how such categories can emerge from statistical regularities; when they diverge, they expose limits of existing frameworks and patterns we may have overlooked but that nonetheless carry explanatory power. In this paper, focusing on music generators, we introduce a method for discovering interpretable concepts using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), extracting interpretable features from the residual stream of a transformer model. We make this approach scalable and evaluable using automated labeling and validation pipelines. Our results reveal both familiar musical concepts and coherent but uncodified patterns lacking clear counterparts in theory or language. As an extension, we show such concepts can be used to steer model generations. Beyond improving model transparency, our work provides an empirical tool for uncovering organizing principles that have eluded traditional methods of analysis and synthesis.

<title>SelfReflect: Can LLMs Communicate Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>

arXiv:2505.20295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables.

arXiv:2505.22554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective feature selection is critical for building robust and interpretable predictive models, particularly in medical applications where identifying risk factors in the most extreme patient strata is essential. Traditional methods often focus on average associations, potentially overlooking predictors whose importance is concentrated in the tails of the data distribution. In this study, we introduce a novel, computationally efficient supervised filter method that leverages the Gumbel copula's upper-tail dependence coefficient to rank features based on their tendency to be simultaneously extreme with a positive outcome. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of this method against four standard baselines (Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and L1/Elastic-Net) using four distinct classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large-scale public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a classic clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Our analysis included comprehensive statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks. On the CDC dataset, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by approximately 52% while maintaining predictive performance statistically indistinguishable from a model using all features. On the PIMA dataset, our method's feature ranking yielded the single best-performing model, achieving the highest ROC-AUC of all tested configurations. Across both datasets, the Gumbel-upper-tail dependence coefficient selector consistently identified clinically coherent and impactful predictors. We conclude that feature selection via upper-tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new tool for developing risk models in public health and clinical medicine.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value (KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand, leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV cache size by $3$-$4\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately $2\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval, reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models such as LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, and Gemma3, with context lengths reaching up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

Abstract: The per-token cost of transformer inference scales with context length, preventing its application to lifelong in-context learning. Linear attention is an efficient alternative that maintains a constant memory footprint, even on infinite context lengths. While this is a potential candidate for lifelong learning, it falls short in memory capacity. In this paper, we propose LoLA, a training-free augmentation to linear attention that boosts associative recall. LoLA distributes past key-value pairs from context into three memory systems: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window cache; (ii) difficult-to-memorize pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent hidden state of linear attention. We show through ablations that our self-recall error metric is crucial to efficiently manage long-term associative memories. On pass-key retrieval tasks, LoLA improves the base model's performance from 0.6% to 97.4% accuracy. This is achieved with a 4.6x smaller cache than Llama-3.1 8B on 4K context length. LoLA also outperforms other 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even surpasses a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on a text embedding benchmark. Lastly, we perform a variety of analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding components that are not highly relevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition.

<title>TADA: Improved Diffusion Sampling with Training-free Augmented Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms. Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally, we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional settings.

<title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In particular, the effectiveness of expected improvement (EI) has been demonstrated in a wide range of applications. However, theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared with other theoretically established algorithms. This paper analyzes a randomized variant of EI, which evaluates the EI from the maximum of the posterior sample path. We show that this posterior sampling-based random EI achieves the sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under the assumption that the black-box function follows a Gaussian process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., Persona and System Prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., Cultural, Safety, Ethics, and Fairness); and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic-centric LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in Arabic post-training dataset development.

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing-alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

<title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.

<title>Keep It Real: Challenges in Attacking Compression-Based Adversarial Purification</title>

arXiv:2508.05489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather, realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for comprehensive security evaluation.

<title>The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses</title>

arXiv:2508.08370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find that (and explain why) the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969 based on the structure of most known nuclear ground states. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses based on physics deduced by AI.

Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, use structured second-moment estimation and have attracted growing interest for their effectiveness in training neural networks (NNs). In practice, Shampoo requires step-size grafting with Adam to achieve competitive performance. SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis and further reducing per-iteration runtime. However, reliance on Adam introduces additional memory overhead in both methods. Prior theoretical interpretations have primarily examined their estimation schemes using the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the natural correspondence between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we reinterpret the estimation procedures in Shampoo and SOAP as instances of covariance estimation through the lens of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization. This perspective reveals a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivates principled improvements to their design. Building on the KL perspective, we propose practical estimation schemes -- $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$ -- that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP for pre-training various NNs while maintaining SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to achieve superior performance, thereby avoiding the associated memory overhead. Surprisingly, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms the other methods in our experiments.

Abstract: Recent works propose complex multi-modal models that handle both time series and language, ultimately claiming high performance on complex tasks like time series reasoning and cross-modal question-answering. However, they skip evaluations of simple and important foundational tasks, which complex models should reliably master. They also lack direct, head-to-head comparisons with other popular approaches. So we ask a simple question: Can recent models even produce generic visual descriptions of time series data? In response, we propose three new tasks, posing that successful multi-modal models should be able to recognize, differentiate, and generate language descriptions of time series. We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains modular modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agent development traditionally requires substantial expertise and iterative effort, often leading to high failure rates and limited accessibility. This paper introduces Agent$^2$, an LLM-driven agent-generates-agent framework for fully automated RL agent design. Agent$^2$ autonomously translates natural language task descriptions and environment code into executable RL solutions without human intervention. The framework adopts a dual-agent architecture: a Generator Agent that analyzes tasks and designs agents, and a Target Agent that is automatically generated and executed. To better support automation, RL development is decomposed into two stages, MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, facilitating targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, Agent$^2$ provides a unified framework for standardized agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC show that Agent$^2$ outperforms manually designed baselines across all tasks, achieving up to 55\% performance improvement with consistent average gains. By enabling a closed-loop, end-to-end automation pipeline, this work advances a new paradigm in which agents can design and optimize other agents, underscoring the potential of agent-generates-agent systems for automated AI development.

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.

Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.

Abstract: The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow, cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity, ``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B testing on a massive scale using real-world applications.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

<div> Rare compositions, diffusion models, Large Language Model, concept generation, R2F <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper presents a method to enhance the generation of rare compositions of concepts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by leveraging the guidance of Large Language Models (LLMs). By exposing frequent concepts relevant to the rare ones during the diffusion sampling process, the accuracy of concept composition is improved. The proposed training-free approach, R2F, plans and executes rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference using the semantic knowledge in LLMs. The framework is flexible and compatible with various pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be integrated with region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including RareBench, show that R2F outperforms existing models, such as SD3.0 and FLUX, by up to 28.1% in T2I alignment. The code for R2F is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Human Feedback, Reward Model, Optimization Perspective, Language Model
Summary:
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) success relies on the reward model quality. Despite accuracy being the primary evaluation metric, it may not fully capture a reward model's effectiveness as a teacher. The study shows that a reward model inducing low reward variance results in a flat landscape for RLHF optimization, leading to slow progress. Accurate models with low variance can underperform less accurate models with higher variance. Additionally, a reward model successful for one language model may not induce enough variance for efficient optimization in another. These findings suggest that beyond accuracy, reward models should generate sufficient variance for effective optimization. Experimental results using large language models support the theoretical conclusions, emphasizing the importance of considering reward variance in addition to accuracy when evaluating reward models for RLHF tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.

<div> Keywords: Sparse attention mechanisms, multimodal large language models, RL-based post-training framework, efficiency-accuracy trade-off, token reduction ratio

Summary:
Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead by selectively processing important tokens but plateau at moderate budgets. A new approach, Sparsity Forcing, reinforces token sparsity in multimodal large language models using a RL-based framework. It explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running rollouts with different token budgets, where efficiency and performance are jointly optimized as rewards. By rewarding more efficient and correct answers while penalizing less efficient or incorrect ones, token saving becomes an end-to-end optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing increases token reduction ratio from 20% to 75% on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL with minimal accuracy decline. This results in significantly reduced long-context inference memory and faster decoding speeds by up to 3.3 times. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, compression, reinforcement learning, dynamic adjustment, memory optimization

Summary:<br /><br />RAP is a novel framework for compressing large language models using reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust compression strategies based on runtime memory variations and heterogeneous KV-cache demands. RAP tracks the ratio between model parameters and KV-cache during execution and selectively prunes components to maximize utility within a given memory budget. By considering the different memory requirements of feed-forward networks and attention layers, RAP outperforms existing methods by optimizing model compression in real-time. This approach marks a significant advancement in model compression techniques, as it is the first to consider both model weights and KV-cache simultaneously. RAP shows promising results in experiments and offers a practical solution to deploy large language models efficiently. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.

Abstract: We propose the State Space Neural Operator (SS-NO), a compact architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation extends structured state space models (SSMs) to joint spatiotemporal modeling, introducing two key mechanisms: adaptive damping, which stabilizes learning by localizing receptive fields, and learnable frequency modulation, which enables data-driven spectral selection. These components provide a unified framework for capturing long-range dependencies with parameter efficiency. Theoretically, we establish connections between SSMs and neural operators, proving a universality theorem for convolutional architectures with full field-of-view. Empirically, SS-NO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks-including 1D Burgers' and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows-while using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches. A factorized variant of SS-NO further demonstrates scalable performance on challenging 2D problems. Our results highlight the effectiveness of damping and frequency learning in operator modeling, while showing that lightweight factorization provides a complementary path toward efficient large-scale PDE learning.

Summary:
EigenTrack is a real-time detector designed to address issues with large language models (LLMs) such as hallucination and out-of-distribution errors. It utilizes the spectral geometry of hidden activations to track temporal shifts in representation structure, indicating potential errors before they manifest. By analyzing statistics like entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines, EigenTrack offers an interpretable and efficient solution for detecting errors without the need for resampling. Unlike traditional black- and grey-box methods, EigenTrack only requires a single forward pass and preserves temporal context for accurate detection. It allows for interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs while offering a lightweight recurrent classifier for continuous monitoring of model dynamics. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Summary:
The article discusses a critical security vulnerability in current LLM unlearning methods. These methods fail to completely remove sensitive knowledge, as it can be recovered through relearning attacks. The vulnerability stems from optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points, leading to sharp minima in the loss landscape. This instability allows relearning attacks to rapidly recover supposedly erased knowledge. To address this issue, the authors propose StableUN, a feedback-guided optimization framework that prioritizes stable parameter regions. By integrating forgetting and remembering feedback, the method achieves improved robustness against relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining utility performance. Experimental results on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks support the effectiveness of StableUN.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

The study introduces the effective span dimension (ESD) as a complexity measure that considers the alignment sensitivity of kernels learned from data without the need for specific conditions. It is shown that for sequence models with an ESD of at most K, the minimax excess risk scales as σ^2 K.

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

This study investigates the susceptibility of memorization-based influence estimators to adversarial manipulation, raising concerns about their reliability.

Empirical validation on various image classification tasks demonstrates the vulnerability of state-of-the-art proxies to targeted score manipulations.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at https://github.com/tuedo2/MemAttack

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape, size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness. Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved durability and reduced internal damage.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel foundation model, TimeRCD, for time series anomaly detection (TSAD). TimeRCD differs from traditional models by using a Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) pre-training paradigm instead of reconstruction-based objectives. This approach allows TimeRCD to detect anomalies by identifying significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows, capturing contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. A large-scale synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels is used for pre-training, providing the necessary supervisory signal. Extensive experiments show that TimeRCD outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific models in zero-shot TSAD across various datasets. This validates the effectiveness of the RCD paradigm and highlights the potential for building robust and generalizable foundation models for TSAD.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Summary:<br />
The study delves into the issue of loss of plasticity in deep neural networks during deep continual learning, leading to the failure to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. The researchers pinpoint that this failure is linked to Hessian spectral collapse during new-task initialization, causing crucial curvature directions to disappear and impeding gradient descent effectiveness. They introduce the concept of $\tau$-trainability as a prerequisite for successful training, demonstrating that current plasticity-preserving algorithms align with this framework. By addressing spectral collapse directly, they propose the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, advocating for two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying L2 penalties. Experimental results on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks validate the efficacy of combining these two regularizers in preserving plasticity. <div>

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from loss of plasticity in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying L2 penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Summary: This paper introduces the concept of asymptotically optimal description length objectives for neural networks like Transformers based on Kolmogorov complexity. It shows that minimizing such objectives achieves optimal compression up to a constant for any dataset as model resources increase. The paper proves the existence of asymptotically optimal objectives for Transformers and presents a tractable and differentiable variational objective using an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior.

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled, universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

<div> autoregressive model, metal-organic frameworks, deep generative models, cheminformatics toolkit, 3D structure initialization 
Summary:<br /><br />The study introduces a two-stage framework for generating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by incorporating chemical and geometric aspects. Initially, an autoregressive model based on SMILES generates metal and organic building blocks, supported by cheminformatics tools for 3D structure initialization. Subsequently, a flow matching model predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to construct valid 3D frameworks. The framework demonstrates enhanced reconstruction accuracy, facilitates the generation of novel and distinct MOFs, and enables the creation of unique building blocks. The research addresses limitations in existing models by allowing the design of novel MOFs and the utilization of unfamiliar building blocks, offering potential advancements in MOF discovery and design.

arXiv:2505.17914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks.

Summary:  
SafeDec is a constrained decoding framework for autoregressive robot foundation models that enforces safety specifications in the form of Signal Temporal Logic formulas at inference time. This framework ensures that action trajectories generated by the models satisfy safety rules without the need for retraining, enhancing their real-world applicability. By applying SafeDec to tasks from the CHORES benchmark across various environments, the method proves effective in filtering unsafe actions and conditional action generation, without being tied to a specific policy. SafeDec bridges the gap between data-driven robotics models and the need for explicit behavioral correctness, providing a valuable solution for ensuring safety in autonomous robotic systems. <div>
arXiv:2509.01728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. Trained on vast datasets of simulated and real-world trajectories, these models map multimodal observations directly to action sequences for physical execution. Despite promising real-world capabilities, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness. We address this gap by introducing SafeDec, a constrained decoding framework for autoregressive, robot foundation models that enforces invariant safety specifications on candidate action trajectories. Task-specific safety rules are expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and are enforced at inference time with minimal overhead. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy STL specifications under assumed dynamics at runtime without retraining , while remaining agnostic of the underlying policy. We evaluate SafeDec on tasks from the CHORES benchmark for state-of-the-art generalist policies (e.g., SPOC, Flare, PoliFormer) across hundreds of procedurally generated environments and show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action generation.

Summary:
HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking) addresses the challenge of search and rescue operations by combining traversal, acquisition, and tracking in a single real-time framework. This innovative approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles to navigate unknown environments at high speed and track targets efficiently. The system defines navigation objectives based on onboard sensors, allowing for reactive flight during search operations. When a target is detected, the framework smoothly transitions to tracking mode using a perception-control pipeline. Outdoor experiments in various scenarios, including dense forests and container compounds, have demonstrated the robustness of HUNT in comparison to traditional global methods. This integrated system showcases the potential for autonomous UAV operations in challenging environments, providing crucial support in search and rescue missions.<br /><br />Summary: HUNT integrates traversal, acquisition, and tracking for search and rescue operations using UAVs, enabling high-speed flight and robust target tracking. The system defines navigation objectives based on onboard sensors, allowing for reactive flight during search operations.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.

Summary:
The research presents Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework combining motion generation and physical interaction control. Using a Transformer-based model with cross-attention, the system reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT) capturing both translational and rotational behavior. A novel quaternion noise scheduler ensures geometric consistency in rotations. An energy-based estimator updates stiffness and damping parameters based on the sZFT.

The compact model enables real-time torque control on a robotic arm. The controller successfully navigated parkour obstacles and performed peg insertions without task-specific demonstrations. This work bridges model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based trajectory generation, advancing towards Physical AI. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Summary:
Group interactions in various real-world contexts often have significant individuals known as group anchors, around whom the group is formed. This study introduces the concept of group anchors and discusses their importance in real-world interactions. The researchers developed AnchorRadar, a semi-supervised method for identifying group anchors, especially in situations with limited labeled data. Through experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, AnchorRadar demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency compared to various baselines. It achieved higher accuracy in group anchor identification, while using significantly less training time and fewer parameters on average. The results highlight the effectiveness of AnchorRadar in identifying group anchors in real-world group interactions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Despite its similarities to compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, bridging the gap between human and machine intelligence.

Summary:<br />
This study examines the impact of quantization on vision-language models like CLIP, focusing on in-distribution accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The research reveals that quantization can enhance calibration for models that are typically underconfident during pre-training, while potentially degrading it for overconfident models. Surprisingly, despite reduced calibration, OOD detection performance can still improve in some cases with quantization. The study also identifies quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that can enhance zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness simultaneously, challenging the notion of a trade-off between efficiency and performance. These findings provide valuable insights for deploying efficient, reliable, and robust vision-language models by leveraging quantization beyond its traditional role. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Neural networks can be pruned while maintaining performance, but the impact on interpretability is not well understood. This study explores the effects of magnitude-based pruning and fine-tuning on saliency maps and concept representations in a ResNet-18 model trained on ImageNette. Results show that moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while preserving distinct concepts. However, aggressive pruning leads to merging of features, reducing sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. The study suggests that pruning can enhance internal representations towards human-like attention patterns, but excessive pruning can compromise interpretability. The findings highlight the importance of balancing pruning levels to maintain both performance and interpretability in neural networks.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

<div> consolidation, lifelong learning, neural solvers, routing problems, decision-seeking <br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural solvers in solving routing problems. Traditional methods train on predefined tasks, leading to poor generalization on new tasks or catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning. The proposed framework, Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC), aims to consolidate prior knowledge by aligning behaviors with buffered decisions. It assigns greater weights to decisions with lower confidence to focus on crucial experiences. Extensive experiments on vehicle routing and traveling salesman problems show that LLR-CB effectively trains high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting. It addresses catastrophic forgetting, maintains plasticity, and improves zero-shot generalization ability. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Plantar pressure mapping is crucial for clinical diagnostics and sports science, but datasets often contain outliers. A study compared Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) with explainable machine learning for outlier detection in plantar pressure data. The machine learning model, utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), outperformed SPM in accuracy, detecting clinically meaningful variations and true outliers. Both SPM and SHAP explanations were perceived as clear, useful, and trustworthy by experts, with SPM being assessed as less complex.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.

Summary: 
Localized adversarial attacks in machine learning, specifically focusing on perturbations in specific regions of input data, were evaluated in this study. Methods such as FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W were tested for their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. Results showed that localized attacks had lower mean pixel perturbations, higher PSNR, and improved SSIM compared to global attacks. However, these benefits came with increased computational effort and a slight reduction in Attack Success Rate. Iterative methods like PGD and C&amp;W showed more robustness to localization constraints compared to single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks provides valuable insights for enhancing attack strategies and designing robust defense systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W, to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&amp;W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.

<div> Keywords: large language models, in-context learning, multitask learning, retention, continual learning

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. This study explores the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and introduces in-context continual learning (ICCL) which incorporates continual learning ability through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks show that ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) with a spacing "sweet spot" for retention, resembling human memory patterns. A human-retention similarity metric is proposed to evaluate how closely CL methods align with human retention dynamics. Linear-attention models like MAMBA and RWKV exhibit human-like retention patterns, despite Transformer-based LLMs outperforming in retention performance. ICCL emerges as a cognitively plausible and effective continual learning paradigm, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma in traditional CL methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning, with potential long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation in multitask settings. In-context continual learning introduces continual learning ability through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement, benefiting from spaced practice for retention. A human-retention similarity metric evaluates the alignment of CL methods with human memory dynamics, showing linear-attention models' human-like retention patterns. ICCL emerges as a viable continual learning paradigm, addressing stability-plasticity trade-offs in traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner, whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored. Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning (ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that, for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Summary:
Collaborative learning across different model architectures is challenging due to interoperability and privacy concerns. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by supporting model heterogeneity and enabling modular composition during inference. Clients in this framework adopt a common fusion-layer output dimension, allowing each model to be partitioned into personalized and generalized modular blocks.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning (FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across heterogeneous architectures.

<div> self-attention, relations, capacity, scaling law, multi-head attention <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) to understand the capacity of self-attention in learning relations among tokens. It formulates a capacity scaling law, showing that a key dimension $D_K$ is necessary and sufficient to recover relations in a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges. The study reveals a rationale for multi-head attention to mitigate interference and increase recoverable relations. Experimental results confirm the capacity scaling law and the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads for better performance in self-attention mechanisms. The findings offer a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and provide a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads. <div>
arXiv:2509.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges, and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target. When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m > d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads.

Summary:
An innovative black-box attack method for tabular data is introduced in this work, focusing on adversarial robustness in structured data. The approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, efficiently navigating discrete and continuous feature spaces with minimal oracle access. Through extensive experiments, it is shown that the attack successfully compromises a large portion of the test set across various models, including classical machine learning classifiers and large language model pipelines. The attack achieves high success rates above 90% consistently while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results emphasize the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, highlighting the pressing need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

<div> keywords: Margin-based optimization, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), preferences, adaptive margins, discriminative performance<br />
Summary: <br />
Margin-based optimization is essential for improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks, particularly in the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Existing methods often overlook the varying strengths of preferences, leading to suboptimal performance. This study introduces an approach that leverages preferences over preferences to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. By incorporating this ordinal signal into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the proposed DPO-PoP method demonstrates enhanced discriminative and generative performance compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on the UltraFeedback dataset showcase the superiority of the proposed method over vanilla DPO and versions with fixed or ground-truth margins. Moreover, the study highlights the tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance, emphasizing the need for balancing the correct labeling of weaker preferences with maintaining generative quality. To address this tradeoff, the authors propose two sampling strategies for gathering preference-over-preference labels, each emphasizing either discriminative or generative performance. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.

Summary:
Neighborhood sampling is essential for training large-scale graph neural networks, helping manage memory and time costs. By using neural tangent kernels, which characterize training dynamics, researchers analyzed different neighborhood sampling approaches and their corresponding Gaussian process posteriors. With limited samples, the posteriors differ but converge with increasing sample size. The posterior covariance, indicative of mean squared prediction error, is incomparable, demonstrating that no single sampling approach dominates. <div>
arXiv:2509.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the (analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance, which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods in the context of hydropower plants to improve predictive maintenance. The study addresses challenges in acoustic preprocessing under noisy conditions and extracts time- and frequency-domain features. Three machine learning models, including LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, are benchmarked on real-world datasets from a pumped-storage plant in Austria. The One-Class SVM demonstrated the best accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder showed strong detection performance (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at a higher computational cost. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of industrial factories and energy producers by enabling early detection and prevention of unplanned outages through advanced acoustic anomaly detection techniques.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then, we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational cost.

Summary:  
This study introduces an extension of Conformal Fairness (CF) to Federated Learning, aiming to address fairness concerns in machine learning models. The standard Conformal Prediction technique offers uncertainty quantification but lacks consideration of sensitive attributes. By incorporating fairness principles into CP, the new framework, CF, ensures conditional coverage guarantees across diverse subgroups. The research explores auditing federated models for fairness by examining fairness-related gaps among demographic groups. Empirical validation through experiments on various datasets in different domains demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, benefiting from the exchangeability assumption within the Federated Learning setting. This extension of CF to Federated Learning contributes to promoting fairness and accountability in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work, we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while enabling generalization to unseen data.

We evaluate our approach using several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

This article introduces a novel approach to distilling large language models (LLMs) by treating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. The method focuses on maximizing task-specific rewards while ensuring that the model does not diverge significantly from the teacher model. By adapting constrained state augmented reinforcement learning, the approach maintains constraint satisfaction without the need for state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.

<div> Keywords: Deep metric learning, MonoCon, Robust representations, Disentangled embeddings, Compact embeddings

Summary: 
MonoCon introduces a novel approach to learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations in artificial intelligence. It utilizes functional constraints, specifically employing a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. By leveraging co-adaptation between the encoder and head through contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon produces robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings with minimal performance trade-off. In experiments on the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon achieves representations that are significantly more compact and robust compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high classification accuracy. Results on an SNLI sentence similarity task further demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across different domains. The ultra-compact representations learned by MonoCon offer a unified solution to challenges in various contexts, from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Summary:<br />
Quantization-aware training (QAT) is crucial for improving quantized neural network accuracy. The optimal allocation of compute between full-precision (FP) and QAT phases is explored. Experimental data shows that the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with total compute. The tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic accurately predicts the optimal QAT fraction. A loss scaling law is derived to predict optimal QAT ratios and final performance across different strategies and quantization widths. Predictions include the optimal QAT bit width under memory constraints and comparison of QAT accuracy to FP model accuracy. A cooldown and QAT fusion approach integrates learning rate decay with QAT, saving compute by eliminating redundant FP updates. These insights provide practical guidance for efficient QAT planning and training higher-quality quantized models within the same compute budget. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from 86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide range of model sizes and quantization widths using the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget.

<div> SOAP, Adam, Shampoo, gradient whitening, neural networks <br />
Summary: <br />
The SOAP optimization algorithm, a variant of Adam and Shampoo, has shown promise in neural network training. The algorithms are analyzed in terms of gradient whitening, with their preconditioners approximating the whitening matrix. A theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo is established under certain assumptions. Empirical evaluations in language modeling and grayscale image colorization show SOAP's convergence rate is similar to Shampoo, with no significant advantage over Adam and Shampoo in final loss. These findings align with the theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo. <div>
arXiv:2509.22938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training, achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns with their equivalence in theory.

<div> quantization, language models, post-training, outliers, scales
<br />
Post-training quantization for deploying large language models at low precision faces challenges at bit-widths of 4 and below due to precision issues caused by representing outliers. The newly introduced SINQ method enhances existing quantizers by adding a second-axis scale factor and a fast algorithm to normalize variances per row and column, reducing matrix imbalance. This method is applicable to any linear layers without interactions between layers. Evaluations on Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V2.5 models show significant perplexity improvements on WikiText2 and C4 datasets compared to uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines. SINQ can be combined with calibration and non-uniform quantization for further enhancements. A code repository is available for easy implementation and reproduction of the results. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

Summary: 
Data assimilation (DA) plays a crucial role in enhancing solutions for partial differential equations (PDEs, such as those in numerical weather prediction, by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. In this study, a meta-learning framework that utilizes the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator is proposed for a family of DA problems, providing an effective initialization for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear advection equation show that the FNO-CG approach significantly reduces the average relative error by 62% and the number of iterations by 17% compared to standard CG. These improvements are particularly notable in ill-conditioned scenarios, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG for challenging DA problems. <div>

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction, by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$ compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG for challenging DA problems.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal learners for estimating conditional distributions of potential outcomes in observational data. These learners, called GDR-learners, are flexible and can utilize various deep generative models such as conditional normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. Unlike existing methods, the GDR-learners exhibit properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness, making them asymptotically optimal. Through synthetic experiments, it is demonstrated that GDR-learners are highly effective and outperform current approaches in accurately estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust) learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b) conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models (GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes.

<div> robust estimation, Generative AI, external validity, evaluation sampling bias, persona ratings

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a doubly-robust estimation framework to address evaluation sampling bias in Generative AI (GenAI) systems. External validity concerns regarding the generalization of evaluations from lab-based settings to real-world deployment conditions are addressed by combining persona ratings, produced by prompting an LLM evaluator to mimic human raters with specific characteristics, with human ratings obtained under sampling bias. The framework ensures statistically valid system quality estimates by utilizing models trained to predict human ratings from persona ratings and source data affected by sampling bias, or by employing a reweighting model to correct for bias. The effectiveness of the approach is validated theoretically and through a Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) that manipulates persona quality and evaluation bias levels. This work establishes a principled method for integrating imperfect persona ratings with human ratings to derive reliable system quality assessments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

This paper presents a novel framework for training discrete diffusion models as effective policies in complex settings with large combinatorial action spaces. The key innovation lies in an efficient online training process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By using policy mirror descent (PMD) to define a regularized target policy distribution, the policy update is framed as a distribution matching problem, enabling the diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This decoupled approach enhances training performance and stabilizes learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem, training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks, including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior performance compared to other baselines.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel off-policy actor-critic (AC) framework that tackles the challenges of instability and actor learning efficiency in off-policy RL. The framework addresses the "deadly triad" instability and the "moving target" problem by introducing functional critic modeling. The theoretical analysis in a linear function setting proves the convergence of the proposed framework, making it the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. Additionally, a neural network architecture is proposed for functional critic modeling, showcasing its effectiveness through experiments on RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark. By combining theoretical analysis with practical experimentation, the study presents a robust solution for off-policy actor-critic learning under challenging settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Summary:
In the paper "Mathematical Programming Formulation Improvement with Optimization Expertise," the authors address the challenge of automating the task of translating natural language into executable optimization models. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), current approaches struggle with accuracy due to limited and noisy training data. To enhance formulation accuracy in mixed-integer linear programming, the authors introduce a systematic approach that integrates optimization expertise. By cleaning training data and utilizing domain-informed prompting and feedback, they improve accuracy by 14 percentage points on average. This method enables LLMs to benefit from class-specific error analysis and solver feedback, leading to iterative refinement in optimization formulation. This work represents a significant step towards developing robust LLM-assisted optimization models.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however, achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average, enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called T-Tamer for efficient serving of machine learning models, especially in multi-model scenarios like cascaded models. The framework formalizes the decision process of when to exit and which model to consult, with a focus on achieving optimal performance trade-offs. The main finding is that recall, the ability to revisit earlier models, is crucial for achieving provable performance guarantees. Strategies without recall cannot approximate the optimal trade-off, while recall-based strategies can do so in polynomial time. Experimental validation on synthetic datasets and vision/NLP benchmarks demonstrates that recall-based strategies consistently deliver efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs. Overall, this work establishes a principled foundation for designing early-exit and cascaded models that bridges heuristic practices with theoretical guarantees.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency, resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and cascaded models.

Summary: 
The study introduces the variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE) as a method to improve feature organization and interpretability in neural network representations. By replacing deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporating KL divergence regularization, the vSAE aims to create more coherent feature organization in the latent space. However, evaluation on Pythia-70M transformer residual steam activations shows that the vSAE underperforms compared to a standard SAE, primarily due to excessive regularization pressure leading to a reduction in living features. While vSAE features exhibit improved robustness, they also have significantly more dead features compared to the baseline. The findings indicate that incorporating variational methods into SAEs may not necessarily enhance feature organization or interpretability.

arXiv:2509.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse, human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench, individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness, they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for calibrating multiclass predictors that output a distribution over labels. This process is challenging due to the exponential number of possible prediction values. The proposed approach defines a new calibration error that bridges two existing calibration error notions, allowing calibration across a range of interpolation. The algorithm presented can calibrate any given predictor within this range using a polynomial number of samples. Notably, the method achieves near-optimal dependence on the error parameter, surpassing previous work. A key aspect of the approach involves the application of adaptive data analysis with a high level of adaptivity but minimal overhead in sample complexity. <div>
arXiv:2509.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels, is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint, using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work. A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

<div> Keywords: neural network models, classical mechanics, Symplectic Phase Space GAN, configuration space, trajectory prediction

Summary: 
Neural network models that incorporate classical mechanics principles are crucial for understanding the dynamics of systems evolving in time and space. The Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) introduced in this paper goes beyond capturing dynamics of a single system with fixed parameters. It can handle multiple systems and generalize to unseen physical parameters without prior knowledge of the configuration space. By embedding a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone, SPS-GAN achieves physically plausible generation. Additionally, the model can discover the structure of the configuration space from various measurement types. Through optimizing the conditional time-series GAN objective with a physically motivated term, SPS-GAN encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. The utility of SPS-GAN is demonstrated in trajectory prediction, video generation, and symmetry discovery, showcasing performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

<div> Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), global sparsity level, accuracy/latency curve, efficiency targets, pretrained MoEs <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces MoE-PHDS, a method for controlling global sparsity in pretrained Mixtures of Experts models. Traditionally, training multiple models at different sparsity levels leads to increased complexity in serving, training costs, and limits flexibility. MoE-PHDS allows practitioners to adjust sparsity levels at inference time without the need for multiple models or architectural changes. By mixing training data across sparsity levels and using a short curriculum at high sparsity, MoE-PHDS creates predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs in a single model. Experimental results on various MoE models demonstrate that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement, and simplifies the deployment of MoE models by making global sparsity a primary serving parameter.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently, meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity, requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\% vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

<div> sheaf theory, topological deep learning, message passing, Hodge Laplacian, cohomology<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The essay discusses the application of sheaf theory in Topological Deep Learning (TDL), which aims to extend graph learning to more complex relational structures. It explores higher-order message passing using the Hodge Laplacian, which has biases related to combinatorial Laplacians. The essay suggests using sheaf Laplacian to enhance message passing by relating data features to sheaf cohomology. The existing sheaf diffusion theory in graph learning is examined and found lacking in generalizing to higher orders. The essay proposes novel theories and practices for higher-order settings. It also provides a comprehensive introduction to sheaves, from abstract concepts to practical applications. This approach offers a more expressive way of message passing in TDL, bridging local and global descriptors effectively. <div>
arXiv:2509.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$ (HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge (combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For $k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light -- and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the applied.

<div> Keywords: language models, geometric phases, eigenspectrum decay, autoregressive pretraining, downstream task performance <br />
Summary: 
This study explores the geometric phases of large language models during pretraining and post-training using a spectral approach. The research identifies three key phases: a "warmup" phase with rapid representational collapse, an "entropy-seeking" phase characterized by dimensional expansion and n-gram memorization, and a "compression-seeking" phase involving anisotropic consolidation. These phases result from the interplay of cross-entropy optimization and representational bottlenecks. Post-training transformations, including SFT, DPO, and RLVR, impact in-distribution performance, out-of-distribution robustness, reward alignment, and generation diversity. The study sheds light on the complex capabilities of language models and how their geometry evolves throughout the training process. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay ($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase, where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.

<div> Catastrophic interference, machine learning, latent representation learning, identification problem, shared variables <br />
Summary: 
Catastrophic interference, a common challenge in machine learning, causes trained models to forget previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that views catastrophic interference as an identification problem, quantifying forgetting as the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. By identifying shared latent variables between these setups, the forgetting phenomenon can be minimized. The proposed method, with a two-stage training strategy, uses maximum likelihood estimation to learn latent representations and optimize the KL divergence to identify shared latent variables. The approach offers both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across synthetic and benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. <div>

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Summary: 
The Sixth-Generation (6G) network aims to incorporate artificial intelligence through federated learning (FL) on edge devices. A novel FL framework is proposed in this paper, integrating personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. The framework utilizes sample-level representations and personalized DP strategies to protect training data and resist reconstruction attacks. It also implements a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm to generate locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. This personalized DP solution offers theoretical convergence guarantees and outperforms existing methods in model performance. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show a 6.82% accuracy improvement over current methods, along with reduced model size and communication cost. <div>

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\% over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10 and communication cost to 1/20.

<div> framework, jailbreak prompts, detection, filtering, graph neural networks
Summary:
GuardNet is a hierarchical filtering framework designed to detect and filter jailbreak prompts before inference in Large Language Models (LLMs). It constructs structured graphs combining sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. GuardNet utilizes graph neural networks at prompt and token levels to identify global adversarial prompts and pinpoint fine-grained adversarial spans. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over prior defenses, with prompt-level F1 scores increasing from 66.4% to 99.8% on LLM-Fuzzer and 67-79% to over 94% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, F1 scores improve from 48-75% to 74-91% with IoU gains up to +28%. Despite its complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to 74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.

<div> Transformer, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Parallel Tempering, Ising models, Integer factorization <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces IsingFormer, a Transformer model trained on equilibrium samples to generate spin configurations for use in Monte Carlo methods. IsingFormer improves mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo by providing uncorrelated samples for global moves, reducing equilibration time in 2D Ising models and enhancing search in rugged landscapes such as 3D spin glasses. The model also demonstrates success in integer factorization tasks, transferring knowledge across unseen instances and boosting success rates. IsingFormer showcases the potential of neural proposals to accelerate Monte Carlo methods, leading to faster sampling and improved performance in combinatorial optimization. <div>
arXiv:2509.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

<div> Statistical heterogeneity, data privacy, federated learning, healthcare, empirical likelihood<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated learning (FL) is being used in healthcare where data privacy is crucial. The challenge of statistical heterogeneity is addressed by proposing a new FL paradigm. The central server in this framework not only builds a model but also guides new queries to the most suitable client. An empirical likelihood-based approach is introduced to achieve two goals: creating effective local models on each client and matching new queries with the best client. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing enhancements in model accuracy and client guidance precision compared to standard FL methods. This work paves the way for more intelligent and efficient federated systems that capitalize on data heterogeneity as a strength rather than a limitation. <div>
arXiv:2509.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare, where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug.

Summary: 
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been successful in multimodal tasks but often rely heavily on their language prior (LP) instead of visual information. This study introduces a new approach to analyzing LP by investigating layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. The researchers found a consistent pattern across different models where there is a critical Visual Integration Point (VIP) where visual information starts influencing the model's behavior. They also developed the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator to quantify the strength of visual influence on response generation beyond the VIP. By examining 54 model-dataset combinations, they showed that the VIP and TVI can reliably predict the strength of the language prior in LVLMs. This analysis provides a systematic toolkit for understanding and diagnosing the influence of language prior in these models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new learning rate scheduler for neural network optimization that considers the training performance as a dynamical system. This scheduler utilizes training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process and predicts the future learning rate schedule based on long-term validation performance. The novel scheduler deviates from common parametric functions, leading to state-of-the-art results in image classification and next-token prediction tasks. Models trained with this scheduler are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape, improving generalization compared to other schedules. The method is computationally efficient, works with various optimizers, and can be easily integrated with machine learning experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of the scheduler will be released after acceptance. <div>
arXiv:2509.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions. It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be made available after acceptance.

<div> Framework, Spectral Coherence Predictability, Linear Utilization Ratio, predictability drift, model comparison

Summary:
The article introduces a novel diagnostic framework for evaluating time series forecasting models by addressing the issue of conflating a model's performance with data unpredictability. The Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP) and Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR) are introduced as metrics to measure forecasting difficulty and model effectiveness in exploiting predictable information within the data. Through this framework, the study reveals insights on predictability drift, showing that forecasting difficulty can vary over time, and highlights a key architectural trade-off between complex and linear models based on data predictability levels. The proposed framework advocates for a paradigm shift in evaluation metrics towards a more predictability-aware approach to foster fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces CLAD-Net, a framework designed to address the challenges of continual learning in human activity recognition using wearable sensors. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer for capturing global activity patterns and a supervised CNN trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. This allows the model to update continuously without sacrificing performance on past tasks. The framework achieves high accuracy on the PAMAP2 dataset with minimal forgetting, outperforming baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. CLAD-Net demonstrates robustness to label scarcity, performing well even with only 10-20% labeled data. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module in contributing to the model's performance. Overall, CLAD-Net provides a promising approach for improving continual learning in human behavior monitoring using wearable sensors. <div>
arXiv:2509.23077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions - an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net (Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer, acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels. Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

This research paper focuses on the interdependence between activation functions and weight initialization in neural networks. The study introduces a class of odd sigmoid functions and proposes a tailored initialization method for these functions to address issues such as saturation, variance collapse, and learning rate sensitivity. By selecting a noise scale in a closed form, the method ensures that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, preventing collapse to zero or saturation. The empirical results demonstrate that this approach can reliably train networks without the need for normalization layers, achieves strong data efficiency, and facilitates learning for activations that may struggle with standard initialization methods like Xavier, He, and Orthogonal. <div>

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However, activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation, variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation. Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers, exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not converge reliably.

Summary: Flow-based policies have shown promise in modeling complex behaviors in reinforcement learning. However, traditional critics bottleneck their potential by estimating a single return value. This study introduces the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), which learns the full state-action return distribution using flow matching. By transforming a simple base distribution to the target return distribution, DFC provides a rich learning signal for the flow-based policy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DFC, particularly in tasks with multimodal action distributions, and its superiority in offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods. The proposed approach paves the way for more stable and informative learning signals in reinforcement learning tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex, multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics, which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance, especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Summary:
This study investigates the latent knowledge within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) by analyzing hidden representations instead of focusing solely on task performance. The evaluation includes three parts: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Four state-of-the-art NFMs were tested on five diverse network datasets, revealing significant limitations such as anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, and an inability to separate high-level context and payload dependency. By addressing these limitations, model performance could be significantly improved without requiring architectural changes, with the potential for a +0.35 $F_1$ score improvement. <div>

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).

<div> diffusion model, score function, training, perturbations, sensitivity

Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of training a diffusion model to approximate a map from a data distribution to the optimal score function. The authors explore the possibility of differentiating this map to predict how the score and model samples would change under small perturbations to the training set. By providing a closed-form procedure for computing the map's directional derivatives, they aim to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples to perturbations of its target measure with comparable runtime to sampling. The method is designed to be robust to numerical and approximation errors, allowing for reliable predictions of changes in an image diffusion model's samples after retraining and fine-tuning. <div>

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$ to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

<div> reinforcement learning, language models, causal coherence, reward shaping, robustness

Summary:<br />
The study introduces Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a method that enhances policy optimization for large language models (LLMs) by incorporating causal coherence into the training process. By estimating model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities and counterfactually hardening these signals, CE-PO aims to reduce reward hacking and improve the robustness of LLMs to causal perturbations. The framework combines accuracy and coherence feedback using a Minkowski combiner, allowing for a trade-off between the two. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that CE-PO improves accuracy by an average of 5.49% and enhances robustness to correlation-causation flips and counterfactual edits, without sacrificing accuracy. This approach offers a promising solution to address the challenges of spurious reasoning and unfaithful chain-of-thought in LLMs trained with reinforcement objectives.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits.

<br />Summary: 
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies offer secure value transfer but also pose challenges in detecting illicit activities like money laundering. To address this, a new ensemble framework combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) has been proposed for enhancing blockchain fraud detection. Using real-world data, the ensemble model achieved high recall of fraudulent transactions with a low false positive rate, outperforming individual models and baselines. The framework includes design hooks for future integration of quantum feature mappings, enabling scalability and adaptability as quantum computing advances.

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Summary: 
The article introduces the 8-bit Muon optimizer, which utilizes blockwise quantization and supports both linear and dynamic schemes. This optimizer reduces memory usage by approximately 74% compared to full-precision Muon while maintaining stability under quantization. In various experiments, the 8-bit Muon exhibits performance on par with Muon, outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pretraining a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data. The study offers a theoretical explanation for the robustness of 8-bit Muon under quantization, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in large language model pretraining tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering $\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help explain this robustness under quantization.

<div> Keywords: human mobility, trajectory prediction, large language models, hierarchical attention, spatio-temporal modeling<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces RHYTHM, a framework for predicting human mobility using large language models (LLMs) with hierarchical temporal tokenization. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments and encodes them as tokens with hierarchical attention to capture dependencies. It enhances token representations with pre-computed prompt embeddings and frozen LLMs to capture interdependencies. By freezing the LLM's backbone, RHYTHM reduces attention complexity and memory cost. Evaluations on real-world datasets show RHYTHM achieves improved accuracy, particularly on weekends, and reduces training time significantly. The code for RHYTHM is publicly available on GitHub. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

Summary:
Impute-MACFM is a novel framework for imputing missing values in tabular data, specifically addressing longitudinal healthcare data where missing values are common. It focuses on three types of missingness mechanisms and utilizes a mask-aware conditional flow matching approach to accurately impute missing entries. The framework incorporates stability penalties on observed positions, consistency regularization for local invariance, and time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference is performed using constraint-preserving ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix observed values. Impute-MACFM outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, efficiency, and imputation quality on various benchmarks. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of flow matching techniques in dealing with tabular missing-data problems, particularly in longitudinal datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules. Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii) consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness. Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Summary:
The study introduces C$^2$GSPG, a confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method that enhances reasoning performance and reduces overconfidence in reinforcement learning models. The Group Sequence Policy Gradient framework is proposed to eliminate token-level bias common in existing methods. The model confidence for each reasoning problem is defined using normalized sequence-level probability, and a cross-entropy regularizer is used to calibrate model confidence to sequence reward. The collaborative nature of the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG is highlighted for binary rewards, with nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping utilized for non-binary rewards to address potential conflicts. Application of C$^2$GSPG to large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrates superior performance in reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration. The code for C$^2$GSPG is available at the provided GitHub repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle, we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

arXiv:2509.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

arXiv:2509.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales, layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance across diverse signal processing applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all' context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Critique to Verify: Accurate and Honest Test-Time Scaling with RL-Trained Verifiers</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults. Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1) routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on 6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive sensing.

<title>ProtoTS: Learning Hierarchical Prototypes for Explainable Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and, by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain. Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for this domain.

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models, including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size, privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated design.

<title>Bridging the Gap Between Promise and Performance for Microscaling FP4 Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23202</link>

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and 2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

<title>Towards Monotonic Improvement in In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically, we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time. Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL abilities across various tasks and environments.

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient, parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless communications, where problems require precise manipulation of information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models (0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027 problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B +81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and AIME without any training on these tasks.

<title>SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Speculative Rollouts</title>

arXiv:2509.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

<title>More Data or Better Algorithms: Latent Diffusion Augmentation for Deep Imbalanced Regression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed, and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall accuracy.

<title>Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time, strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning, shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

arXiv:2509.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development. However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information. In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2) maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and (3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing, reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from 0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3 predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age, nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values, indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is likely.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic (LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning, we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4 performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations, including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

<title>ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Two-Scale Latent Dynamics for Recurrent-Depth Transformers</title>

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance, stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

<title>MELCOT: A Hybrid Learning Architecture with Marginal Preservation for Matrix-Valued Regression</title>

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while remaining highly efficient.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

<title>Robust Fine-Tuning from Non-Robust Pretrained Models: Mitigating Suboptimal Transfer With Adversarial Scheduling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.

<title>Entering the Era of Discrete Diffusion Models: A Benchmark for Schr\"odinger Bridges and Entropic Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem. We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces. Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

<title>Landing with the Score: Riemannian Optimization through Denoising</title>

arXiv:2509.23357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms -- Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD) -- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical generative and design applications.

<title>Emergence of Superposition: Unveiling the Training Dynamics of Chain of Continuous Thought</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT) improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions. The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the growth of logits further validate our theory.

<title>Splines-Based Feature Importance in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Framework for Supervised Tabular Data Dimensionality Reduction</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures. We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$, $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression, removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

arXiv:2509.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

arXiv:2509.23405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths, planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work, we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap, we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective. Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols: cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL, HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

arXiv:2509.23410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere, preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.

<title>URS: A Unified Neural Routing Solver for Cross-Problem Zero-Shot Generalization</title>

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification, thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

arXiv:2509.23436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities. However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow. Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability. We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys) and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map. The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance. Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability and attribution accuracy.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations. PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical (BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance. To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose \textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for \emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented \emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning, \textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP) consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time. Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of modern large-scale machine learning.

<title>Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS): Scalable Surrogate-Free Multi-Agent Learning</title>

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs. We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster, has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

<title>Solve Smart, Not Often: Policy Learning for Costly MILP Re-solving</title>

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

<title>Drift-Adapter: A Practical Approach to Near Zero-Downtime Embedding Model Upgrades in Vector Databases</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23471</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations: Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving, Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems, and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

<title>Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Low-Rank Activation Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices, offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance.

<title>Statistical Learning Guarantees for Group-Invariant Barron Functions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

<title>Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

<title>Beyond Outliers: A Study of Optimizers Under Quantization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio (MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

<title>Disentanglement of Variations with Multimodal Generative Modeling</title>

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient. In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

<title>Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds, assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets -- assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs' positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

arXiv:2509.23587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank *and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus* Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant (diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the deep learning Hessian.

<title>Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

<title>Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/GraphIFE.

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a 3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets, eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face memory and PCIe latency bottlenecks when deployed on commodity hardware. Offloading expert weights to CPU memory results in PCIe transfer latency that exceeds GPU computation by several folds. We present PreScope, a prediction-driven expert scheduling system that addresses three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1) Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from computation, eliminating waiting bubbles. PreScope achieves 141% higher throughput and 74.6% lower latency than state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

<title>Beyond Greedy Exits: Improved Early Exit Decisions for Risk Control and Reliability</title>

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop (<2%) as compared to full model performance.

<title>Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation</title>

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact, knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD -> Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment must precede distillation.

<title>Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Network with Lead-Lag Structures for Stock Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

<title>Towards a Comprehensive Scaling Law of Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size ($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)). Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model design and training.

<title>Decentralized Dynamic Cooperation of Personalized Models for Federated Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features, but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging, or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features, hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and predictive across domains.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG) offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted 3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79 y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15 sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336 distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing MM.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments, many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them. We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data. This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel, task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks, SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing, and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling. Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by experimental simulation.

<title>Visual CoT Makes VLMs Smarter but More Fragile</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations, resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility. Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline, providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective, architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

<title>Enhancing LLM Steering through Sparse Autoencoder-Based Vector Refinement</title>

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

<title>STAIR: Addressing Stage Misalignment through Temporal-Aligned Preference Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g., navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.

<title>FedAgentBench: Towards Automating Real-world Federated Medical Image Analysis with Server-Client LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals), (b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6 modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium, and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for even the strongest models.

<title>Beyond the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off: A Hidden State Approach for LLM Reasoning in RLVR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV) and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

<title>Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23809</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

<title>IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric, stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target, we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

<title>Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know</title>

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured \textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single, deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space}, and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know what they don't know.

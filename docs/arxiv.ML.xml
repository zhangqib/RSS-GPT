<div> Adversarial Evolution Training, feature representations, Empirical Risk Minimization, robustness, training costs <br>
<br>
Summary: Adversarial Training (AT) is an important defense mechanism, but existing variants often overlook fundamental feature representations. The new Adversarial Evolution Training (AET) framework combines an initial Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) phase with conventional AT to cultivate a favorable feature manifold. This strategic approach leads to comparable or superior robustness achieved more quickly, improved clean accuracy, and reduced training costs by 8-25%. AET's effectiveness is demonstrated across various datasets, architectures, and in combination with established AT methods. These results highlight the significance of feature pre-conditioning through standard training for developing efficient and principled robust defenses. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets, architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the supplementary material.

<div> Keywords: Label Proportion Learning, MDPU framework, risk consistency, risk correction, generalization error bounds

Summary: 
The article introduces a new learning framework called MDPU for Label Proportion Learning (LLP) in classification tasks involving groups of instances. The framework models the distribution of instances within tuples while ensuring a balance between positive and negative instances. It proposes an unbiased risk estimator and a risk correction method to address overfitting during training. The generalization error bounds of the estimator demonstrate the consistency of the method. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the MDPU framework compared to baseline methods. This novel approach aims to better align with real-world applications where obtaining precise supervisory information is challenging and effectively leverages the proportional constraints within the data. <div>

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications, obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework \emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced, leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Summary: 
S$^2$GPT-PINN is introduced as a compact and efficient model for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). It is designed specifically for domain-specific PDE families, utilizing a small amount of high-quality data through a mathematical greedy algorithm. The model relies on minimal parameters compared to traditional PINNs, achieving high efficiency through customizations. Knowledge distillation is performed through task-specific activation functions transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs, while a strategic down-sampling technique compresses the physics-informed loss calculation to significantly reduce the number of data sites. This dual customization approach enables S$^2$GPT-PINN to efficiently solve parametric PDEs with minimal computational resources. <div>

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs), S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power. Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models, S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in terms of prediction accuracy.

<title>BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Rotational quantization, large language models, bias correction, asymmetric scaling, blockwise optimization

Summary:
BASE-Q is a novel approach introduced to improve rotational quantization methods for large language models. The limitations of current rotational quantization techniques are identified, including the failure to align channel means and the increase in clipping errors due to a Gaussian-like activation distribution caused by rotation. BASE-Q addresses these issues by combining bias correction and asymmetric scaling, reducing rounding and clipping errors. Additionally, BASE-Q allows for blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Experimental results show significant improvements in narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models compared to existing methods. Specifically, BASE-Q achieves a 50.5% improvement over QuaRot, 42.9% over SpinQuant, and 29.2% over OSTQuant. The code for BASE-Q will be made available soon. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics (LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

Summary: 
This paper explores the issue of whether latent action models (LAMs) capture relevant changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise in video frames. Analyzing a linear model that mimics LAM learning, the study reveals connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA) and the importance of the data-generating policy. Strategies like data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action prediction are justified to focus on learning controllable changes. The research includes numerical simulations to demonstrate the impact of observation, actions, and noise structure on LAM learning. <div>
arXiv:2506.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However, differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations, actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench, significantly outperforming the best alternative.

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods, such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

Results surpassed other optimization methods such as grid search and Bayesian optimization. Kernel PCA identified nonlinear relationships, enhancing classification accuracy. The parallel MIGA significantly reduced tuning time, leading to optimal accuracy scores. This integrated framework offers a promising approach for disease classification tasks.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100% for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods, such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models, which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator, executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation.

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients. Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis, epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota results. Codes will be released.

Summary: 
Spotscape introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships between multiple spots in Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) data. This addresses the limitation of existing methods in representing spots near spatial domain boundaries effectively. Additionally, the framework proposes a similarity scaling strategy to regulate distances between spots within the same slice and across slices, enabling efficient multi-slice integration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of Spotscape in various downstream tasks in both single-slice and multi-slice scenarios. The code for Spotscape is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and validation. Overall, Spotscape offers a promising solution for analyzing complex biological networks with spatial context, providing valuable insights for researchers in the field of transcriptomics.

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains. However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice and multi-slice scenarios.

Summary:<br>
Machine unlearning is crucial for enhancing the safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post-deployment. The current benchmarks for LLM unlearning lack a balance between forget and retain sets, leading to vulnerabilities and potential relearning attacks on supposedly unlearned knowledge. To address this issue, the BLUR benchmark was introduced, offering more realistic scenarios with extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying difficulty levels. Evaluation on BLUR shows a significant drop in performance for existing unlearning methods, with simpler approaches outperforming recent methods. These results underscore the need for robust evaluation methods and suggest important avenues for future research in machine unlearning. The BLUR benchmark is publicly accessible for further study and development. <br> <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets -- painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present $\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on $\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and suggest several important directions of future study.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) and proposes a novel algorithm called Contraction Actor-Critic (CAC) that integrates CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL) to provide dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies. CAC enhances the capability of CCMs by simultaneously learning a contraction metric generator (CMG) and optimizing tracking policies under unknown dynamics. The algorithm aims to minimize cumulative tracking errors while ensuring long-term optimality in a fully automated setting. By combining contraction theory with RL, CAC addresses the limitations of traditional CCMs, such as the need for a known dynamics model and scalability to complex systems with uncertainty. Empirical studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAC compared to existing baselines, highlighting the potential of integrating contraction theory into RL for improved control synthesis in complex systems. <div>

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm, called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1 features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization.

Summary:
Minifinetuning (MFT) is a new method for domain adaptation of language models that reduces the negative impact of overfitting-induced degeneralization, particularly in low-data scenarios. It outperforms standard finetuning by achieving more favorable specialization-to-degeneralization ratios, even with minimal data resources in the new domain. MFT utilizes individualized corrective self-distillation on the sample level, showcasing robustness to overfitting with as little as 500 samples. It surpasses parameter-efficient finetuning methods, offers degeneralization mitigation similar to replay techniques, and can be combined with other methods for enhanced performance. MFT presents a promising approach for improving language model adaptation to new domains with limited data availability. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500 samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with either for a combined effect.

Summary: 
The paper introduces FIMCFG, a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering method that addresses the limitations of existing federated multi-view clustering methods. FIMCFG utilizes a dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract global and view-specific features. These features are fused with the guidance of a fused graph, enabling effective clustering under pseudo-labeling supervision. The high-level features generated are then uploaded to the server for refinement of graph fusion and pseudo-labeling computation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FIMCFG in handling missing data and leveraging global information for improved clustering performance in federated multi-view settings. The proposed method is publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of underlying features containing global and view-specific information. Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

Summary:
LFPS is a novel method designed to address the memory demand bottleneck faced by large language models during decoding. By leveraging historical attention patterns, LFPS dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates based on vertical and slash patterns observed in decoder attention. Through a positional expansion strategy, LFPS efficiently predicts the Top-k indices for each decoding step, significantly reducing computational and data transfer overhead. Experimental results on challenging long-context benchmarks validate LFPS's effectiveness, showcasing up to a 22.8× speedup over full attention and a 9.6× speedup over exact Top-k retrieval. This acceleration method maintains generation accuracy while offering practical and efficient decoding optimization for long-context LLM inference. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns (attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$ speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively, while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in long-context LLM inference.

Summary:<br>
This study explores the zero-shot forecasting capabilities of TSFMs for macroeconomic indicators without the need for custom econometric models or extensive training datasets. Three advanced TSFMs were tested on a case study dataset and found to effectively capture economic dynamics and handle structural breaks. Results show that TSFMs perform well without fine-tuning during stable economic periods, matching or surpassing traditional models. However, they may experience reduced performance during sudden shocks. The study provides insights on when zero-shot TSFMs are suitable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning.

Summary:
<Br><br>Mathematical reasoning challenges LLMs, requiring correct reasoning steps. DPO aligns human intent using preference data but struggles in long-chain math problems. MDPO optimizes LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and Step2Step, improving long-chain reasoning. Training objectives are unified to align with generation metrics. Experiments on Qwen2 and Llama3 models show significant performance improvements on GSM8K and MATH datasets compared to DPO and other variants.

arXiv:2506.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step. Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps; Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset, outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not require manual annotation costs.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

The article introduces a new framework, Causal Graphs for Brains (CGB), for brain disease classification using graph neural networks (GNNs). CGB considers the causal relationship between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains, utilizing the transfer entropy method to uncover cause and effect interactions. By generating refined brain networks based on causal discovery and geometric curvature strategy, CGB enhances brain disease classification performance by revealing essential causal relationships between ROIs. Additionally, CGB incorporates graph rewiring to improve the expressiveness of the causal graph and reduce potential information bottlenecks when modeled by GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGB outperforms existing methods in brain disease classification tasks, as measured by average F1 scores. <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs, which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy. CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Summary: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but its resource-intensive nature limits its scalability. A new method called RAST is proposed to transfer the reasoning behaviors induced by RL training on a small model to larger base models. Token-level analysis confirms that RL-induced probability adjustments are consistent across model scales. RAST significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of base models across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks while requiring lower GPU memory compared to direct RL training. The findings suggest that RL primarily reshapes the output distribution of models rather than imparting new knowledge, providing insights into scaling the benefits of RL-driven reasoning efficiently. RAST offers a practical strategy to enhance reasoning capabilities without the full computational cost of direct RL training.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge; rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without incurring its full computational cost.

<div> Framework, federated learning, privacy leakage, gradient inversion attacks, defense mechanism
Summary:
The article introduces a framework for addressing privacy leakage in federated learning by leveraging a shadow model to identify sensitive areas in images. This targeted approach allows for sample-specific noise injection, improving privacy protection without significantly impacting model accuracy. The defensive strategy achieves notable improvements in PSNR and SSIM compared to scenarios without defense on medical image datasets such as ChestXRay and EyePACS. Additionally, it minimizes F1 reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive information. The proposed framework offers a universal defense against various types of gradient inversion attacks, particularly focusing on protecting sensitive areas within images. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently demonstrated across diverse types of medical images, validating the generalization of the approach. <div>
arXiv:2506.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries. Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images, thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients, yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover, it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1 reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over 1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel framework that utilizes BERT-style pretraining for accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries. By customizing BERT with a time-series-to-token representation module and a point-MSM pretraining task, the model learns from sequential battery data, generating robust temporal embeddings. These embeddings, combined with battery metadata, are fed into a classifier for fault classification. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the pretrained models, achieving a high AUROC of 0.945 and surpassing existing methods. This approach showcases the potential of leveraging large language models for time-series fault detection in industrial applications. <div>

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems. However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM) pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification. Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945 and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering. While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses. This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver, trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods. The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility, demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational decision-making in offshore environments.

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform (STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103, Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of self-attention.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression (SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: citizens' assemblies, deliberative democracy, dropout probabilities, alternate selection, representation

Summary: 
An optimization framework is introduced for selecting alternates in citizens' assemblies to address the issue of participant attrition and unbalanced composition. The algorithm leverages learning-theoretic techniques to estimate dropout probabilities and minimize expected misrepresentation. The approach offers theoretical guarantees, including bounds on sample complexity and loss in case of mis-estimation of dropout probabilities. Empirical evaluation using real-world data shows that the method significantly improves representation with fewer alternates needed compared to the existing methods. The legitimacy of citizens' assemblies in deliberative democracy relies on their representation of the broader population, making the accurate selection of alternates crucial for maintaining diversity and inclusivity in decision-making processes. <div>

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions. The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition. Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap, we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach, including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves representation while requiring fewer alternates.

arXiv:2506.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model. However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's -31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model (14.0% win rate).

Summary: BuildingBRep-11K is a dataset of 11,978 multi-storey buildings generated using a shape-grammar-driven pipeline. Each building includes geometrically exact B-rep solid covering floors, walls, slabs, and rule-based openings, along with detailed metadata. The dataset incorporates constraints on spatial scale, daylight optimization, and interior layout to ensure compliance with architectural standards. Two lightweight PointNet baselines were trained on the dataset: multi-attribute regression and defect detection. The regression model achieved good results in predicting storey count, total rooms, and mean room area. The defect detection model performed well in classifying good versus defective buildings. These results demonstrate that BuildingBRep-11K is learnable and suitable for both geometric regression and topological quality assessment.<br> <div>

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors) buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale, daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i) Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100 unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \% precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological quality assessment

Summary: <br>
This paper introduces a novel approach to optimize hot water production in households using a combination of machine learning (ML) and anomaly detection. By implementing a composite approach of ML and isolation forest (iForest), the system forecasts household hot water demand and guides heat pump operations accordingly. Advanced time-series analysis and feature selection techniques are used to capture complex usage patterns. Three ML models - Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with self-attention mechanism - are applied and tuned on data from real heat pump installations. Experimental validation on six households shows that LightGBM outperforms LSTM variants, with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37%. The iForest anomaly detection achieves an F1-score of 0.87 with a low false alarm rate of 5.2%, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world heat pump deployments. <div>

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications, optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4) experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance, with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$ values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\%, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP deployments.

Summary:
Tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE) is proposed for few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL), updating the entire model with few examples. The method interpolates base, previous, and current models in weight-space, maintaining knowledge while addressing overfitting. A regularization loss term using amplified data knowledge distillation tackles the challenge of distilling representations from scarce data. By intermixing few-shot data, richer data is produced for distillation. State-of-the-art results are achieved on miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base, immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Summary: 
Bohdi is a novel framework for Heterogeneous Large Language Model fusion that utilizes synthetic data only. It organizes knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, allowing for automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through collaboration of multiple models. By treating domain expansion and data allocation as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi employs the DynaBranches mechanism to adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Additionally, the Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism facilitates tracking capability shifts during updates through Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT). Experimental results demonstrate that Bohdi outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, showing higher data efficiency and mitigating capability imbalances. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bohdi in leveraging synthetic data for knowledge extraction in heterogeneous LLM fusion.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices. In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved, i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore, there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE, which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at https://github.com/wzhan24/UniMate.

<div> adaptation, modality, key-value cache, multimodal, attention heads
<br>
MadaKV is introduced as a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache eviction strategy for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance efficiency in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios, attention heads across MLLMs show varied preferences for different modalities, leading to disparities in modality importance. Traditional KV cache eviction methods designed for unimodal settings struggle to capture modality-specific information, resulting in suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV significantly reduces KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency. Experimental results on representative MLLMs and the MileBench benchmark show that MadaKV outperforms existing KV cache eviction methods, achieving 1.3 to 1.5 times improvement in decoding latency while maintaining high accuracy across various multimodal long-context tasks.

Summary: 
In the paper "Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)", the authors introduce a new model called GrIDDD that addresses the limitation of existing graph diffusion models. GrIDDD supports the dynamic growth or shrinkage of chemical graphs during the generation process, allowing for size-adaptive molecular generation. The model achieves impressive results in molecular property targeting and optimization tasks, outperforming existing models trained on similar problems. By enabling the insertion and deletion of nodes in a graph, GrIDDD offers a more flexible and effective approach to molecular generation. This work represents a significant step towards improving conditional generation scenarios in molecular design, with potential applications in drug discovery and materials science.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms) during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design, where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Summary: CheMeleon is a new molecular foundation model that utilizes deterministic molecular descriptors for accurate property prediction. It outperforms baseline models like Random Forest and Chemprop on benchmark datasets, achieving high win rates on both Polaris and MoleculeACE tasks. While effective at capturing structural nuances and separating chemical series, CheMeleon struggles with distinguishing activity cliffs. The model is pre-trained on low-noise descriptors, enabling training on small datasets and offering potential for scalable and accurate molecular property prediction. This approach highlights the importance of using noise-free descriptors for machine learning in chemical research, opening up opportunities for further exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled data. <br> <div>

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks, outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop (36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%) and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series, highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability, demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel algorithm, FedWB, for model fusion in a distributed setting using Wasserstein barycenters. The algorithm involves dividing the dataset among "agents" with identical deep neural networks, training locally, and aggregating weights through Wasserstein barycenters. Additionally, the algorithm is extended to address Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Experimental validation on the CartPole toy problem demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach where varying pole lengths create heterogeneous environments. Training deep Q-Networks in each environment and performing global aggregation steps result in a global DQN capable of functioning across all environments. The proposed algorithm showcases the power of leveraging Wasserstein barycenters for model fusion in distributed architectures and heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a global DQN that functions across all environments.

Summary:
Effective large-scale air quality monitoring requires distributed sensing due to the widespread presence of harmful particulate matter in urban areas. While accurate sensors are costly and limit coverage, low-cost sensors are prone to drift. This paper introduces a model for in-field sensor calibration using XGBoost ensemble learning, which combines data from neighboring sensors to reduce reliance on individual sensor accuracy and improve generalization across locations. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this approach offers a more cost-effective and reliable method for enhancing air quality monitoring in urban environments. <div>

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM), particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and improves generalization across different locations.

Summary:
This study explores the calibration of modern neural networks (NNs) in comparison to human perceptual uncertainty. While NNs often achieve high accuracy, they tend to be poorly calibrated, leading to overconfident incorrect predictions. The researchers investigate the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and human-perceived uncertainty across three vision benchmarks. Results indicate a weak alignment between the two, varying significantly across tasks and uncertainty metrics. Interestingly, incorporating human-derived soft labels during training improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy. This study highlights the persistent gap between model and human uncertainty estimation and suggests the potential for integrating human insights to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong. This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

Summary: <br>
Rectified Flow is a method for generative modeling that learns a velocity field, but it can face issues with boundary conditions. In the proposed Boundary RF Model, boundary conditions are enforced to improve accuracy near boundaries during stochastic sampling. This modification leads to better performance compared to the vanilla RF model, with an 8.01% FID score improvement on ImageNet using ODE sampling and an 8.98% improvement using SDE sampling. By addressing the limitations of directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural network, the Boundary RF Model enhances the quality of generative modeling results and ensures that the velocity field estimations align more closely with the desired ODE. <div>

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary. To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model, demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and 8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

Summary:
Loss curves in model training are typically smooth, making visible discontinuities potential breakthroughs in understanding learning dynamics. This paper introduces POLCA, a method for identifying hidden transitions in loss by decomposing changes along different bases of the low-rank training subspace. By using POLCA, clusters of samples with similar changes in loss can be identified, revealing smaller groups of conceptually similar data that represent interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. The method is validated on synthetic arithmetic and natural language tasks, showcasing its ability to uncover hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised interpretability. Overall, the study highlights the importance of properly identifying and studying hidden breakthroughs in loss during model training to deepen understanding of learning dynamics.

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised interpretability.

Summary:
SHRED models use RNNs and MLP for temporal encoding and spatial decoding to predict chaotic dynamical systems from sparse sensor data. T-SHRED improves performance by incorporating transformers for temporal encoding and adding a SINDy attention mechanism for symbolic regression in the latent space. This allows for improved interpretability and regularization of the model during training. The enhanced T-SHRED model is tested on various dynamical systems across different data regimes and shows accurate prediction of future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model. <div>

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops. SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture. Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model across all tested datasets.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels. This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly, we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the classical model of self-directed learning.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques. Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process, we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff. Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three evaluation metrics and datasets.

Abstract: Background: Patients with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and atrial fibrillation (AF) face elevated mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet models targeting this high-risk group remain limited.
  Objective: To develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model predicting 28-day mortality in ICU patients with concurrent DM and AF using early-phase clinical data.
  Methods: A retrospective cohort of 1,535 adult ICU patients with DM and AF was extracted from the MIMIC-IV database. Data preprocessing involved median/mode imputation, z-score normalization, and early temporal feature engineering. A two-step feature selection pipeline-univariate filtering (ANOVA F-test) and Random Forest-based multivariate ranking-yielded 19 interpretable features. Seven ML models were trained with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and SMOTE oversampling. Interpretability was assessed via ablation and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) analysis.
  Results: Logistic regression achieved the best performance (AUROC: 0.825; 95% CI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS, age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots showed intuitive, non-linear effects such as age-related risk acceleration and bilirubin thresholds.
  Conclusion: This interpretable ML model offers accurate risk prediction and clinical insights for early ICU triage in patients with DM and AF.

Abstract: We introduce a large-scale dataset for instruction-guided vector image editing, consisting of over 270,000 pairs of SVG images paired with natural language edit instructions. Our dataset enables training and evaluation of models that modify vector graphics based on textual commands. We describe the data collection process, including image pairing via CLIP similarity and instruction generation with vision-language models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art large language models reveal that current methods struggle to produce accurate and valid edits, underscoring the challenge of this task. To foster research in natural language-driven vector graphic generation and editing, we make our resources created within this work publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design, enabling the reuse of prior solutions to reduce engineering effort and turnaround time. We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible, here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders. With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under 1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity (PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges, enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue. Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret, elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

<title>CORAL: Disentangling Latent Representations in Long-Tailed Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings, multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>On the optimal regret of collaborative personalized linear bandits</title>

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents, the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret. We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$, $\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma} \sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$ respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast, agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks, focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods, we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository is available at https://github.com/baunilhamarga/critical-periods

<title>On the Theoretical Understanding of Identifiable Sparse Autoencoders and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3) enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3) multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at https://github.com/lizzyhku/Autotime.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals, including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing generalizable brain foundation models powered by self-supervision.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

<title>A Scalable Factorization Approach for High-Order Structured Tensor Recovery</title>

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures, and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML), especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data, features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented, relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools. This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts: Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions, enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across the ML lifecycle.

<title>CRIA: A Cross-View Interaction and Instance-Adapted Pre-training Framework for Generalizable EEG Representations</title>

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting its strong generalization ability.

<title>Floating-Point Neural Networks Are Provably Robust Universal Approximators</title>

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net), where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS) demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding. Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover, CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency. Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move beyond surface-level behavior supervision.

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.

<title>Mitigating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks by Spectrum-Preserving Sparsification</title>

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as \textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring}, which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language. Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality. The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The error function is informal but still works for our case.

<title>Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Soft Prompt Transfer for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally, soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider. For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs, preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods that do not account for wireless optimization.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM noise.

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler, the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations. While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions, heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands, making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias. To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference, though challenges remain.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents (especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste, let's talk about " with uninterrupted accent shifts while preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement, with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and efficiency.

Automatic anomaly detection is no exception to this rule, and quite often the astronomer is left to independently analyze the data in order to understand why a given event is tagged as an anomaly. We introduce here idea of anomaly signature, whose aim is to help the interpretability of anomalies by highlighting which features contributed to the decision.

The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building. Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly, domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation, preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and cost-effective building energy management.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for monitoring cattle behavior and detecting estrus (heat) periods using sensor data and machine learning. We designed and deployed a low-cost Bluetooth-based neck collar equipped with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to capture real-time behavioral data from real cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination, lying, and others. We evaluated multiple machine learning models -- Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) -- for behavior classification. Additionally, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for estrus detection using behavioral patterns and anomaly detection. Our system achieved over 93% behavior classification accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy on a limited test set. The approach offers a scalable and accessible solution for precision livestock monitoring, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system dynamics.

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem, especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large, pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space, which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only $\sim$45% of the best competitor.

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however, directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation for future research in directed graph generation.

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs), yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to \textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii) robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing LLMs. Our project is available at \href{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model deployment.

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

This work presents an innovative collision avoidance system utilizing event-based cameras - a novel imaging technology well-suited for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Space Traffic Management (STM).

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data -- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI), approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks, demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model that can perform EEG-based emotion recognition in a real-life context, we propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters. Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2 fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and scalability with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the target task's distribution.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail. Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96% and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond cardiology.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors, leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically, Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N, across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat, chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility, especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility, and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance, and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large language models

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP) extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression). We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency, making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings. Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors. We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance across both single-task and multi-task settings.

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches, FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However, incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges, specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive federated learning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience. Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns, and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

<title>Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic: Shifting the Agent-Environment Boundary for Diverse Action Spaces</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous, regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.). Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC). Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

<title>A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning</title>

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in $\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better sample complexity, and is simpler.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) - a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data, relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii) the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models that can transform the processing of relational data.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces. This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1) column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights, we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition, our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer design.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information, including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP) provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable, consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence, particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules, auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4) events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead. However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience against client-side privacy attacks.

<title>On Training-Test (Mis)alignment in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization: Observation, Empirical Exploration, and Analysis</title>

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance, starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods. Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases. We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving $o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2 (sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force). Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7% on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways, quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers, highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

<title>Off-Policy Actor-Critic for Adversarial Observation Robustness: Virtual Alternative Training via Symmetric Policy Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary, making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem. Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

<title>Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding</title>

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

<title>What Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16782</link>

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits, such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g., economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups -- and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals (i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML pipeline.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce \underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace. Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

<title>Exploring and Improving Initialization for Deep Graph Neural Networks: A Signal Propagation Perspective</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation, backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

<title>Robust Group Anomaly Detection for Quasi-Periodic Network Time Series</title>

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e. new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been investigated.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices. Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns, regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast, Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data, heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications. Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent, while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and it is available as open-source at: https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/baselines/fedfittech

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators (KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs. To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data. In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule, highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15 well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended to consider group fairness.

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network, specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning. We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of scale and feature learning in continual learning.

<title>From Lab to Factory: Pitfalls and Guidelines for Self-/Unsupervised Defect Detection on Low-Quality Industrial Images</title>

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse, often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000 births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4 million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%. Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression. These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive ensembling with tractable complexity.

<title>Latent Concept Disentanglement in Transformer-based Language Models</title>

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core, latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent concepts in ICL tasks.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge, recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering. They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue, we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks. Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation. Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution. U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics, which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges, this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability. Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods. When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than that of conventional methods.

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness" remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally) against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric, revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful metrics.

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.

<title>MAWIFlow Benchmark: Realistic Flow-Based Evaluation for Network Intrusion Detection</title>

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1 dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011, 2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and reproducibility.

<title>Navigating the Deep: Signature Extraction on Deep Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2506.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer. Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However, their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction. Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

<title>From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters. We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for it to reach its maximum.

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First, the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution, the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model, consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings. Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline algorithm.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both: a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective generative modeling techniques.

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects. While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors. DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii) a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled representations in multi-condition settings.

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points. In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of the true underlying parameter.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios, demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

<title>BREAD: Branched Rollouts from Expert Anchors Bridge SFT &amp; RL for Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors, especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.

<title>No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap, we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation- and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks.

Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data, the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still possible to build effective models of real property markets.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective with increasing beam width.

<title>The Safety Reminder: A Soft Prompt to Reactivate Delayed Safety Awareness in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature, allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed ``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility, offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength (activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency, highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation effectiveness and fluency.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena, the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

The algorithm is a pathspace Metropolis-adjusted manifold sampling scheme, which samples stochastic paths on the submanifold of realizations that adhere to the conditioning constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by sampling a dynamical condensation phase transition, conditioning a random walk on a fixed Levy stochastic area, conditioning a stochastic nonlinear wave equation on high amplitude waves, and sampling a stochastic partial differential equation model of turbulent pipe flow conditioned on relaminarization events.

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance. Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$. Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future investigations into designing variable system prompts.

Abstract: In this letter, we propose Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient (QPPG), a natural gradient-based algorithm for link adaptation that whitens policy updates using the full inverse quantum Fisher information with Tikhonov regularization. QPPG bridges classical and quantum geometry, achieving stable learning even under noise. Evaluated on classical and quantum environments, including noisy single-qubit Gym tasks and Rayleigh-fading channels, QPPG converges 4 times faster than REINFORCE and sustains a 1 dB gain under uncertainty. It reaches a 90 percent return in one hundred episodes with high noise robustness, showcasing the advantages of full QFI-based preconditioning for scalable quantum reinforcement learning.

We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al., 2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks effectively.

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient deployment.

Abstract: This paper discusses the compilation, optimization, and error mitigation of quantum algorithms, essential steps to execute real-world quantum algorithms. Quantum algorithms running on a hybrid platform with QPU and CPU/GPU take advantage of existing high-performance computing power with quantum-enabled exponential speedups. The proposed approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) for quantum algorithm optimization improves the circuit execution on top of an exponential speed-ups the quantum Fourier transform has provided.

<title>Implicit neural representations for accurate estimation of the standard model of white matter</title>

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature, extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then, accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs), which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials, supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise, supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.

Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of the complex structure parameter.

<title>Superconducting Qubit Readout Using Next-Generation Reservoir Computing</title>

Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck. Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation, adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets, respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum processors.

<title>Convergent Methods for Koopman Operators on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>

Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions. However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in $L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms. Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging, high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow, molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.

Abstract: Computer graphics, often associated with films, games, and visual effects, has long been a powerful tool for addressing scientific challenges--from its origins in 3D visualization for medical imaging to its role in modern computational modeling and simulation. This course explores the deep and evolving relationship between computer graphics and science, highlighting past achievements, ongoing contributions, and open questions that remain. We show how core methods, such as geometric reasoning and physical modeling, provide inductive biases that help address challenges in both fields, especially in data-scarce settings. To that end, we aim to reframe graphics as a modeling language for science by bridging vocabulary gaps between the two communities. Designed for both newcomers and experts, Graphics4Science invites the graphics community to engage with science, tackle high-impact problems where graphics expertise can make a difference, and contribute to the future of scientific discovery.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Piecewise-constant regression trees remain popular for their interpretability, yet often lag behind black-box models like Random Forest in predictive accuracy. In this work, we introduce TRUST (Transparent, Robust, and Ultra-Sparse Trees), a novel regression tree model that combines the accuracy of Random Forests with the interpretability of shallow decision trees and sparse linear models. TRUST further enhances transparency by leveraging Large Language Models to generate tailored, user-friendly explanations. Extensive validation on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that TRUST consistently outperforms other interpretable models -- including CART, Lasso, and Node Harvest -- in predictive accuracy, while matching the accuracy of Random Forest and offering substantial gains in both accuracy and interpretability over M5', a well-established model that is conceptually related.

<title>Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown, treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto (HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and practical coding performance.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text, enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Fairness is desirable yet challenging to achieve within multi-agent systems, especially when agents differ in latent traits that affect their abilities. This hidden heterogeneity often leads to unequal distributions of wealth, even when agents operate under the same rules. Motivated by real-world examples, we propose a framework based on repeated principal-agent games, where a principal, who also can be seen as a player of the game, learns to offer adaptive contracts to agents. By leveraging a simple yet powerful contract structure, we show that a fairness-aware principal can learn homogeneous linear contracts that equalize outcomes across agents in a sequential social dilemma. Importantly, this fairness does not come at the cost of efficiency: our results demonstrate that it is possible to promote equity and stability in the system while preserving overall performance.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), but scaling probabilistic neural operators such as the recently proposed Gaussian Processes Operators (GPOs) to high-dimensional, data-intensive regimes remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel, scalable GPO, which capitalizes on sparsity, locality, and structural information through judicious kernel design. Addressing the fundamental limitation of cubic computational complexity, our method leverages nearest-neighbor-based local kernel approximations in the spatial domain, sparse kernel approximation in the parameter space, and structured Kronecker factorizations to enable tractable inference on large-scale datasets and high-dimensional input. While local approximations often introduce accuracy trade-offs due to limited kernel interactions, we overcome this by embedding operator-aware kernel structures and employing expressive, task-informed mean functions derived from neural operator architectures. Through extensive evaluations on a broad class of nonlinear PDEs - including Navier-Stokes, wave advection, Darcy flow, and Burgers' equations - we demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves high accuracy across varying discretization scales. These results underscore the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between scalability and fidelity in GPO, offering a compelling foundation for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls. Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University (2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years) and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98 mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86 (controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and 0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 = 0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability. Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset, are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free pediatric pancreatic imaging and fostering collaborative research in this underserved domain.

Abstract: Contactless manipulation of small objects is essential for biomedical and chemical applications, such as cell analysis, assisted fertilisation, and precision chemistry. Established methods, including optical, acoustic, and magnetic tweezers, are now complemented by flow control techniques that use flow-induced motion to enable precise and versatile manipulation. However, trapping multiple particles in fluid remains a challenge. This study introduces a novel control algorithm capable of steering multiple particles in flow. The system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields that transport particles to precise locations. Disk rotations are governed by a feedback control policy based on the Optimising a Discrete Loss (ODIL) framework, which combines fluid dynamics equations with path objectives into a single loss function. Our experiments, conducted in both simulations and with the physical device, demonstrate the capability of the approach to transport two beads simultaneously to predefined locations, advancing robust contactless particle manipulation for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify, a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities. To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task. Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Data-Agnostic Cardinality Learning from Imperfect Workloads</title>

Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization. Traditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However, organizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data access. Fortunately, query-driven cardinality estimation can learn CardEst models using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often require access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume perfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join graphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join templates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic cardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world constraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates and is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new per-table CardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and a novel learned count sketch model that captures join correlations across base relations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP consistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads, both in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches built over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark -- despite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible join templates.

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages, making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream (problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and evaluation pipeline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework tailored for complex question answering tasks, addressing challenges in multi-hop reasoning and contextual understanding across lengthy documents. Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with advanced context fusion and multi-hop reasoning mechanisms, enabling more accurate and coherent response generation. A joint optimization strategy combining retrieval likelihood and generation cross-entropy improves the model's robustness and adaptability. Experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms existing retrieval-augmented and generative baselines, confirming its effectiveness in delivering precise, contextually grounded answers.

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete. To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than necessary.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model (LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling, which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem, adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system, enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion. This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3) full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control. These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.

Abstract: Score-based methods have recently seen increasing popularity in modeling and generation. Methods have been constructed to perform hypothesis testing and change-point detection with score functions, but these methods are in general not as powerful as their likelihood-based peers. Recent works consider generalizing the score-based Fisher divergence into a diffusion-divergence by transforming score functions via multiplication with a matrix-valued function or a weight matrix. In this paper, we extend the score-based hypothesis test and change-point detection stopping rule into their diffusion-based analogs. Additionally, we theoretically quantify the performance of these diffusion-based algorithms and study scenarios where optimal performance is achievable. We propose a method of numerically optimizing the weight matrix and present numerical simulations to illustrate the advantages of diffusion-based algorithms.

Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks, modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576 modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning in black-box optimization.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction (CP) under geometric data shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations or flips. While CP endows prediction models with post-hoc uncertainty quantification and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under distribution shifts that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue, we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose. Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven, rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex, multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end, we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training, with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of natural language processing (NLP)-based n-gram analysis and machine learning techniques to enhance malware classification. We explore how NLP can be used to extract and analyze textual features from malware samples through n-grams, contiguous string or API call sequences. This approach effectively captures distinctive linguistic patterns among malware and benign families, enabling finer-grained classification. We delve into n-gram size selection, feature representation, and classification algorithms. While evaluating our proposed method on real-world malware samples, we observe significantly improved accuracy compared to the traditional methods. By implementing our n-gram approach, we achieved an accuracy of 99.02% across various machine learning algorithms by using hybrid feature selection technique to address high dimensionality. Hybrid feature selection technique reduces the feature set to only 1.6% of the original features.

Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets -- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features ( $\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical foundation model developments.

Abstract: Random feature approximation is arguably one of the most widely used techniques for kernel methods in large-scale learning algorithms. In this work, we analyze the generalization properties of random feature methods, extending previous results for Tikhonov regularization to a broad class of spectral regularization techniques. This includes not only explicit methods but also implicit schemes such as gradient descent and accelerated algorithms like the Heavy-Ball and Nesterov method. Through this framework, we enable a theoretical analysis of neural networks and neural operators through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) approach trained via gradient descent. For our estimators we obtain optimal learning rates over regularity classes (even for classes that are not included in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space), which are defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves or completes previous results obtained in related settings for specific kernel algorithms.

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between the condition number of a neural network's weight tensor and the extent of information encoded by the associated processing unit, viewed through the lens of information theory. We argue that a high condition number, though not sufficient for effective knowledge encoding, may indicate that the unit has learned to selectively amplify and compress information. We formalize this intuition, particularly for linear units with Gaussian inputs, linking the condition number and the transformation's log-volume scaling factor to the characteristics of the output entropy and the geometric properties of the learned transformation. Our analysis demonstrates that for a fixed weight norm, a concentrated distribution of singular values (high condition number) corresponds to reduced overall information transfer, indicating a specialized and efficient encoding strategy. Furthermore, we present a practical case study where these principles are applied to guide selective fine-tuning of a multimodal Large Language Model, aiming to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during cross-modal adaptation. Unlike many existing catastrophic forgetting mitigation methods that rely on access to pre-training statistics, which are often unavailable, our selective fine-tuning approach offers a way to bypass this common requirement.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0% vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training, supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online, adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2 demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture recognition.

Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block sample size {and the level of heterogeneity is dense}. The second one is an extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.

<title>IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks</title>

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

<title>When Does Divide and Conquer Work for Long Context LLM? A Noise Decomposition Framework</title>

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in the real world must operate under dynamic and often unpredictable distribution shifts. This challenges the validity of statistical safety assurances on the system's risk established beforehand. Common risk control frameworks rely on fixed assumptions and lack mechanisms to continuously monitor deployment reliability. In this work, we propose a general framework for the real-time monitoring of risk violations in evolving data streams. Leveraging the 'testing by betting' paradigm, we propose a sequential hypothesis testing procedure to detect violations of bounded risks associated with the model's decision-making mechanism, while ensuring control on the false alarm rate. Our method operates under minimal assumptions on the nature of encountered shifts, rendering it broadly applicable. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by monitoring risks in outlier detection and set prediction under a variety of shifts.

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application, where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across 150 million users.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the amount of robot data. Our code, hardware, and data are open-sourced at: https://human2bots.github.io.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our method comprises three key components: influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the baseline.

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves. While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods, particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

Abstract: We present a method to improve the detection limit for radionuclides using spectroscopic radiation detectors and the arrival time of each detected radiation quantum. We enable this method using a neural network with an attention mechanism. We illustrate the method on the detection of Cesium release from a nuclear facility during an upset, and our method shows $2\times$ improvement over the traditional spectroscopic method. We hypothesize that our method achieves this performance increase by modulating its detection probability by the overall rate of probable detections, specifically by adapting detection thresholds based on temporal event distributions and local spectral features, and show evidence to this effect. We believe this method is applicable broadly and may be more successful for radionuclides with more complicated decay chains than Cesium; we also note that our method can generalize beyond the addition of arrival time and could integrate other data about each detection event, such as pulse quality, location in detector, or even combining the energy and time from detections in different detectors.

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs, but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety, efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation. The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's internal understanding of the world.

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However, their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER. This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development, enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared with deep learning model-based solutions.

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable, privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.

Abstract: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering. But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely adopted framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on online data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online phase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings, rich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to deploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained machine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and historical data into \emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this setting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true reward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML predictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose the Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which can be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data. When the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves the cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in cases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean rewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance matrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard UCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even when the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and true rewards are moderate.

Abstract: This paper systematizes research on auditing Differential Privacy (DP) techniques, aiming to identify key insights into the current state of the art and open challenges. First, we introduce a comprehensive framework for reviewing work in the field and establish three cross-contextual desiderata that DP audits should target--namely, efficiency, end-to-end-ness, and tightness. Then, we systematize the modes of operation of state-of-the-art DP auditing techniques, including threat models, attacks, and evaluation functions. This allows us to highlight key details overlooked by prior work, analyze the limiting factors to achieving the three desiderata, and identify open research problems. Overall, our work provides a reusable and systematic methodology geared to assess progress in the field and identify friction points and future directions for our community to focus on.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance. Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

<title>Incentivizing High-quality Participation From Federated Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning model (RCNet) for Delta-Sigma ($\Delta\Sigma$) ADCs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allow to describe both modulators and filters. This analogy is applied to Incremental ADCs (IADC). High-end optimizers combined with full-custom losses are used to define additional hardware design constraints: quantized weights, signal saturation, temporal noise injection, devices area. Focusing on DC conversion, our early results demonstrate that $SNR$ defined as an Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB) can be optimized under a certain hardware mapping complexity. The proposed RCNet succeeded to provide design tradeoffs in terms of $SNR$ ($>$13bit) versus area constraints ($<$14pF total capacitor) at a given $OSR$ (80 samples). Interestingly, it appears that the best RCNet architectures do not necessarily rely on high-order modulators, leveraging additional topology exploration degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$ approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles. The results for homogenized stresses ($<6\%$ error) show that the approach is computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models, potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity, suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education, yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By constraining all predictive information to pass through a short natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones, where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

State-of-the-art methods like Hybrid Monte Carlo often suffer from ergodicity issues near the time-continuum limit, leading to biased estimates. Leveraging symmetry-aware architectures as well as independent and identically distributed sampling, our approach resolves these issues and achieves significant speed-ups over traditional methods.

Abstract: Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is pivotal in Industry 4.0 and 5.0, proactively enhancing efficiency through accurate equipment Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, thus optimizing maintenance scheduling and reducing unexpected failures and premature interventions. This paper introduces a novel RUL estimation approach leveraging State Space Models (SSM) for efficient long-term sequence modeling. To handle model uncertainty, Simoultaneous Quantile Regression (SQR) is integrated into the SSM, enabling multiple quantile estimations. The proposed method is benchmarked against traditional sequence modelling techniques (LSTM, Transformer, Informer) using the C-MAPSS dataset. Results demonstrate superior accuracy and computational efficiency of SSM models, underscoring their potential for high-stakes industrial applications.

Abstract: Modern industrial systems are often subject to multiple failure modes, and their conditions are monitored by multiple sensors, generating multiple time-series signals. Additionally, time-to-failure data are commonly available. Accurately predicting a system's remaining useful life (RUL) requires effectively leveraging multi-sensor time-series data alongside multi-mode failure event data. In most existing models, failure modes and RUL prediction are performed independently, ignoring the inherent relationship between these two tasks. Some models integrate multiple failure modes and event prediction using black-box machine learning approaches, which lack statistical rigor and cannot characterize the inherent uncertainty in the model and data. This paper introduces a unified approach to jointly model the multi-sensor time-series data and failure time concerning multiple failure modes. This proposed model integrate a Cox proportional hazards model, a Convolved Multi-output Gaussian Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework with corresponding priors, enabling accurate prediction with robust uncertainty quantification. Posterior distributions are effectively obtained by Variational Bayes, and prediction is performed with Monte Carlo sampling. The advantages of the proposed model is validated through extensive numerical and case studies with jet-engine dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for future progress.

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity. Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications.

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles, while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency. However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and highlight several future research directions and open issues.

Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI) estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.

Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting, optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in the tree-based setting. In the specific case of Wasserstein barycentres, our approach can be viewed as extending fixed-point approaches for barycentre computation to the case of flow-based entropic OT solvers.

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods. In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints, including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

Abstract: The Tanimoto kernel (Jaccard index) is a well known tool to describe the similarity between sets of binary attributes. It has been extended to the case when the attributes are nonnegative real values. This paper introduces a more general Tanimoto kernel formulation which allows to measure the similarity of arbitrary real-valued functions. This extension is constructed by unifying the representation of the attributes via properly chosen sets. After deriving the general form of the kernel, explicit feature representation is extracted from the kernel function, and a simply way of including general kernels into the Tanimoto kernel is shown. Finally, the kernel is also expressed as a quotient of piecewise linear functions, and a smooth approximation is provided.

Abstract: First proposed by Seide (2014) as a heuristic, error feedback (EF) is a very popular mechanism for enforcing convergence of distributed gradient-based optimization methods enhanced with communication compression strategies based on the application of contractive compression operators. However, existing theory of EF relies on very strong assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients), and provides pessimistic convergence rates (e.g., while the best known rate for EF in the smooth nonconvex regime, and when full gradients are compressed, is $O(1/T^{2/3})$, the rate of gradient descent in the same regime is $O(1/T)$). Recently, Richt\'arik et al. (2021) proposed a new error feedback mechanism, EF21, based on the construction of a Markov compressor induced by a contractive compressor. EF21 removes the aforementioned theoretical deficiencies of EF and at the same time works better in practice. In this work we propose six practical extensions of EF21, all supported by strong convergence theory: partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal setting, momentum, and bidirectional compression. To the best of our knowledge, several of these techniques have not been previously analyzed in combination with EF, and in cases where prior analysis exists -- such as for bidirectional compression -- our theoretical convergence guarantees significantly improve upon existing results.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning that enabled the vast advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development over the past decades. However, this type of optimization requires differentiation, and with recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models w.r.t. efficiency, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors that utilizes methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP does not require gradient computation and generates sparse and thereby memory- and energy-efficient parameter updates and models. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. Via two applications - neural network pruning and the approximation-free training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) - we demonstrate that LFP combines increased efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. choice of model architecture and objective function. Our code is available at https://github.com/leanderweber/layerwise-feedback-propagation.

Abstract: Higher-order relations are widespread in nature, with numerous phenomena involving complex interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise connections. As a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth of various fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically represent these interactions using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation by introducing cellular sheaves for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction that adds extra structure to the conventional hypergraph while maintaining their local, higherorder connectivity. Drawing inspiration from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification.

Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). Those labelled training data provide crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.

Abstract: Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) is an emerging learning paradigm that tackles the task of training a machine learning (ML) model to predict missing parameters of an incomplete optimization problem, where the missing parameters are predicted. DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system, by integrating the prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the training and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the capacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications. However, very little is known about the performance of these models under adversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their performance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards the Predict-then-Optimize problem setting. Our study proposes the hypothesis that the robustness of a model is highly correlated with its ability to find predictions that lead to optimal decisions without deviating from the ground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the models that violate this condition and show how these models respond differently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training cycles.

Abstract: This study investigates the contextual best arm identification (BAI) problem, aiming to design an adaptive experiment to identify the best treatment arm conditioned on contextual information (covariates). We consider a decision-maker who assigns treatment arms to experimental units during an experiment and recommends the estimated best treatment arm based on the contexts at the end of the experiment. The decision-maker uses a policy for recommendations, which is a function that provides the estimated best treatment arm given the contexts. In our evaluation, we focus on the worst-case expected regret, a relative measure between the expected outcomes of an optimal policy and our proposed policy. We derive a lower bound for the expected simple regret and then propose a strategy called Adaptive Sampling-Policy Learning (PLAS). We prove that this strategy is minimax rate-optimal in the sense that its leading factor in the regret upper bound matches the lower bound as the number of experimental units increases.

Abstract: Web-scale training on paired text-image data is becoming increasingly central to multimodal learning, but is challenged by the highly noisy nature of datasets in the wild. Standard data filtering approaches succeed in removing mismatched text-image pairs, but permit semantically related but highly abstract or subjective text. These approaches lack the fine-grained ability to isolate the most concrete samples that provide the strongest signal for learning in a noisy dataset. In this work, we propose a new metric, image caption concreteness, that evaluates caption text without an image reference to measure its concreteness and relevancy for use in multimodal learning. Our approach leverages strong foundation models for measuring visual-semantic information loss in multimodal representations. We demonstrate that this strongly correlates with human evaluation of concreteness in both single-word and sentence-level texts. Moreover, we show that curation using ICC complements existing approaches: It succeeds in selecting the highest quality samples from multimodal web-scale datasets to allow for efficient training in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The increasing volume of electronic health records (EHRs) presents the opportunity to improve the accuracy and robustness of models in clinical prediction tasks. Unlike traditional centralized approaches, federated learning enables training on data from multiple institutions while preserving patient privacy and complying with regulatory constraints. In practice, healthcare institutions (i.e., hosts) often need to build predictive models tailored to their specific needs using federated learning. In this scenario, two key challenges arise: (1) ensuring compatibility across heterogeneous EHR systems, and (2) managing federated learning costs within budget constraints. To address these challenges, we propose EHRFL, a federated learning framework designed for building a cost-effective, host-specific predictive model using patient EHR data. EHRFL consists of two components: (1) text-based EHR modeling, which facilitates cross-institution compatibility without costly data standardization, and (2) a participant selection strategy based on averaged patient embedding similarity to reduce the number of participants without degrading performance. Experiments on multiple open-source EHR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both components. We believe our framework offers a practical solution for enabling healthcare institutions to build institution-specific predictive models under budgetary constraints.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) enables the automatic design of neural network models. However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead. Our method, dubbed nasgraph, remarkably reduces the computational costs by converting neural architectures to graphs and using the average degree, a graph measure, as the proxy in lieu of the evaluation metric. Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces. We also demonstrate that nasgraph generalizes to more challenging tasks on Micro TransNAS-Bench-101.

Abstract: Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent systems, enabling robust and data-efficient inductive generalization. Recent empirical evidence shows that many existing neural architectures, including Transformers, struggle with tasks requiring relational reasoning. In this work, we distinguish between two types of information: sensory information about the properties of individual objects, and relational information about the relationships between objects. While neural attention provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the flow of sensory information between objects, the Transformer lacks an explicit computational mechanism for routing and processing relational information. To address this limitation, we propose an architectural extension of the Transformer framework that we call the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), featuring two distinct attention mechanisms: sensory attention for directing the flow of sensory information, and a novel relational attention mechanism for directing the flow of relational information. We empirically evaluate DAT on a diverse set of tasks ranging from synthetic relational benchmarks to complex real-world tasks such as language modeling and visual processing. Our results demonstrate that integrating explicit relational computational mechanisms into the Transformer architecture leads to significant performance gains in terms of data efficiency and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: We initiate the study of a new notion of adversarial loss which we call distributional adversarial loss. In this notion, we assume for each original example, the allowed adversarial perturbation set is a family of distributions, and the adversarial loss over each example is the maximum loss over all the associated distributions. The goal is to minimize the overall adversarial loss. We show sample complexity bounds in the PAC-learning setting for our notion of adversarial loss. Our notion of adversarial loss contrasts the prior work on robust learning that considers a set of points, not distributions, as the perturbation set of each clean example. As an application of our approach, we show how to unify the two lines of work on randomized smoothing and robust learning in the PAC-learning setting and derive sample complexity bounds for randomized smoothing methods.
  Furthermore, we investigate the role of randomness in achieving robustness against adversarial attacks. We show a general derandomization technique that preserves the extent of a randomized classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks and show its effectiveness empirically.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate semantic communication in high-speed mobile Internet of vehicles (IoV) environments, with a focus on the spectrum sharing between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. We specifically address spectrum scarcity and network traffic and then propose a semantic-aware spectrum sharing algorithm (SSS) based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) soft actor-critic (SAC) approach. Firstly, we delve into the extraction of semantic information. Secondly, we redefine metrics for semantic information in V2V and V2I spectrum sharing in IoV environments, introducing high-speed semantic spectrum efficiency (HSSE) and semantic transmission rate (HSR). Finally, we employ the SAC algorithm for decision optimization in V2V and V2I spectrum sharing based on semantic information. This optimization encompasses the optimal link of V2V and V2I sharing strategies, the transmission power for vehicles sending semantic information and the length of transmitted semantic symbols, aiming at maximizing HSSE of V2I and enhancing success rate of effective semantic information transmission (SRS) of V2V. Experimental results demonstrate that the SSS algorithm outperforms other baseline algorithms, including other traditional-communication-based spectrum sharing algorithms and spectrum sharing algorithm using other reinforcement learning approaches. The SSS algorithm exhibits a 15% increase in HSSE and approximately a 7% increase in SRS.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model. Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: As a promising technology, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can provide computing and caching services by deploying VEC servers near vehicles. However, VEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin (DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time states by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT with VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the real-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT model requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer computing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and scheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general VEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two types of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within the network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we propose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource utility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the non-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes to reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and computing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC) algorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our proposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.

<title>Joint Optimization of Age of Information and Energy Consumption in NR-V2X System based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio (NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X (C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2, resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI). Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI. Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract: The United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Premarket Notification 510(k) pathway allows manufacturers to gain approval for a medical device by demonstrating its substantial equivalence to another legally marketed device. However, the inherent ambiguity of this regulatory procedure has led to high recall rates for many devices cleared through this pathway. This trend has raised significant concerns regarding the efficacy of the FDA's current approach, prompting a reassessment of the 510(k) regulatory framework. In this paper, we develop a combined human-algorithm approach to assist the FDA in improving its 510(k) medical device clearance process by reducing the risk of recalls and the workload imposed on the FDA. We first develop machine learning methods to estimate the risk of recall of 510(k) medical devices based on the information available at submission time. We then propose a data-driven clearance policy that recommends acceptance, rejection, or deferral to FDA's committees for in-depth evaluation. We conduct an empirical study using a unique large-scale dataset of over 31,000 medical devices that we assembled based on data sources from the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS). A conservative evaluation of our proposed policy based on this data shows a 32.9% improvement in the recall rate and a 40.5% reduction in the FDA's workload. Our analyses also indicate that implementing our policy could result in significant annual cost savings of $1.7 billion, which highlights the value of using a holistic and data-driven approach to improve the FDA's current 510(k) medical device evaluation pathway.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning approach, that protects the privacy of each vehicle by allowing the model to be trained on multiple devices simultaneously without the need to upload all data to a road side unit (RSU). This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or widely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the labeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are not suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular networks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges constantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way for training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity, owing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of the aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper proposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called FLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for self-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) leverage Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) to enhance data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This integration inevitably increases computing demands, risking real-time system stability. Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) addresses this by offloading tasks to Road Side Unit (RSU), ensuring timely services. Our previous work FLSimCo algorithm, which uses local resources for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), though vehicles often can't complete all iterations task. Our improved algorithm offloads partial task to RSU and optimizes energy consumption by adjusting transmission power, CPU frequency, and task assignment ratios, balancing local and RSU-based training. Meanwhile, setting an offloading threshold further prevents inefficiencies. Simulation results show that the enhanced algorithm reduces energy consumption, improves offloading efficiency and the accuracy of Federated SSL.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples outside the training category space, which is an essential component in building reliable machine learning systems. Existing reviews on OOD detection primarily focus on method taxonomy, surveying the field by categorizing various approaches. However, many recent works concentrate on non-traditional OOD detection scenarios, such as test-time adaptation, multi-modal data sources and other novel contexts. In this survey, we uniquely review recent advances in OOD detection from the task-oriented perspective for the first time. According to the user's access to the model, that is, whether the OOD detection method is allowed to modify or retrain the model, we classify the methods as training-driven or training-agnostic. Besides, considering the rapid development of pre-trained models, large pre-trained model-based OOD detection is also regarded as an important category and discussed separately. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of the evaluation scenarios, a variety of applications, and several future research directions. We believe this survey with new taxonomy will benefit the proposal of new methods and the expansion of more practical scenarios. A curated list of related papers is provided in the Github repository: https://github.com/shuolucs/Awesome-Out-Of-Distribution-Detection.

<title>Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference Requests Without Approximations</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.
  We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
  Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

Abstract: The Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which iteratively projects onto the space of Markov processes and the reciprocal class, successfully solves the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem. However, an efficient practical implementation requires a heuristic modification - alternating between fitting forward and backward time diffusion at each iteration. This modification is crucial for stabilizing training and achieving reliable results in applications such as unpaired domain translation. Our work reveals a close connection between the modified version of IMF and the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure - a foundational method for the SB problem, also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm. Specifically, we demonstrate that the heuristic modification of the IMF effectively integrates both IMF and IPF procedures. We refer to this combined approach as the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting (IPMF) procedure. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we establish the convergence of IPMF procedure under various settings, contributing to developing a unified framework for solving SB problems. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, the IPMF procedure enables a flexible trade-off between image similarity and generation quality, offering a new mechanism for tailoring models to specific tasks.

Abstract: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e., fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.

Abstract: We propose a new programming language called ALTA and a compiler that can map ALTA programs to Transformer weights. ALTA is inspired by RASP, a language proposed by Weiss et al. (2021), and Tracr (Lindner et al., 2023), a compiler from RASP programs to Transformer weights. ALTA complements and extends this prior work, offering the ability to express loops and to compile programs to Universal Transformers, among other advantages. ALTA allows us to constructively show how Transformers can represent length-invariant algorithms for computing parity and addition, as well as a solution to the SCAN benchmark of compositional generalization tasks, without requiring intermediate scratchpad decoding steps. We also propose tools to analyze cases where the expressibility of an algorithm is established, but end-to-end training on a given training set fails to induce behavior consistent with the desired algorithm. To this end, we explore training from ALTA execution traces as a more fine-grained supervision signal. This enables additional experiments and theoretical analyses relating the learnability of various algorithms to data availability and modeling decisions, such as positional encodings. We make the ALTA framework -- language specification, symbolic interpreter, and weight compiler -- available to the community to enable further applications and insights.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.

Abstract: In the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, privacy protection has become crucial, giving rise to machine unlearning. Machine unlearning is a technique that removes specific data influences from trained models without the need for extensive retraining. However, it faces several key challenges, including accurately implementing unlearning, ensuring privacy protection during the unlearning process, and achieving effective unlearning without significantly compromising model performance. This paper presents a novel approach to machine unlearning by employing Layer-wise Relevance Analysis and Neuronal Path Perturbation. We address three primary challenges: the lack of detailed unlearning principles, privacy guarantees in zero-shot unlearning scenario, and the balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Our method balances machine unlearning performance and model utility by identifying and perturbing highly relevant neurons, thereby achieving effective unlearning. By using data not present in the original training set during the unlearning process, we satisfy the zero-shot unlearning scenario and ensure robust privacy protection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes targeted data from the target unlearning model while maintaining the model's utility, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Adapting-While-Learning.

Abstract: Due to the size and complexity of modern large language models (LLMs), it has proven challenging to uncover the underlying mechanisms that models use to solve reasoning problems. For instance, is their reasoning for a specific problem localized to certain parts of the network? Do they break down the reasoning problem into modular components that are then executed as sequential steps as we go deeper in the model? To better understand the reasoning capability of LLMs, we study a minimal propositional logic problem that requires combining multiple facts to arrive at a solution. By studying this problem on Mistral and Gemma models, up to 27B parameters, we illuminate the core components the models use to solve such logic problems. From a mechanistic interpretability point of view, we use causal mediation analysis to uncover the pathways and components of the LLMs' reasoning processes. Then, we offer fine-grained insights into the functions of attention heads in different layers. We not only find a sparse circuit that computes the answer, but we decompose it into sub-circuits that have four distinct and modular uses. Finally, we reveal that three distinct models -- Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B and Gemma-2-27B -- contain analogous but not identical mechanisms.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of large language models (LLMs) is critical for provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability. Existing approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Associative memory models, such as Hopfield networks and their modern variants, have garnered renewed interest due to advancements in memory capacity and connections with self-attention in transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>On the Limits of Language Generation: Trade-Offs Between Hallucination and Mode Collapse</title>

Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.

Abstract: Sequential learning in a multi-agent resource constrained matching market has received significant interest in the past few years. We study decentralized learning in two-sided matching markets where the demand side (aka players or agents) competes for the supply side (aka arms) with potentially time-varying preferences to obtain a stable match. Motivated by the linear contextual bandit framework, we assume that for each agent, an arm-mean may be represented by a linear function of a known feature vector and an unknown (agent-specific) parameter. Moreover, the preferences over arms depend on a latent environment in each round, where the latent environment varies across rounds in a non-stationary manner. We propose learning algorithms to identify the latent environment and obtain stable matchings simultaneously. Our proposed algorithms achieve instance-dependent logarithmic regret, scaling independently of the number of arms, and hence applicable for a large market.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular approach for aligning language models using pairwise preferences. However, in practical post-training pipelines, on-policy generation typically yields multiple candidate responses per prompt, which are scored by a reward model to guide learning. In this setting, we propose $\textbf{Multi-Preference Optimization (MPO)}$, a generalization of DPO that optimizes over entire sets of responses by extending the Bradley-Terry model to groupwise comparisons between chosen and rejected sets. To further enhance learning, MPO employs deviation-based weighting, which emphasizes outlier responses that deviate most from the mean reward, effectively inducing a self-paced curriculum. We theoretically prove that MPO reduces alignment bias at a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ with respect to the number of responses per query. Empirically, MPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UltraFeedback benchmark and yields up to $\sim 17.5\%$ improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2, establishing a new baseline for preference-based alignment

<title>Ladder-residual: parallelism-aware architecture for accelerating large model inference with communication overlapping</title>

Abstract: Large language model inference is both memory-intensive and time-consuming, often requiring distributed algorithms to efficiently scale. Various model parallelism strategies are used in multi-gpu training and inference to partition computation across multiple devices, reducing memory load and computation time. However, using model parallelism necessitates communication of information between GPUs, which has been a major bottleneck and limits the gains obtained by scaling up the number of devices. We introduce Ladder Residual, a simple architectural modification applicable to all residual-based models that enables straightforward overlapping that effectively hides the latency of communication. Our insight is that in addition to systems optimization, one can also redesign the model architecture to decouple communication from computation. While Ladder Residual can allow communication-computation decoupling in conventional parallelism patterns, we focus on Tensor Parallelism in this paper, which is particularly bottlenecked by its heavy communication. For a Transformer model with 70B parameters, applying Ladder Residual to all its layers can achieve 29% end-to-end wall clock speed up at inference time with TP sharding over 8 devices. We refer the resulting Transformer model as the Ladder Transformer. We train a 1B and 3B Ladder Transformer from scratch and observe comparable performance to a standard dense transformer baseline. We also show that it is possible to convert parts of the Llama-3.1 8B model to our Ladder Residual architecture with minimal accuracy degradation by only retraining for 3B tokens. We release our code for training and inference for easier replication of experiments.

Abstract: Learned optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to hand-crafted optimizers, with the potential to discover stronger learned update rules that enable faster, hyperparameter-free training of neural networks. A critical element for practically useful learned optimizers, that can be used off-the-shelf after meta-training, is strong meta-generalization: the ability to apply the optimizers to new tasks. Recent state-of-the-art work in learned optimizers, VeLO (Metz et al., 2022), requires a large number of highly diverse meta-training tasks along with massive computational resources, 4000 TPU months, to achieve meta-generalization. This makes further improvements to such learned optimizers impractical. In this work, we identify several key elements in learned optimizer architectures and meta-training procedures that can lead to strong meta-generalization. We also propose evaluation metrics to reliably assess quantitative performance of an optimizer at scale on a set of evaluation tasks. Our proposed approach, Celo, makes a significant leap in improving the meta-generalization performance of learned optimizers and also outperforms tuned state-of-the-art optimizers on a diverse set of out-of-distribution tasks, despite being meta-trained for just 24 GPU hours.

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains due to its efficiency and modularity. Meanwhile, vanilla LoRA struggles with task conflicts in multi-task scenarios. Recent works adopt Mixture of Experts (MoE) by treating each LoRA module as an expert, thereby mitigating task interference through multiple specialized LoRA modules. While effective, these methods often isolate knowledge within individual tasks, failing to fully exploit the shared knowledge across related tasks. In this paper, we establish a connection between single LoRA and multi-LoRA MoE, integrating them into a unified framework. We demonstrate that the dynamic routing of multiple LoRAs is functionally equivalent to rank partitioning and block-level activation within a single LoRA. We further empirically demonstrate that finer-grained LoRA partitioning, within the same total and activated parameter constraints, leads to better performance gains across heterogeneous tasks. Building on these findings, we propose Single-ranked Mixture of Experts LoRA (\textbf{SMoRA}), which embeds MoE into LoRA by \textit{treating each rank as an independent expert}. With a \textit{dynamic rank-wise activation} mechanism, SMoRA promotes finer-grained knowledge sharing while mitigating task conflicts. Experiments demonstrate that SMoRA activates fewer parameters yet achieves better performance in multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that label noise can lead to poor generalization performance, negatively affecting classification accuracy. Therefore, understanding the effectiveness of classifiers trained using deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels is of considerable practical significance. In this paper, we focus on the error bounds of excess risks for classification problems with noisy labels within deep learning frameworks. We derive error bounds for the excess risk, decomposing it into statistical error and approximation error. To handle statistical dependencies (e.g., mixing sequences), we employ an independent block construction to bound the error, leveraging techniques for dependent processes. For the approximation error, we establish these theoretical results to the vector-valued setting, where the output space consists of $K$-dimensional unit vectors. Finally, under the low-dimensional manifold hypothesis, we further refine the approximation error to mitigate the impact of high-dimensional input spaces.

Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.

Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining statistically guaranteed prediction sets for functional machine learning methods: surrogate models which map between function spaces, motivated by the need to build reliable PDE emulators. The method constructs nested prediction sets on a low-dimensional representation (an SVD) of the surrogate model's error, and then maps these sets to the prediction space using set-propagation techniques. This results in prediction sets for functional surrogate models with conformal prediction coverage guarantees. We use zonotopes as basis of the set construction, which allow an exact linear propagation and are closed under Cartesian products, making them well-suited to this high-dimensional problem. The method is model agnostic and can thus be applied to complex Sci-ML models, including Neural Operators, but also in simpler settings. We also introduce a technique to capture the truncation error of the SVD, preserving the guarantees of the method.

Abstract: We introduce a practical, black-box framework termed Detection Augmenting Learning (DAL) for the problem of non-stationary bandits without prior knowledge of the underlying non-stationarity. DAL is modular, accepting any stationary bandit algorithm as input and augmenting it with a change detector. Our approach is applicable to all common parametric and non-parametric bandit variants. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that DAL consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across diverse non-stationary scenarios, including synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, underscoring its versatility and scalability. We provide theoretical insights into DAL's strong empirical performance on piecewise stationary and drift settings, complemented by thorough experimental validation.

Abstract: The notion of generalization has moved away from the classical one defined in statistical learning theory towards an emphasis on out-of-domain generalization (OODG). There has been a growing focus on generalization from easy to hard, where a progression of difficulty implicitly governs the direction of domain shifts. This emerging regime has appeared in the literature under different names, such as length/logical/algorithmic extrapolation, but a formal definition is lacking. We argue that the unifying theme is induction -- based on finite samples observed in training, a learner should infer an inductive principle that applies in an unbounded manner. This work formalizes the notion of inductive generalization along a difficulty progression and argues that our path ahead lies in transforming the learning paradigm. We attempt to make inroads by proposing a novel learning paradigm, Inductive Learning, which involves a central concept called model successors. We outline practical steps to adapt well-established techniques towards learning model successors. This work calls for restructuring of the research discussion around induction and generalization from fragmented task-centric communities to a more unified effort, focused on universal properties of learning and computation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel inference-time alignment approach for LLMs that aims to generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. Our approach models the generation of safe responses as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the LLM's latent space. We augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and dynamically penalize unsafe generations to ensure the generation of safe responses. Consequently, we demonstrate formal safety guarantees w.r.t. the given cost model upon solving the MDP in the latent space with sufficiently large penalties. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate that InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses. Our findings contribute to the advancement of safer LLM deployment through alignment at inference-time, thus presenting a promising alternative to resource-intensive, overfitting-prone alignment techniques like RLHF.

Abstract: Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.

Abstract: To detect unauthorized data usage in training large-scale generative models (e.g., ChatGPT or Midjourney), membership inference attacks (MIA) have proven effective in distinguishing a single training instance (a member) from a single non-training instance (a non-member). This success is mainly credited to a memorization effect: models tend to perform better on a member than a non-member. However, we find that standard MIAs fail against distilled generative models (i.e., student models) that are increasingly deployed in practice for efficiency (e.g., ChatGPT 4o-mini). Trained exclusively on data generated from a large-scale model (a teacher model), the student model lacks direct exposure to any members (teacher's training data), nullifying the memorization effect that standard MIAs rely on. This finding reveals a serious privacy loophole, where generation-service providers could deploy a student model whose teacher was potentially trained on unauthorized data, yet claim the deployed model is clean because it was not directly trained on such data. Hence, are distilled models inherently unauditable for upstream privacy violations, and should we discard them when we care about privacy? We contend no, as we uncover a memory chain connecting the student and teacher's member data: the distribution of student-generated data aligns more closely with the distribution of the teacher's members than with non-members, thus we can detect unauthorized data usage even when direct instance-level memorization is absent. This leads us to posit that MIAs on distilled generative models should shift from instance-level scores to distribution-level statistics. We further propose three principles of distribution-based MIAs for detecting unauthorized training data through distilled generative models, and validate our position through an exemplar framework. We lastly discuss the implications of our position.

Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory dynamics. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network, which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student-weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Our analysis further casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported by experiments on synthetic regression problems, as well as real vision and NLP tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep neural networks (DNNs) is inherently accompanied by the problem of high computational costs. To tackle this challenge, dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) is emerging as a promising technology for balancing the latency and energy consumption of DNN inference by adjusting the computing frequency of processors. However, most existing models of DNN inference time are based on the CPU-DVFS technique, and directly applying the CPU-DVFS model to DNN inference on GPUs will lead to significant errors in optimizing latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a DVFS-aware latency model to precisely characterize DNN inference time on GPUs. We first formulate the DNN inference time based on extensive experiment results for different devices and analyze the impact of fitting parameters. Then by dividing DNNs into multiple blocks and obtaining the actual inference time, the proposed model is further verified. Finally, we compare our proposed model with the CPU-DVFS model in two specific cases. Evaluation results demonstrate that local inference optimization with our proposed model achieves a reduction of no less than 66% and 69% in inference time and energy consumption respectively. In addition, cooperative inference with our proposed model can improve the partition policy and reduce the energy consumption compared to the CPU-DVFS model.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the power of scaling test-time compute to achieve strong performance on complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and test-time search and reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown remarkable success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Traditional RLHF approaches rely on a fixed dataset, which often suffers from limited coverage. To this end, online RLHF has emerged as a promising direction, enabling iterative data collection and model improvement. Despite its potential, this paradigm faces a key bottleneck: the requirement to continuously integrate new data into the historical dataset and re-optimize the model from scratch at each iteration, resulting in computational and storage costs that grow linearly with the number of iterations. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a one-pass reward modeling method that does not require storing the historical data and can be computed in constant time. Specifically, we first formalize RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem and design an online mirror descent algorithm with a tailored local norm to replace the standard maximum likelihood estimation for reward modeling. We then apply our method to various online RLHF settings, including passive data collection, active data collection, and deployment-time adaptation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that our method improves both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we provide practical algorithms and conduct experiments using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models on the Ultrafeedback-binarized and Mixture2 datasets, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.

Abstract: We study the problem of reinforcement learning in infinite-horizon discounted linear Markov decision processes (MDPs), and propose the first computationally efficient algorithm achieving rate-optimal regret guarantees in this setting. Our main idea is to combine two classic techniques for optimistic exploration: additive exploration bonuses applied to the reward function, and artificial transitions made to an absorbing state with maximal return. We show that, combined with a regularized approximate dynamic-programming scheme, the resulting algorithm achieves a regret of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{d^3 (1 - \gamma)^{- 7 / 2} T})$, where $T$ is the total number of sample transitions, $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor, and $d$ is the feature dimensionality. The results continue to hold against adversarial reward sequences, enabling application of our method to the problem of imitation learning in linear MDPs, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.

Abstract: Decision tree optimization is fundamental to interpretable machine learning. The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).

Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both environmental dependencies and their directionality. We benchmark RNNs against directed STGNNs on two 15-min-resolution datasets from Volos (Greece): a six-variable 2020 installation and a more complex eight-variable greenhouse monitored in autumn 2024. In the simpler 2020 case the RNN attains near-perfect accuracy, outperforming the STGNN. When additional drivers are available in 2024, the STGNN overtakes the RNN ($R^{2}=0.905$ vs $0.740$), demonstrating that explicitly modelling directional dependencies becomes critical as interaction complexity grows. These findings indicate when graph-based models are warranted and provide a stepping-stone toward digital twins that jointly optimise crop yield and PV power in agrivoltaic greenhouses.

Abstract: Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.

Abstract: The rising proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix introduces significant operational challenges for power grid operators. Effective power grid management demands adaptive decision-making strategies capable of handling dynamic conditions. With the increase in complexity, more and more Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to find suitable grid topologies for congestion management. In this work, we contribute to this research by introducing a novel Imitation Learning (IL) approach that leverages soft labels derived from simulated topological action outcomes, thereby capturing multiple viable actions per state. Unlike traditional IL methods that rely on hard labels to enforce a single optimal action, our method constructs soft labels that capture the effectiveness of actions that prove suitable in resolving grid congestion. To further enhance decision-making, we integrate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the structural properties of power grids, ensuring that the topology-aware representations contribute to better agent performance. Our approach significantly outperforms its hard-label counterparts as well as state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baseline agents. Most notably, it achieves a 17% better performance compared to the greedy expert agent from which the imitation targets were derived.

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications demand the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving model training across distributed devices. Over-The-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) exploits the superposition property of multiple access channels, allowing edge users in 6G networks to efficiently share spectral resources and perform low-latency global model aggregation. However, these advantages come with challenges, as traditional OTA-FL techniques suffer due to the joint effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the server, fading, and both data and system heterogeneity at the participating edge devices. In this work, we propose the novel Noise Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework to jointly tackle these challenges in federated wireless networks. In NoROTA-FL, the local optimization problems find controlled inexact solutions, which manifests as an additional proximal constraint at the clients. This approach provides robustness against straggler-induced partial work, heterogeneity, noise, and fading. From a theoretical perspective, we leverage the zeroth- and first-order inexactness and establish convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in the presence of heterogeneous data and varying system capabilities. Experimentally, we validate NoROTA-FL on real-world datasets, including FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and heterogeneous environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as COTAF and FedProx, NoROTA-FL achieves significantly more stable convergence and higher accuracy, particularly in the presence of stragglers.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can provide adaptive and scalable controllers essential for power grid decarbonization. However, RL methods struggle with power grids' complex dynamics, long-horizon goals, and hard physical constraints. For these reasons, we present RL2Grid, a benchmark designed in collaboration with power system operators to accelerate progress in grid control and foster RL maturity. Built on RTE France's power simulation framework, RL2Grid standardizes tasks, state and action spaces, and reward structures for a systematic evaluation and comparison of RL algorithms. Moreover, we integrate operational heuristics and design safety constraints based on human expertise to ensure alignment with physical requirements. By establishing reference performance metrics for classic RL baselines on RL2Grid's tasks, we highlight the need for novel methods capable of handling real systems and discuss future directions for RL-based grid control.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The rapid accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has transformed healthcare by providing valuable data that enhance clinical predictions and diagnoses. While conventional machine learning models have proven effective, they often lack robust representation learning and depend heavily on expert-crafted features. Although deep learning offers powerful solutions, it is often criticized for its lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose DeepSelective, a novel end to end deep learning framework for predicting patient prognosis using EHR data, with a strong emphasis on enhancing model interpretability. DeepSelective combines data compression techniques with an innovative feature selection approach, integrating custom-designed modules that work together to improve both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSelective not only enhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves interpretability, making it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across diverse graph-based tasks by leveraging message passing to capture complex node relationships. However, when applied to large-scale real-world graphs, GNNs face two major challenges: First, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure both scalability and efficiency, as the repeated aggregation of large neighborhoods leads to significant computational overhead; Second, the over-smoothing problem arises, where excessive or deep propagation makes node representations indistinguishable, severely hindering model expressiveness. To tackle these issues, we propose ScaleGNN, a novel framework that adaptively fuses multi-level graph features for both scalable and effective graph learning. ScaleGNN first constructs per-order neighbor matrices that capture only the exclusive structural information at each hop, avoiding the redundancy of conventional aggregation. A learnable fusion module then selectively integrates these features, emphasizing the most informative high-order neighbors. To further reduce redundancy and over-smoothing, we introduce a Local Contribution Score (LCS)-based masking mechanism to filter out less relevant high-order neighbors, ensuring that only the most meaningful information is aggregated. In addition, a task-aware feature fusion strategy dynamically balances low- and high-order information, preserving both local detail and global context without incurring excessive complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ScaleGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting its practical value for large-scale graph learning.

Abstract: Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate coefficient estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the loss function. However, effective training of PINNs remains challenging due to internal covariate shift, which destabilizes feature distributions and impairs model expressiveness. While normalization techniques like Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are standard remedies in deep learning, they disrupt the pointwise input-output mappings critical to preserving the physical consistency in PINNs. In this work, we introduce Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that regulates internal feature distributions through a smooth, learnable mask function applied pointwise across hidden layers. Unlike conventional normalization methods, the proposed mask function preserves the deterministic nature of input-output relationships while suppressing activation drift and saturation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs control feature spread near initialization by attenuating gradient variance growth through a tailored modulation mechanism. Empirically, we validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks across diverse activation functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness, with relative L2 errors reduced by up to two orders of magnitude over baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs enable the effective use of wider networks, overcoming a key limitation in existing PINN frameworks.

Abstract: We present the Boltzmann classifier, a novel distance based probabilistic classification algorithm inspired by the Boltzmann distribution. Unlike traditional classifiers that produce hard decisions or uncalibrated probabilities, the Boltzmann classifier assigns class probabilities based on the average distance to the nearest neighbors within each class, providing interpretable, physically meaningful outputs. We evaluate the performance of the method across three application domains: molecular activity prediction, oxidation state classification of transition metal complexes, and breast cancer diagnosis. In the molecular activity task, the classifier achieved the highest accuracy in predicting active compounds against two protein targets, with strong correlations observed between the predicted probabilities and experimental pIC50 values. For metal complexes, the classifier accurately distinguished between oxidation states II and III for Fe, Mn, and Co, using only metal-ligand bond lengths extracted from crystallographic data, and demonstrated high consistency with known chemical trends. In the breast cancer dataset, the classifier achieved 97% accuracy, with low confidence predictions concentrated in inherently ambiguous cases. Across all tasks, the Boltzmann classifier performed competitively or better than standard models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. Its probabilistic outputs were found to correlate with continuous physical or biological properties, highlighting its potential utility in both classification and regression contexts. The results suggest that the Boltzmann classifier is a robust and interpretable alternative to conventional machine learning approaches, particularly in scientific domains where underlying structure property relationships are important.

<title>Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and prolonged training durations. To address this challenge, we build upon prior work that introduced a neural architecture with permutation-invariant sensory processing. We propose a modified attention mechanism that applies a non-linear transformation to the key vectors (K), producing enriched representations (K') through a custom mapping function. This Nonlinear Attention (NLA) mechanism enhances the representational capacity of the attention layer, enabling the agent to learn more expressive feature interactions. As a result, our model achieves significantly faster convergence and improved training efficiency, while maintaining performance on par with the baseline. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear attention mechanisms to accelerate reinforcement learning without sacrificing effectiveness.

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset, detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is emerging as a primary driver for improving language model reasoning capabilities. A fundamental question is whether current reinforcement learning algorithms -- such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the de facto standard algorithm used to improve language model reasoning -- merely sharpen the base model's distribution around problems it can already solve. We investigate this question in the context of formal theorem proving, which has access to a perfect verifier. We identify a degenerate rank bias in GRPO in which highly probable trajectories are reinforced and rare ones are neglected. This results in distribution sharpening: the model can solve some problems with fewer samples, but underperforms simply sampling more solutions from the original model. To overcome GRPO's rank bias we introduce unlikeliness reward, a simple method for explicitly up-weighting rare but correct solutions. We show that unlikeliness reward mitigates rank bias and improves pass@$N$ across a large range of $N$ in both synthetic and real theorem proving settings. We also uncover an unexpected link between rank bias and a seemingly mundane hyperparameter -- the number of updates per batch -- that leads to a second, complementary mitigation. We combine our insights into a revised GRPO training recipe for formal theorem proving, yielding an open pipeline that achieves competitive performance to DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We release our implementation at https://github.com/AndreHe02/rewarding-unlikely-release

Abstract: When training autoregressive models to forecast dynamical systems, a critical question arises: how far into the future should the model be trained to predict? Too short a horizon may miss long-term trends, while too long a horizon can impede convergence due to accumulating prediction errors. In this work, we formalize this trade-off by analyzing how the geometry of the loss landscape depends on the training horizon. We prove that for chaotic systems, the loss landscape's roughness grows exponentially with the training horizon, while for limit cycles, it grows linearly, making long-horizon training inherently challenging. However, we also show that models trained on long horizons generalize well to short-term forecasts, whereas those trained on short horizons suffer exponentially (resp. linearly) worse long-term predictions in chaotic (resp. periodic) systems. We validate our theory through numerical experiments and discuss practical implications for selecting training horizons. Our results provide a principled foundation for hyperparameter optimization in autoregressive forecasting models.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective, revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g., Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS, attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor. Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential and increasingly important with more computing invested, for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling where, unlike training, accuracy has yet to saturate as a function of computation, and continues to improve through increased generation. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/Kinetics.

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K, Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/Info-Coevolution/.

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2 state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small, imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework. KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally.

Abstract: While several previous studies have analyzed gender bias in research, we are still missing a comprehensive analysis of gender differences in the AI community, covering diverse topics and different development trends. Using the AI Scholar dataset of 78K researchers in the field of AI, we identify several gender differences: (1) Although female researchers tend to have fewer overall citations than males, this citation difference does not hold for all academic-age groups; (2) There exist large gender homophily in co-authorship on AI papers; (3) Female first-authored papers show distinct linguistic styles, such as longer text, more positive emotion words, and more catchy titles than male first-authored papers. Our analysis provides a window into the current demographic trends in our AI community, and encourages more gender equality and diversity in the future. Our code and data are at https://github.com/causalNLP/ai-scholar-gender.

Abstract: We present a model-agnostic framework for the construction of prediction intervals of insurance claims, with finite sample statistical guarantees, extending the technique of split conformal prediction to the domain of two-stage frequency-severity modeling. The framework effectiveness is showcased with simulated and real datasets using classical parametric models and contemporary machine learning methods. When the underlying severity model is a random forest, we extend the two-stage split conformal prediction algorithm, showing how the out-of-bag mechanism can be leveraged to eliminate the need for a calibration set in the conformal procedure.

Abstract: I study statistical discrimination driven by verifiable beliefs, such as those generated by machine learning, rather than by humans. When beliefs are verifiable, interventions against statistical discrimination can move beyond simple, belief-free designs like affirmative action, to more sophisticated ones, that constrain decision makers based on what they are thinking. I design a belief-contingent intervention I call common identity. I show that it is effective at eliminating equilibrium statistical discrimination, even when training data exhibit the various statistical biases that often plague algorithmic decision problems.

<title>Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Segmentation via Conservative Propagation of Scene-level Labels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06799</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2312.06799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation method for point clouds that predicts "per-point" labels from just "whole-scene" annotations. The key challenge here is the discrepancy between the target of dense per-point semantic prediction and training losses derived from only scene-level labels. To address this, in addition to the typical weakly-supervised setup that supervises all points with the scene label, we propose to conservatively propagate the scene-level labels to points selectively. Specifically, we over-segment point cloud features via unsupervised clustering in the entire dataset and form primitives. We then associate scene-level labels with primitives through bipartite matching. Then, we allow labels to pass through this primitive-label relationship, while further encouraging features to form narrow clusters around the primitives. Importantly, through bipartite matching, this additional pathway through which labels flow, only propagates scene labels to the most relevant points, reducing the potential negative impact caused by the global approach that existing methods take. We evaluate our method on ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, outperforming the state of the art by a large margin.

Abstract: Safely exploring environments with a-priori unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge that restricts the autonomy of robots. While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for non-linear systems with finite time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex non-linear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SageMPC, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control. SageMPC leverages three key techniques: i) exploiting a Lipschitz bound, ii) goal-directed exploration, and iii) receding horizon style re-planning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.

<title>AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential Reasoning Ability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09404</link>

arXiv:2402.09404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning method for solving high-dimensional stochastic control problems based on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation and physics-informed learning. Our approach is to parameterize the feedback control and the value function using a decoupled neural network with multiple outputs. We train this network by using a loss function with penalty terms that enforce the HJB equation along the sampled trajectories generated by the controlled system. More significantly, numerical results on various applications are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and applicable.

Abstract: Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.

Abstract: A/B testing has become the gold standard for policy evaluation in modern technological industries. Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.

Abstract: We study the learning problem associated with spiking neural networks. Specifically, we focus on spiking neural networks composed of simple spiking neurons having only positive synaptic weights, equipped with an affine encoder and decoder; we refer to these as affine spiking neural networks. These neural networks are shown to depend continuously on their parameters, which facilitates classical covering number-based generalization statements and supports stable gradient-based training. We demonstrate that the positivity of the weights enables a wide range of expressivity results, including rate-optimal approximation of smooth functions and dimension-independent approximation of Barron regular functions. In particular, we show in theory and simulations that affine spiking neural networks are capable of approximating shallow ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we apply these affine spiking neural networks to standard machine learning benchmarks and reach competitive results. Finally, we observe that from a generalization perspective, contrary to feedforward neural networks or previous results for general spiking neural networks, the depth has little to no adverse effect on the generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new gradient-based XAI method called Guided AbsoluteGrad for saliency map explanations. We utilize both positive and negative gradient magnitudes and employ gradient variance to distinguish the important areas for noise deduction. We also introduce a novel evaluation metric named ReCover And Predict (RCAP), which considers the Localization and Visual Noise Level objectives of the explanations. We propose two propositions for these two objectives and prove the necessity of evaluating them. We evaluate Guided AbsoluteGrad with seven gradient-based XAI methods using the RCAP metric and other SOTA metrics in three case studies: (1) ImageNet dataset with ResNet50 model; (2) International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset with EfficientNet model; (3) the Places365 dataset with DenseNet161 model. Our method surpasses other gradient-based approaches, showcasing the quality of enhanced saliency map explanations through gradient magnitude.

Abstract: Sparse tensor operations are increasingly important in diverse applications such as social networks, deep learning, diagnosis, crime, and review analysis. However, a major obstacle in sparse tensor research is the lack of large-scale sparse tensor datasets. Another challenge lies in analyzing sparse tensor features, which are essential not only for understanding the nonzero pattern but also for selecting the most suitable storage format, decomposition algorithm, and reordering methods. However, due to the large size of real-world tensors, even extracting these features can be computationally expensive without careful optimization. To address these limitations, we have developed a smart sparse tensor generator that replicates key characteristics of real sparse tensors. Additionally, we propose efficient methods for extracting a comprehensive set of sparse tensor features. The effectiveness of our generator is validated through the quality of extracted features and the performance of decomposition on the generated tensors. Both the sparse tensor feature extractor and the tensor generator are open source with all the artifacts available at https://github.com/sparcityeu/FeaTensor and https://github.com/sparcityeu/GenTensor, respectively.

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.

Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely applied and has shown its benefits in different machine learning tasks. However, as recently observed, it may have an unfair effect in multi-class classification. While data augmentation generally improves the overall performance (and therefore is beneficial for many classes), it can actually be detrimental for other classes, which can be problematic in some application domains. In this paper, to counteract this phenomenon, we propose CLAM, a CLAss-dependent Multiplicative-weights method. To derive it, we first formulate the training of a classifier as a non-linear optimization problem that aims at simultaneously maximizing the individual class performances and balancing them. By rewriting this optimization problem as an adversarial two-player game, we propose a novel multiplicative weight algorithm, for which we prove the convergence. Interestingly, our formulation also reveals that the class-dependent effects of data augmentation is not due to data augmentation only, but is in fact a general phenomenon. Our empirical results over six datasets demonstrate that the performance of learned classifiers is indeed more fairly distributed over classes, with only limited impact on the average accuracy.

Abstract: We consider the problem of asynchronous stochastic optimization, where an optimization algorithm makes updates based on stale stochastic gradients of the objective that are subject to an arbitrary (possibly adversarial) sequence of delays. We present a procedure which, for any given $q \in (0,1]$, transforms any standard stochastic first-order method to an asynchronous method with convergence guarantee depending on the $q$-quantile delay of the sequence. This approach leads to convergence rates of the form $O(\tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems, where $\tau_q$ is the $q$-quantile delay, generalizing and improving on existing results that depend on the average delay. We further show a method that automatically adapts to all quantiles simultaneously, without any prior knowledge of the delays, achieving convergence rates of the form $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q/qT+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for non-convex and $O(\inf_{q} \tau_q^2/(q T)^2+\sigma/\sqrt{qT})$ for convex smooth problems. Our technique is based on asynchronous mini-batching with a careful batch-size selection and filtering of stale gradients.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) cooperation has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the perception limitations of classical autonomous driving by leveraging information from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensors. However, effectively fusing heterogeneous visual and semantic information while ensuring robust trajectory planning remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces V2X-VLM, a novel end-to-end (E2E) cooperative autonomous driving framework based on vision-language models (VLMs). V2X-VLM integrates multiperspective camera views from vehicles and infrastructure with text-based scene descriptions to enable a more comprehensive understanding of driving environments. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning-based mechanism to reinforce the alignment of heterogeneous visual and textual characteristics, which enhances the semantic understanding of complex driving scenarios, and employ a knowledge distillation strategy to stabilize training. Experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that V2X-VLM achieves state-of-the-art trajectory planning accuracy, significantly reducing L2 error and collision rate compared to existing cooperative autonomous driving baselines. Ablation studies validate the contributions of each component. Moreover, the evaluation of robustness and efficiency highlights the practicality of V2X-VLM for real-world deployment to enhance overall autonomous driving safety and decision-making.

Abstract: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

<title>Learning to Route LLMs with Confidence Tokens</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on several tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, especially in high-stakes settings, it becomes vital to know when the output of an LLM may be unreliable. Depending on whether an answer is trustworthy, a system can then choose to route the question to another expert, or otherwise fall back on a safe default behavior. In this work, we study the extent to which LLMs can reliably indicate confidence in their answers, and how this notion of confidence can translate into downstream accuracy gains. We propose Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF), a lightweight training strategy to teach LLMs to express confidence in whether their answers are correct in a reliable manner. Self-REF introduces confidence tokens into the LLM, from which a confidence score can be extracted. Compared to conventional approaches such as verbalizing confidence and examining token probabilities, we demonstrate empirically that confidence tokens show significant improvements in downstream routing and rejection learning tasks.

Abstract: A Bayesian coreset is a small, weighted subset of a data set that replaces the full data during inference to reduce computational cost. The state-of-the-art coreset construction algorithm, Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo (Coreset MCMC), uses draws from an adaptive Markov chain targeting the coreset posterior to train the coreset weights via stochastic gradient optimization. However, the quality of the constructed coreset, and thus the quality of its posterior approximation, is sensitive to the stochastic optimization learning rate. In this work, we propose a learning-rate-free stochastic gradient optimization procedure, Hot-start Distance over Gradient (Hot DoG), for training coreset weights in Coreset MCMC without user tuning effort. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence of the coreset weights produced by Hot DoG. We also provide empirical results demonstrate that Hot DoG provides higher quality posterior approximations than other learning-rate-free stochastic gradient methods, and performs competitively to optimally-tuned ADAM.

<title>AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation</title>

Abstract: Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.

<title>The learned range test method for the inverse inclusion problem</title>

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem consisting of the reconstruction of an inclusion $B$ contained in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ from a single pair of Cauchy data $(u|_{\partial\Omega},\partial_\nu u|_{\partial\Omega})$, where $\Delta u=0$ in $\Omega\setminus\overline B$ and $u=0$ on $\partial B$. We show that the reconstruction algorithm based on the range test, a domain sampling method, can be written as a neural network with a specific architecture. We propose to learn the weights of this network in the framework of supervised learning, and to combine it with a pre-trained classifier, with the purpose of distinguishing the inclusions based on their distance from the boundary. The numerical simulations show that this learned range test method provides accurate and stable reconstructions of polygonal inclusions. Furthermore, the results are superior to those obtained with the standard range test method (without learning) and with an end-to-end fully connected deep neural network, a purely data-driven method.

Abstract: The combination of behavioural cloning and neural networks has driven significant progress in robotic manipulation. As these algorithms may require a large number of demonstrations for each task of interest, they remain fundamentally inefficient in complex scenarios, in which finite datasets can hardly cover the state space. One of the remaining challenges is thus out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation, i.e. the ability to predict correct actions for states with a low likelihood with respect to the state occupancy induced by the dataset. This issue is aggravated when the system to control is treated as a black-box, ignoring its physical properties. This work characterises widespread properties of robotic manipulation, specifically pose equivariance and locality. We investigate the effect of the choice of problem space on OOD performance of BC policies and how transformations arising from characteristic properties of manipulation could be employed for its improvement. We empirically demonstrate that these transformations allow behaviour cloning policies, using either standard MLP-based one-step action prediction or diffusion-based action-sequence prediction, to generalise better to OOD problem instances.

arXiv:2411.05261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in automated report generation, the opaqueness of text interpretability continues to cast doubt on the reliability of the content produced. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify specific image features in X-ray images that influence the outputs of report generation models. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Vision-Language Manipulator CVLM, a module to generate a manipulated X-ray from an original X-ray and its report from a designated report generator. The essence of CVLM is that cycling manipulated X-rays to the report generator produces altered reports aligned with the alterations pre-injected into the reports for X-ray generation, achieving the term "cyclic manipulation". This process allows direct comparison between original and manipulated X-rays, clarifying the critical image features driving changes in reports and enabling model users to assess the reliability of the generated texts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CVLM can identify more precise and reliable features compared to existing explanation methods, significantly enhancing the transparency and applicability of AI-generated reports.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has created an urgent need for their scientific quantification. While their fluency across a variety of domains is impressive, AI systems fall short on tests requiring algorithmic reasoning -- a glaring limitation given the necessity for interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge of reasoning benchmarks emerging from the academic community, no theoretical framework exists to quantify algorithmic reasoning in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from computational complexity theory to quantify algorithmic generalization using algebraic expressions: algebraic circuit complexity. Algebraic circuit complexity theory -- the study of algebraic expressions as circuit models -- is a natural framework to study the complexity of algorithmic computation. Algebraic circuit complexity enables the study of generalization by defining benchmarks in terms of the computational requirements to solve a problem. Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical objects; an arbitrarily large number of samples can be generated for a specified circuit, making it an ideal experimental sandbox for the data-hungry models that are used today. In this Perspective, we adopt tools from algebraic circuit complexity, apply them to formalize a science of algorithmic generalization, and address key challenges for its successful application to AI science.

Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: We introduce a unified, flexible, and easy-to-implement framework of sufficient dimension reduction that can accommodate both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, and both the conditional distribution and the conditional mean as the targets of estimation. This unified framework is achieved by a specially structured neural network -- the Belted and Ensembled Neural Network (BENN) -- that consists of a narrow latent layer, which we call the belt, and a family of transformations of the response, which we call the ensemble. By strategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we can achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing the appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for the conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the advantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming a computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction estimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or n. We develop the algorithm and convergence rate of our method, compare it with existing sufficient dimension reduction methods, and apply it to two data examples.

<title>Deep learning joint extremes of metocean variables using the SPAR model</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for estimating multivariate joint extremes of metocean variables, based on the Semi-Parametric Angular-Radial (SPAR) model. When considered in polar coordinates, the problem of modelling multivariate extremes is transformed to one of modelling an angular density, and the tail of a univariate radial variable conditioned on angle. In the SPAR approach, the tail of the radial variable is modelled using a generalised Pareto (GP) distribution, providing a natural extension of univariate extreme value theory to the multivariate setting. In this work, we show how the method can be applied in higher dimensions, using a case study for five metocean variables: wind speed, wind direction, wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The angular variable is modelled using a kernel density method, while the parameters of the GP model are approximated using fully-connected deep neural networks. Our approach provides great flexibility in the dependence structures that can be represented, together with computationally efficient routines for training the model. Furthermore, the application of the method requires fewer assumptions about the underlying distribution(s) compared to existing approaches, and an asymptotically justified means for extrapolating outside the range of observations. Using various diagnostic plots, we show that the fitted models provide a good description of the joint extremes of the metocean variables considered.

Abstract: Inferring object 3D position and orientation from a single RGB camera is a foundational task in computer vision with many important applications. Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring LiDAR and vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured.
  We present a novel method to train a 3D object detector from a single RGB camera without domain-specific human annotations, making orders of magnitude more data available for training. The method uses newly proposed Local Object Motion Model to disentangle object movement source between subsequent frames, is approximately 700 times faster than previous work and compensates camera focal length differences to aggregate multiple datasets.
  The method is evaluated on three public datasets, where despite using no human labels, it outperforms prior work by a significant margin. It also shows its versatility as a pre-training tool for fully-supervised training and shows that combining pseudo-labels from multiple datasets can achieve comparable accuracy to using human labels from a single dataset. The source code and model are available at https://github.com/jskvrna/MonoSOWA.

Abstract: The tradeoff between reconstruction quality and compute required for video super-resolution (VSR) remains a formidable challenge in its adoption for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While transformer-based VSR models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years, these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand, lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, RNA and even cells. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (NatureLM), a sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) top performance across different domains, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist models. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.

Abstract: In high-noise environments such as factories, subways, and busy streets, capturing clear speech is challenging. Throat microphones can offer a solution because of their inherent noise-suppression capabilities; however, the passage of sound waves through skin and tissue attenuates high-frequency information, reducing speech clarity. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in enhancing throat microphone recordings, but further progress is constrained by the lack of a standard dataset. Here, we introduce the Throat and Acoustic Paired Speech (TAPS) dataset, a collection of paired utterances recorded from 60 native Korean speakers using throat and acoustic microphones. Furthermore, an optimal alignment approach was developed and applied to address the inherent signal mismatch between the two microphones. We tested three baseline deep learning models on the TAPS dataset and found mapping-based approaches to be superior for improving speech quality and restoring content. These findings demonstrate the TAPS dataset's utility for speech enhancement tasks and support its potential as a standard resource for advancing research in throat microphone-based applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for simulating conditioned diffusion processes (diffusion bridges) in Euclidean spaces. By training a neural network to approximate bridge dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or score modeling. Compared to existing methods, it offers greater robustness across various diffusion specifications and conditioning scenarios. This applies in particular to rare events and multimodal distributions, which pose challenges for score-learning- and MCMC-based approaches. We introduce a flexible variational family, partially specified by a neural network, for approximating the diffusion bridge path measure. Once trained, it enables efficient sampling of independent bridges at a cost comparable to sampling the unconditioned (forward) process.

Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Group-MATES, an efficient group-level data selection approach to optimize the speed-quality frontier of language model pretraining. Specifically, Group-MATES parameterizes costly group-level selection with a relational data influence model. To train this model, we sample training trajectories of the language model and collect oracle data influences alongside. The relational data influence model approximates the oracle data influence by weighting individual influence with relationships among training data. To enable efficient selection with our relational data influence model, we partition the dataset into small clusters using relationship weights and select data within each cluster independently. Experiments on DCLM 400M-4x, 1B-1x, and 3B-1x show that Group-MATES achieves 3.5%-9.4% relative performance gains over random selection across 22 downstream tasks, nearly doubling the improvements achieved by state-of-the-art individual data selection baselines. Furthermore, Group-MATES reduces the number of tokens required to reach a certain downstream performance by up to 1.75x, substantially elevating the speed-quality frontier. Further analyses highlight the critical role of relationship weights in the relational data influence model and the effectiveness of our cluster-based inference.

Abstract: For robots to operate in general environments like households, they must be able to perform non-prehensile manipulation actions such as toppling and rolling to manipulate ungraspable objects. However, prior works on non-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with diverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying environmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and ceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the step's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such variability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn diverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we propose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures network modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric variability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation (CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for generating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the resulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and objects despite training entirely within a simulator. We additionally release a simulation-based benchmark featuring nine digital twins of real-world scenes with 353 objects to facilitate non-prehensile manipulation research in realistic domains.

<title>AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation</title>

Abstract: In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.

Abstract: While the Question Generation (QG) task has been increasingly adopted in educational assessments, its evaluation remains limited by approaches that lack a clear connection to the educational values of test items. In this work, we introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our extensive experiments and human evaluation study, the additional perspectives introduced by the simulated student profiles lead to a more effective and robust assessment of test items.

<title>Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08558</link>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

Abstract: Indoor navigation presents unique challenges due to complex layouts and the unavailability of GNSS signals. Existing solutions often struggle with contextual adaptation, and typically require dedicated hardware. In this work, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e., ChatGPT, to generate natural, context-aware navigation instructions from indoor map images. We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 86.59% correct indications and a maximum of 97.14%. The proposed system achieves high accuracy and reasoning performance. These results have key implications for AI-driven navigation and assistive technologies.

Abstract: Change point detection has become an important part of the analysis of the single-particle tracking data, as it allows one to identify moments, in which the motion patterns of observed particles undergo significant changes. The segmentation of diffusive trajectories based on those moments may provide insight into various phenomena in soft condensed matter and biological physics. In this paper, we propose CINNAMON, a hybrid approach to classifying single-particle tracking trajectories, detecting change points within them, and estimating diffusion parameters in the segments between the change points. Our method is based on a combination of neural networks, feature-based machine learning, and statistical techniques. It has been benchmarked in the second Anomalous Diffusion Challenge. The method offers a high level of interpretability due to its analytical and feature-based components. A potential use of features from topological data analysis is also discussed.

<title>Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack</title>

Abstract: Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.

Abstract: We consider a patch-based learning approach defined in terms of neural networks to estimate spatially adaptive regularisation parameter maps for image denoising with weighted Total Variation (TV) and test it to situations when the noise distribution is unknown. As an example, we consider situations where noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of optimal scalar regularisation.

<title>DeepGDel: Deep Learning-based Gene Deletion Prediction Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>

Abstract: In genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are crucial for achieving growth-coupled production, where cell growth and target metabolite production are simultaneously achieved. While computational methods for calculating gene deletions have been widely explored and contribute to developing gene deletion strategy databases, current approaches are limited in leveraging new data-driven paradigms, such as machine learning, for more efficient strain design. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a fundamental framework for this objective. In this study, we first formulate the problem of gene deletion strategy prediction and then propose a framework for predicting gene deletion strategies for growth-coupled production in genome-scale metabolic models. The proposed framework leverages deep learning algorithms to learn and integrate sequential gene and metabolite data representation, enabling the automatic gene deletion strategy prediction. Computational experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods. Specifically, the proposed framework achieves a 14.69%, 22.52%, and 13.03% increase in overall accuracy across three metabolic models of different scales under study, while maintaining balanced precision and recall in predicting gene deletion statuses. The source code and examples for the framework are publicly available at https://github.com/MetNetComp/DeepGDel.

Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.

Abstract: Reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image analysis often depend on large and diverse labeled datasets. Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems have underscored the complementary strengths of generative modeling and pretrained language models. We propose HSTU-BLaIR, a hybrid framework that augments the Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit (HSTU)-based generative recommender with BLaIR, a lightweight contrastive text embedding model. This integration enriches item representations with semantic signals from textual metadata while preserving HSTU's powerful sequence modeling capabilities.
  We evaluate HSTU-BLaIR on two e-commerce datasets: three subsets from the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset and the Steam dataset. We compare its performance against both the original HSTU-based recommender and a variant augmented with embeddings from OpenAI's state-of-the-art \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model. Despite the latter being trained on a substantially larger corpus with significantly more parameters, our lightweight BLaIR-enhanced approach -- pretrained on domain-specific data -- achieves better performance in nearly all cases. Specifically, HSTU-BLaIR outperforms the OpenAI embedding-based variant on all but one metric, where it is marginally lower, and matches it on another. These findings highlight the effectiveness of contrastive text embeddings in compute-efficient recommendation settings.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models. https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models

Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with 2 to 5 components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverage a phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We use this structure to incorporate side information and develop models that can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables more accurate signal detection, yields lower estimation error, reduced false discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs.We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.

Abstract: Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism with monetary transfers that is budget balanced and enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FeMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees, and better model performance for all agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

<title>AnchorFormer: Differentiable Anchor Attention for Efficient Vision Transformer</title>

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches. Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiably learn these anchors and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. It avoids the burden caused by non-differentiable operations and further speeds up the approximate attention. Moreover, we extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification, detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Abstract: Performativity of predictions refers to the phenomena that prediction-informed decisions may influence the target they aim to predict, which is widely observed in policy-making in social sciences and economics. In this paper, we initiate the study of statistical inference under performativity. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we build a central limit theorem for estimation and inference under performativity, which enables inferential purposes in policy-making such as constructing confidence intervals or testing hypotheses. Second, we further leverage the derived central limit theorem to investigate prediction-powered inference (PPI) under performativity, which is based on a small labeled dataset and a much larger dataset of machine-learning predictions. This enables us to obtain more precise estimation and improved confidence regions for the model parameter (i.e., policy) of interest in performative prediction. We demonstrate the power of our framework by numerical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to establish statistical inference under performativity, which brings up new challenges and inference settings that we believe will add significant values to policy-making, statistics, and machine learning.

Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

<title>Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study of Conditional Effectiveness</title>

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

<title>Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback</title>

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups, particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g., statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g., predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics} provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database (Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.

Summary: 
Clinical decision-making is complex due to cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in supporting clinical decisions but may overlook real-world complexities. The proposed hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, facilitates multi-step dialogues between physicians and LLMs to refine diagnoses and treatments. Unlike static tools, MedSyn allows dynamic exchanges, enabling physicians to challenge LLM suggestions and vice versa. Simulated interactions demonstrate the potential of open-source LLMs as effective physician assistants. The results indicate the promising role of open-source LLMs in real-world clinical practice. Further validation through real physician interactions will assess MedSyn's impact on diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Summary: 
The article introduces a two-dimensional extension of the parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) to address challenges in practical implementations of Ising machines, which are used for sampling Boltzmann probability distributions in machine learning and optimization. The 2D-PT algorithm adds a second dimension of replicas to handle soft constraints effectively, ensuring constraint satisfaction in the final replicas. This approach improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to tune penalty strengths explicitly. In experiments involving graph sparsification and sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT demonstrates near-ideal mixing and significantly faster performance compared to conventional PT. The method has broad applications in constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines. <div>

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Summary:
Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved with specialized "species" like DeepSeek-V3 and NetraAI. NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework, uses contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. It embeds features in a metric space, contracts them towards stable attractors, and defines latent subgroups. This framework explores higher-order feature interactions, selects compact, explainable bundles ("Personas"), and utilizes an LLM Strategist for guided discovery. In case studies on schizophrenia, depression, and pancreatic cancer, NetraAI uncovered high-effect-size subpopulations, enhancing weak baseline models into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. Positioned at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, NetraAI aligns with emerging reasoning paradigms like Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Summary:
The paper introduces a transfer learning methodology to predict onflow parameters like angle of attack and onflow speed. The approach involves training a ConvNet offline for the core prediction task, freezing most of the weights, and retraining selected layers for transfer learning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this method using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil. It shows successful adaptation to changing data distribution through domain and task adaptation. However, the approach is found to be less effective in handling noisy data. The study also explores performance on an extended domain and investigates the impact of sampling sizes and architectures. Overall, the results showcase the potential of transfer learning for real-time learning in applications such as wind tunnel testing and aerodynamic performance analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.

<div> forecasting, multimodal, satellite imagery, physics-informed, deep learning

Summary:
The article introduces physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE) as a method to embed physical information into vision language models for multimodal time series forecasting. PIPE incorporates a physics-informed positional indexing scheme and a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism to capture both physical and sequential order information. By enhancing multimodal alignment, PIPE significantly improves forecasting accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance in deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods. Experimental results on a large satellite image dataset show a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting compared to prior works. The proposed method fills a gap in existing approaches that primarily focus on utilizing text data for forecasting, leaving visual data untapped. PIPE showcases the importance of incorporating physical information from satellite imagery for more accurate and reliable forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Summary: <br />
The study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize retrieval operations in multi-deep storage systems with items of varying characteristics and due dates. A graph-based state representation is introduced to capture the system's topology, integrating item attributes and warehouse structure. A novel neural network architecture combining Graph Neural Network and Transformer models is designed to process this representation, enabling efficient retrieval prioritization. The Transformer's strong generalization capability allows the approach to be applied to diverse warehouse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over heuristic methods in minimizing retrieval tardiness. <div>

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data, carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical decision making and individualized care in T1D.

<title>Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting</title>

<div> Concept Drift, Time Series, Online Predictions, Continuous Evolution Pool, Knowledge Retention<br />
<br />Summary:<br />
Recurring concept drift in time series data poses a challenge for online predictions as previously learned concepts may resurface over time, leading to a decline in prediction accuracy. Existing solutions focus on parameter updating techniques, potentially sacrificing previous knowledge. To address this, the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP) is proposed to store multiple forecasters for different concepts. The method selects the nearest forecaster to a test sample, learns from neighboring samples, and evolves new models as new concepts emerge, ensuring retention of knowledge. Experimental results with various models and real datasets show that CEP effectively retains concept knowledge and improves prediction accuracy in scenarios with recurring concepts. <div>
arXiv:2506.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

<div> Keywords: Protein Language Models, dropout layer, inference time, zero-shot prediction, ProteinGym dataset<br />
Summary: <br />
Protein Language Models (PLMs) like ESM2 can predict key protein properties without specific training. The study introduces a dropout layer at inference time between the PLM's featurizer and transformer, enhancing zero-shot performance on the ProteinGym dataset. This improvement occurs even without initial dropout training and doesn't necessitate retraining or fine-tuning the PLM. A dropout rate of 0.1 is effective across various models. The findings suggest that incorporating dropout layers during inference can boost PLM performance in predicting protein properties. <div>
arXiv:2506.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

<div> Keywords: FLOPs, pretraining, Mixture-of-Experts, linear time, model variants <br />
Summary: 
Requiring a large number of FLOPs for pretraining an 8-bit weight in a Large Language Model (LLM) is deemed inefficient. A new construction method called "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) allows for the creation of child models from existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Individually interpolating model weight tensors enables enhancement or suppression of semantic features from the parents. By varying the proportion of weights from parent models, gradual changes in the behaviors of AoE child models are observed as well as the emergence of new traits. Surprisingly, nearly all generated models are found to be functional. The DeepSeek R1T "Chimera" hybrid model created through this method exhibits a combination of traits from its parent models, achieving a high level of intelligence similar to the R1 model while improving processing speed compared to the V3 model. The Chimera demonstrates compact and orderly reasoning without the need for fine-tuning or distillation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

<div> trade-off, representational similarity, generalization, identification, deep networks
<br />
The study explores the tradeoff between structured and selective internal representations in intelligent systems. It introduces a limit to this tradeoff, showing that a model's probability of correct generalization and identification are constrained by the decay of representational similarity with semantic resolution. The analysis extends to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and predicts a collapse in multi-input processing capacity as well as a non-monotonic optimum for generalization. A minimal ReLU network demonstrates these theoretical findings during learning. The study also extends to more complex settings, such as convolutional neural networks and vision-language models, indicating a universal constraint on representational capacity due to finite-resolution similarity. Overall, the research provides an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and highlights the role of semantic resolution in shaping the capabilities of deep networks and biological brains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

The paper introduces ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model for improving time series forecasting by combining semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Leveraging the Mamba selective state space model, ss-Mamba achieves similar performance to Transformer architectures while drastically reducing computational complexity. The use of semantic index embeddings, derived from pretrained language models, enables effective generalization to unseen series by incorporating meaningful semantic priors.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based models in time-series forecasting.

Summary: This paper presents a continuous time approximation for the discrete Heavy-Ball momentum method, focusing on the explicit discretization error. By studying the HB method in continuous time and incorporating counter terms to handle the discretization error, a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation is designed.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Summary: 
Vision language models (VLMs) are models that combine visual input with language prompts and are widely used in various applications. This study investigates the sensitivity of VLMs to different types of prompts and variations. The research introduces a framework called PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration) to analyze prompt sensitivity in VLMs. The evaluation using PARC shows that VLMs exhibit prompt sensitivity similar to large language models (LLMs) in the vision domain, with certain variations leading to significant changes in the model's output. Among the 22 models evaluated, VLMs from the InternVL2 family demonstrate remarkable robustness to prompt variations. Additionally, there are indications that prompt sensitivity in VLMs may be influenced by the training data. The code for this analysis framework will be available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

The framework dynamically selects suitable forecasting models for each product based on its demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, the approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies for smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes. Experiments on the Favorita dataset show that the deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) compared to single-model benchmarks, with 4.67x faster inference time. The enhanced forecasting precision achieved through this framework can lead to significant reductions in stockouts and excess inventory, highlighting the importance of intelligent AI in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Summary: 
This article introduces a method to improve the detailed visual reasoning of vision-language models by using external tools like zoom. The approach involves training smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and enhancing the model's ability to utilize external tools efficiently. By incorporating a simple reward structure, a streamlined tool-calling interface, allocating more tokens to the tool-called results, and increasing visually challenging examples in the training data, the method outperforms baseline models on visual question-answering tasks. The key advantage lies in the detailed visual information provided by the external tools, leading to enhanced performance in scenarios where compute resources are limited. <div>

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Federated Learning, NanoEdge, NanoAdapters, Privacy

Summary:
FedNano introduces a novel approach to Federated Learning for large Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that centralizes the LLM on the server while utilizing a lightweight client-side module called NanoEdge. NanoEdge incorporates modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation to handle client-specific adaptation without deploying the full model on clients. This design significantly reduces client-side storage by 95% and communication overhead to just 0.01% of the model parameters, addressing the challenges posed by high computational demands, limited client capacity, and heterogeneous client data in FL for MLLMs. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano ensures privacy preservation while enabling scalable and decentralized multimodal AI systems. Experimental results demonstrate that FedNano outperforms existing FL baselines, showcasing its ability to bridge the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Summary: <br />
This study evaluates the performance of four surrogate models in predicting material properties of high-entropy alloys using a combination of experimental and computational data. The models tested are conventional Gaussian Processes, Deep Gaussian Processes, encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost. The evaluation focuses on predicting correlated material properties such as yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under different conditions, alongside additional computational properties. The comparison highlights the effectiveness of deep and hierarchical modeling approaches in handling diverse and incomplete data commonly found in materials informatics. The study demonstrates that Deep Gaussian Processes, especially when combined with machine learning-based priors, outperform other surrogate models by accurately capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. Advanced surrogate models show promising results in enabling robust and data-efficient materials design. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Summary:
The paper introduces Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) in small-scale one-class classification tasks. The proposed method enhances the OC-SVM by incorporating negative samples without using any labels during model optimization. By improving the kernel with negative data, GRKneg consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM with Radial Basis Function kernel. Additionally, comparisons with binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) show that the proposed approach performs better than binary SVM when the number of negative samples is low. This indicates the effectiveness of GRKneg in handling one-class classification tasks when negative samples are limited. These findings demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in improving the performance of OC-SVM in scenarios with limited negative sample availability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms the binary SVM.

<div> Keywords: Online learning, Vertical Federated Learning, Event-driven framework, Dynamic Local Regret, Non-convex models

Summary: 
In the field of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), the integration of online learning poses unique challenges due to clients having non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. This article introduces the concept of an event-driven online VFL framework to address these challenges. The framework activates only a subset of clients during each event, while others passively collaborate. The framework incorporates Dynamic Local Regret (DLR) to handle online learning problems with non-convex models in a non-stationary environment. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed framework outperformed existing online VFL frameworks in terms of stability, communication, and computation costs under non-stationary data conditions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Summary:
Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show promise in overcoming data-related issues in digital security. The classification of extraction errors in AE is crucial for effective detection, as it directly impacts performance. This study introduces an automated approach to defining the separation threshold using machine learning algorithms. Three algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, and Support Vector Machine, were evaluated for this purpose. The study aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection in digital security by automatically determining the threshold. This approach can streamline the detection process and enhance the overall security mechanism's effectiveness. Automatic threshold determination can help address data imbalances and optimize anomaly detection systems for enhanced performance and reliability.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Summary: 
The article explores the structure of loss landscapes in neural networks, identifying channels where the loss decreases slowly while output weights of two neurons diverge to infinity. These channels lead to the emergence of gated linear units, where two neurons exhibit a specific behavior at convergence. Gradient flow solvers and optimization methods like SGD or ADAM are likely to encounter these channels in regression settings. Despite appearing as flat local minima, the channels are characterized by unique gradient dynamics, geometric properties, and functional interpretation. The discovery of gated linear units at the end of these channels showcases the computational capabilities of fully connected layers in neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2506.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning abilities, but previous efforts have been limited to specific domains like math and code. The lack of reliable and scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains has been a key challenge. To address this, the researchers introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus with 92K verifiable examples spanning six domains: Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular. They find that different domains exhibit varying levels of improvement with RL training, with domains like Math, Code, and Science benefiting from cross-domain training while Logic, Simulation, and Tabular require in-domain training for performance gains. The models trained on Guru, Guru-7B, and Guru-32B, outperform existing baselines on a 17-task evaluation suite across the six reasoning domains, showcasing their effectiveness in enhancing reasoning abilities across diverse domains. The data, models, and code are released to facilitate general-purpose reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD) for estimating the error of machine learning models in unseen test domains. Unlike the traditional method that competes in the overlapping region between source and target domains, ODD focuses on disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, leading to more accurate error bounds. By utilizing domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap, ODD improves performance estimation error and remains reliable. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ODD in predicting target performance compared to the existing disagreement discrepancy method (DIS^2). The code and results of the study are available on GitHub.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Summary: 
This study aims to predict disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using a combination of clinical data and daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. Despite the challenge of early prediction, advanced models such as state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs) along with a custom multimodal attention-based transformer were employed. Integrating digital data with clinical data improved prediction performance, with the multimodal transformer consistently outperforming its unimodal counterpart. The best results were obtained using a transformer model with unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM. This study highlights the potential of FMs and multimodal approaches to generate more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases by extracting predictive signals from diverse clinical and digital life sciences data. <div>

We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

<div> probing framework, multi-agent multi-armed bandit, fairness, submodular properties, regret

Summary:
The article introduces a novel multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework that focuses on achieving fair outcomes among agents while maximizing system performance. Decision-making in this framework is challenging due to limited information about arm rewards, which is addressed by a strategic probing framework that gathers information about arms before allocation. In the offline setting where reward distributions are known, a greedy probing algorithm based on submodular properties is designed with a provable performance bound. For the online setting, an algorithm is developed to achieve sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of fairness and efficiency.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, sepsis treatment, state representations, Controlled Differential Equations, MIMIC-III cohort<br />
Summary:<br />
This article discusses the importance of stable state representations in reinforcement learning for sepsis treatment using ICU time series data. The key factors identified for successful reinforcement learning policies are training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods and enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores. Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation is proposed as a method to achieve strong RL policies. Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort show that stable CDE autoencoders produce representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enable superior RL policies. Unstable CDE representations lead to degraded representations and policy failure. Visualizations of the latent space generated by stable CDEs reveal clear patterns separating survivor and non-survivor trajectories, as well as acuity score gradients, while unstable training fails to capture these patterns. These findings provide practical guidelines for using CDEs in encoding irregular medical time series for clinical RL applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.

<div> Keywords: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models, Token Grouping, Optimization, Empirical Evaluation

Summary:
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO) introduces a new approach that considers token importance in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By grouping tokens based on their relevance, SFT-GO optimizes the model using a combination of worst-group loss and standard cross-entropy loss. This adaptive emphasis on challenging token groups improves learning dynamics and convergence rate efficiency. Empirical results show that models trained with SFT-GO outperform baseline methods on popular LLM benchmarks across various datasets and base models. The three token grouping strategies implemented in SFT-GO demonstrate robustness and effectiveness in enhancing model performance. Overall, SFT-GO provides a promising technique for improving the fine-tuning process of LLMs by prioritizing important tokens for better task alignment and performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO) enhances large language model (LLM) training by considering token importance, grouping tokens, and optimizing model using a combination of worst-group loss and cross-entropy loss. This adaptive approach improves learning dynamics, convergence rate efficiency, and task performance, outperforming baseline methods on popular LLM benchmarks. Empirical evaluation shows the robustness and effectiveness of SFT-GO across various datasets and base models, demonstrating its potential for improving fine-tuning processes of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2506.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

<div> pretraining, large language models, model architecture, parametrization, vocabulary size <br />
<br />Summary: 
This article introduces a new method called $\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) that optimizes model architecture and parametrization to make pretraining large language models more efficient. While $\mu P has shown promising results, recent empirical studies have raised concerns about its application to Large Language Models (LLMs). The article addresses the limitations of $\mu P theory, particularly the assumption of a fixed input dimension, and analyzes the impact of vocabulary size on training dynamics. It proposes a new regime called the Large Vocab (LV) Regime, where optimal scaling rules differ from those predicted by $\mu P. In the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{width}), which aligns with empirical findings. Experiments validate the theoretical analysis, and pretraining a 1B model from scratch demonstrates the benefits of the suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

Summary:
Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG) introduces a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization, inspired by the DeepSeek-V3 architecture. By incorporating temporary modules into the base model, SPG can efficiently generate state-action trajectories in a single forward pass, reducing computational costs. Experimental results show that models retrained with SPG on original datasets exhibit improved performance compared to standard transfer fine-tuning methods. The method is evaluated across diverse datasets in computer vision, natural language processing, and audio tasks, demonstrating consistent performance gains ranging from 0.2% to 7%. The SPG approach offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and effectiveness, making it a promising tool for industrial applications. The research provides fully reproducible code and pre-trained models for further exploration.

arXiv:2506.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

<div> optimization algorithms, deep learning, Muon optimizer, theoretical analysis, Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family

Summary: 
This paper delves into the theoretical underpinnings of the Muon optimizer in the context of the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers. It establishes that Muon can be seen as a member of the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family when utilizing the nuclear norm. The analysis reveals that Muon, with decoupled weight decay, implicitly tackles an optimization problem that enforces constraints on the spectral norm of weight matrices. Understanding this relationship elucidates the implicit regularization effects of Muon and opens up avenues for further exploration by varying the convex map $\mathcal{K}$, enabling the investigation of a wider range of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2506.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

Summary: 
The article introduces a progressive framework called HiPreNets for training and tuning high-precision neural networks. It addresses the challenges of training accurate models in complex problems by refining a staged training technique. The approach involves sequentially learning prediction residuals using additional networks to improve overall accuracy. The framework considers the structure of residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters, and adapt data sampling techniques. It focuses on minimizing $L^{\infty}$ error, crucial in many applications, rather than solely prioritizing minimizing mean squared error. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through several benchmark problems. <div>
arXiv:2506.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as the cognitive core of embodied agents but can suffer from inherited hallucinations due to failures in grounding user instructions in the physical environment. This study investigates the occurrence and triggers of hallucinations in LLM-based agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. By creating a hallucination probing set, the study induced high hallucination rates and evaluated 12 models in two simulation environments. Results show that while models demonstrate reasoning abilities, they struggle to resolve inconsistencies, revealing limitations in handling infeasible tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model for robust traffic data imputation in intelligent transportation systems. It combines low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning to address missing data issues caused by sensor failures. The model embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture using learnable projections, encoding sparse traffic tensors into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism incorporates Hadamard products to model multilinear interactions, with multilayer perceptron layers refining these representations. Evaluations on urban traffic datasets show NCPF outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines. By uniting interpretable factor analysis with nonlinear expressive power, NCPF offers a principled and flexible approach for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, supporting transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems. <div>

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

Summary: 
This paper presents a structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods, addressing the challenge of ensuring the successful execution of unlearning operations in machine learning models for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance. The proposed taxonomy categorizes existing techniques into behavioral verification and parametric verification based on the evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. The paper examines representative methods within each category, discussing their assumptions, strengths, limitations, and potential vulnerabilities. By identifying open problems in current verification research, the paper aims to lay a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms. Overall, this survey contributes to a better understanding of machine unlearning verification and highlights the need for further research in this critical area.

arXiv:2506.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

arXiv:2506.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Summary: 
Skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) is introduced as a framework for understanding animal behaviors by inferring interpretable skill sets through representation learning on transition probabilities and parameterizing policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. The approach, validated on various tasks, identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories. SKIL offers a concise and principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives. By leveraging generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, SKIL provides a more nuanced understanding of how animals flexibly recombine core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands. <div>

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Summary:
This work focuses on quantifying the accuracy of applying machine learning techniques to the 1D Poisson differential equation using numerical analysis. The study highlights the importance of function space of data and generalization of models. By analyzing training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters, the researchers prove generalization bounds and convergence rates. Empirical replication of analytically derived generalization bounds reveals varied generalization behaviors across different model classes. Furthermore, the study uncovers potential lack of generalization to the true physical equation in various cases, including deep linear models and neural networks. The researchers also introduce a mechanistic interpretability lens to extract Green's function representations from black-box model weights. A new cross-validation technique is proposed for measuring generalization in physical systems, with the Poisson equation suggested as an evaluation benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

It uses the Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure to extract principal components of weight updates into compact Kronecker factors, and an adaptive rank selection algorithm to prune negligible components based on energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria. Empirical evaluation on various language and reasoning tasks shows that SoKA requires fewer trainable parameters than existing methods while achieving similar or better performance. It also demonstrates faster convergence and more stable gradients, indicating robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

<div> Keywords: Federated learning, Byzantine behavior, convergence, validity conditions, lower bound<br />
<br />
Summary: <br /> 
The article explores the robustness of federated learning to Byzantine behavior and investigates the tradeoff between the average/centroid and validity conditions in distributed computing. It establishes a lower bound of min{(n-t)/t, sqrt{d}} on centroid approximation under box validity. Additionally, it presents an upper bound of 2min{n, sqrt{d}} and a new algorithm achieving a sqrt{2d}-approximation under convex validity. These bounds are shown to be achievable in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. The article also includes empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings, demonstrating the practical implications of the theoretical results. Overall, the study highlights the challenges posed by Byzantine outliers in federated learning and provides insights into addressing these issues through rigorous analysis and algorithm design. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Summary: 
A new approach has been developed to address the issue of unauthorized data usage by Large Language Models (LLMs). By creating synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution and calibrating likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, this method enables Dataset Inference (DI) to detect the original training sets with high confidence. This synthetic data can be used as a held-out set to verify unauthorized use, empowering copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage. Extensive experiments on text datasets demonstrate the reliability of this approach for real-world litigations. The code for this method is available on GitHub, facilitating its implementation and further research in the field. <div>

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

<div> Keywords: Battery-electric vehicles, infrastructure planning, geo-computational framework, Voronoi tessellation, GNN-driven approach

Summary: 
DOVA-PATBM is a new framework designed to optimize the deployment of charging infrastructure for battery-electric vehicles on a state-wide or national scale. By integrating various data sources and utilizing graph neural networks, this framework aims to strike a balance between urban, suburban, and rural charging needs. Results from applying DOVA-PATBM to Georgia show significant improvements in coverage, reduction of travel distance to chargers for low-income residents, and ensuring adequate power capacity. The method combines grid-based analysis, centrality modeling, and queueing theory to efficiently select charging locations while meeting coverage and equity targets. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a comprehensive, data-driven approach in bridging the gap between theoretical optimization and practical policy implementation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

<title>When and How Unlabeled Data Provably Improve In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

<title>Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

<title>Acoustic Waveform Inversion with Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository https://github.com/stankevich-mipt/seismic_inversion_via_I2SB.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

<title>Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Under Partial Observability</title>

arXiv:2506.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via: https://enjeeneer.io/projects/bfms-with-memory/.

<title>Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

<title>Warping and Matching Subsequences Between Time Series</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

arXiv:2506.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

<title>RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15513</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

arXiv:2506.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.

<title>Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

We propose a compositional approach by ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence being more efficient.

<title>MicroRicci: A Greedy and Local Ricci Flow Solver for Self-Tuning Mesh Smoothing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

<title>LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However, the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing. To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

<title>AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning</title>

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

<title>CAWR: Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression for Robust Policy Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15654</link>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

<title>Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679</link>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

<title>Dynamic ASR Pathways: An Adaptive Masking Approach Towards Efficient Pruning of A Multilingual ASR Model</title>

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

<title>See What I Mean? CUE: A Cognitive Model of Understanding Explanations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

<title>WebXAII: an open-source web framework to study human-XAI interaction</title>

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples. Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies. However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically, researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a streamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/biomap-research/PFMBench}{\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code, benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Character-Representation-Media-FF7B

<title>Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and usefulness of our guide.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare, social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI, achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects "fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful AI collaborations.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

<title>Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

<title>Efficient Serving of LLM Applications with Probabilistic Demand Modeling</title>

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

<title>Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching</title>

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability. On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

<title>Efficient Retail Video Annotation: A Robust Key Frame Generation Approach for Product and Customer Interaction Analysis</title>

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question. The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

<title>Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent interest.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme. Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics classification tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a private set for evaluation.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations. Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

<title>NeuroMoE: A Transformer-Based Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Multi-Modal Neurological Disorder Classification</title>

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our GCN-DQN model in addressing complex URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and superior network performance.

<title>Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.

<title>Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation</title>

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2) Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization. DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments.

<title>Performative Validity of Recourse Explanations</title>

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.

<title>Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding for Distributed Optimization</title>

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

<title>NERO: Explainable Out-of-Distribution Detection with Neuron-level Relevance</title>

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

<title>All is Not Lost: LLM Recovery without Checkpoints</title>

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.

<title>Co-Creative Learning via Metropolis-Hastings Interaction between Humans and AI</title>

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

<title>Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

<title>Time-dependent density estimation using binary classifiers</title>

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among real-world data.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests, has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and inverse problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

<title>A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data</title>

Abstract: Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.

Abstract: When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications, model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.

Abstract: Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as two powerful groups of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various applications to graph-based machine learning problems such as link prediction and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this Ph.D. project, GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations. Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides, we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly, we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to users, that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting, and that they permit modeling the music genre perception across cultures.

Abstract: Training algorithms, broadly construed, are an essential part of every deep learning pipeline. Training algorithm improvements that speed up training across a wide variety of workloads (e.g., better update rules, tuning protocols, learning rate schedules, or data selection schemes) could save time, save computational resources, and lead to better, more accurate, models. Unfortunately, as a community, we are currently unable to reliably identify training algorithm improvements, or even determine the state-of-the-art training algorithm. In this work, using concrete experiments, we argue that real progress in speeding up training requires new benchmarks that resolve three basic challenges faced by empirical comparisons of training algorithms: (1) how to decide when training is complete and precisely measure training time, (2) how to handle the sensitivity of measurements to exact workload details, and (3) how to fairly compare algorithms that require hyperparameter tuning. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a new, competitive, time-to-result benchmark using multiple workloads running on fixed hardware, the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. Our benchmark includes a set of workload variants that make it possible to detect benchmark submissions that are more robust to workload changes than current widely-used methods. Finally, we evaluate baseline submissions constructed using various optimizers that represent current practice, as well as other optimizers that have recently received attention in the literature. These baseline results collectively demonstrate the feasibility of our benchmark, show that non-trivial gaps between methods exist, and set a provisional state-of-the-art for future benchmark submissions to try and surpass.

Abstract: We present PAODING, a toolkit to debloat pretrained neural network models through the lens of data-free pruning. To preserve the model fidelity, PAODING adopts an iterative process, which dynamically measures the effect of deleting a neuron to identify candidates that have the least impact to the output layer. Our evaluation shows that PAODING can significantly reduce the model size, generalize on different datasets and models, and meanwhile preserve the model fidelity in terms of test accuracy and adversarial robustness. PAODING is publicly available on PyPI via https://pypi.org/project/paoding-dl.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing weights to low-precision datatypes. Since LLM inference is usually memory-bound, PTQ methods can improve inference throughput. Recent state-of-the-art PTQ approaches use vector quantization (VQ) to quantize multiple weights at once, which improves information utilization through better shaping. However, VQ requires a codebook with size exponential in the dimension. This limits current VQ-based PTQ works to low VQ dimensions ($\le 8$) that in turn limit quantization quality. Here, we introduce QTIP, which instead uses trellis coded quantization (TCQ) to achieve ultra-high-dimensional quantization. TCQ uses a stateful decoder that separates the codebook size from the bitrate and effective dimension. QTIP introduces a spectrum of lookup-only to computed lookup-free trellis codes designed for a hardware-efficient "bitshift" trellis structure; these codes achieve state-of-the-art results in both quantization quality and inference speed.

<title>Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Gradient Quantization for Federated Learning Enabled Vehicle Edge Computing</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can protect the privacy of the vehicles in vehicle edge computing (VEC) to a certain extent through sharing the gradients of vehicles' local models instead of local data. The gradients of vehicles' local models are usually large for the vehicular artificial intelligence (AI) applications, thus transmitting such large gradients would cause large per-round latency. Gradient quantization has been proposed as one effective approach to reduce the per-round latency in FL enabled VEC through compressing gradients and reducing the number of bits, i.e., the quantization level, to transmit gradients. The selection of quantization level and thresholds determines the quantization error, which further affects the model accuracy and training time. To do so, the total training time and quantization error (QE) become two key metrics for the FL enabled VEC. It is critical to jointly optimize the total training time and QE for the FL enabled VEC. However, the time-varying channel condition causes more challenges to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based quantization level allocation scheme to optimize the long-term reward in terms of the total training time and QE. Extensive simulations identify the optimal weighted factors between the total training time and QE, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for multiple applications on internet of vehicles. It requires vehicles to carry out multiple computing tasks in real time. However, due to the insufficient computing capability of vehicles themselves, offloading tasks to vehicular edge computing (VEC) servers and allocating computing resources to tasks becomes a challenge. In this paper, a multi task digital twin (DT) VEC network is established. By using DT to develop offloading strategies and resource allocation strategies for multiple tasks of each vehicle in a single slot, an optimization problem is constructed. To solve it, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method on the task offloading and resource allocation. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method is effective compared to other benchmark algorithms.

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.

Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. To date, most biosequence transformers have been trained on single-omic data-either proteins or nucleic acids and have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain, with particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in protein structural modeling. However, single-omic pre-training limits the ability of these models to capture cross-modal interactions. Here we present OmniBioTE, the largest open-source multi-omic model trained on over 250 billion tokens of mixed protein and nucleic acid data. We show that despite only being trained on unlabeled sequence data, OmniBioTE learns joint representations mapping genes to their corresponding protein sequences. We further demonstrate that OmbiBioTE achieves state-of-the-art results predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given nucleic acid and protein. Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any a priori structural training, allowing us to predict which protein residues are most involved in the protein-nucleic acid binding interaction. Lastly, compared to single-omic controls trained with identical compute, OmniBioTE demonstrates superior performance-per-FLOP across both multi-omic and single-omic benchmarks, highlighting the power of a unified modeling approach for biological sequences.

Abstract: We introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning model for multi-event survival analysis, which predicts the time until an instance experiences multiple distinct events based on its features. MENSA learns a shared representation of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structures between events. In practice, it optimizes the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that MENSA improves risk and time-to-event prediction compared to state-of-the-art models across single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event settings. Moreover, MENSA achieves this with fewer parameters and lower computational cost (FLOPs) than several deep learning baselines, particularly in high-dimensional feature spaces (more than 100 features).

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify unusual graph instances (nodes, edges, subgraphs, or graphs), has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in a wide range of applications. Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison. We further discuss multiple open problems to inspire more future high-quality research. A continuously updated repository for datasets, links to the codes of algorithms, and empirical comparison is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Anomaly-Detection.

Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this by fitting together linear pieces perfectly via the Kuhn triangulation, and we introduce a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art medical multi-modal LLMs (med-MLLMs), such as LLAVA-MED and BIOMEDGPT, primarily depend on scaling model size and data volume, with training driven largely by autoregressive objectives. However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce EXGRA-MED, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, EXGRA-MED matches LLAVA-MED's performance using just 10% of pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BIOMEDGPT and RADFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.

Abstract: We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.

<title>The Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon: Unveiling Training Loss Oscillations in Adam and Other Optimizers</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we identify and analyze a recurring training loss pattern, which we term the \textit{Epochal Sawtooth Phenomenon (ESP)}, commonly observed during training with adaptive gradient-based optimizers, particularly Adam optimizer. This pattern is characterized by a sharp drop in loss at the beginning of each epoch, followed by a gradual increase, resulting in a sawtooth-shaped loss curve. Through empirical observations, we demonstrate that while this effect is most pronounced with Adam, it persists, although less severely, with other optimizers such as RMSProp. We empirically analyze the mechanisms underlying ESP, focusing on key factors such as Adam's $\beta$ parameters, batch size, data shuffling, and sample replacement. Our analysis shows that ESP arises from adaptive learning rate adjustments controlled by the second moment estimate. Additionally, we identify the ``immediate re-exposure to samples'' effect during data shuffling, which causes the model to learn or memorize more at the beginning of each epoch. We also find that smaller values of $\beta_2$ exacerbate ESP but can act as a form of regularization. While ESP is not necessarily indicative of overfitting, higher model capacity can amplify the phenomenon. To further support our analysis, we replicate ESP through a high-dimensional quadratic minimization task. We demonstrate that ESP can emerge even in simple optimization scenarios, reinforcing the generality of this pattern. The code for reproducing our experiments is available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/training-loss-pattern.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is crucial when experiments are costly or infeasible. Additive noise models (ANMs) enable unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) identification, but existing sample-efficient ANM methods often rely on restrictive assumptions on the data generating process, limiting their applicability to real-world settings. We propose local search in additive noise models, LoSAM, a topological ordering method for learning a unique DAG in ANMs with mixed causal mechanisms and general noise distributions. We introduce new causal substructures and criteria for identifying roots and leaves, enabling efficient top-down learning. We prove asymptotic consistency and polynomial runtime, ensuring scalability and sample efficiency. We test LoSAM on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all mixed mechanism settings.

Abstract: We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series forecasting to accurately predict counts of future suspected opioid overdoses recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky. Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.

Abstract: To address communication latency issues, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined Cellular-Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) technology, which includes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication for direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, this method requires vehicles to autonomously select communication resources based on the Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) protocol, which may lead to collisions due to different vehicles sharing the same communication resources, thereby affecting communication effectiveness. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is considered a potential solution for handling large-scale vehicle communication, as it can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by employing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), thereby reducing the negative impact of communication collisions. When evaluating vehicle communication performance, traditional metrics such as reliability and transmission delay present certain contradictions. Introducing the new metric Age of Information (AoI) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of communication system. Additionally, to ensure service quality, user terminals need to possess high computational capabilities, which may lead to increased energy consumption, necessitating a trade-off between communication energy consumption and effectiveness. Given the complexity and dynamics of communication systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) serves as an intelligent learning method capable of learning optimal strategies in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of multi-priority queues and NOMA on AoI in the C-V2X vehicular communication system and proposes an energy consumption and AoI optimization method based on DRL. Finally, through comparative simulations with baseline methods, the proposed approach demonstrates its advances in terms of energy consumption and AoI.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained Models (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting still occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize lightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still comes from {\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative updates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving irrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we propose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous knowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to downstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter merging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap between different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides, to address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free self-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the model's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying the model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in the learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS

Abstract: Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a crucial tool for studying brain activity. Recently, self-supervised learning methods leveraging large unlabeled datasets have emerged as a potential solution to the scarcity of widely available annotated EEG data. However, current methods suffer from at least one of the following limitations: i) sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, ii) model sizes in the hundreds of millions of trainable parameters, and iii) reliance on private datasets and/or inconsistent public benchmarks, hindering reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a Compact Encoder for Representations of Brain Oscillations using alternating attention (CEReBrO), a new small EEG foundation model. Our tokenization scheme represents EEG signals at a per-channel patch granularity. We propose an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations, achieving 2x speed improvement with 6x less memory required compared to standard self-attention. We present several model sizes ranging from 3.6 million to 85 million parameters. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings with diverse channel configurations, our models set new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks, with competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction. This validates our models' effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and personalized graph representations.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG), where a weak model supervises a stronger one, serves as an important analogy for understanding how humans might guide superhuman intelligence in the future. Promising empirical results revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of overfitting. Our theory has significant practical implications, providing a representation-based metric that predicts W2SG performance trends without requiring labels, as shown in experiments on molecular predictions with transformers and 5 NLP tasks involving 52 LLMs.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) is a powerful framework for solving generative modeling tasks such as unpaired domain translation. Most SB-related research focuses on continuous data space $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ and leaves open theoretical and algorithmic questions about applying SB methods to discrete data, e.g, on finite spaces $\mathbb{S}^{D}$. Notable examples of such sets $\mathbb{S}$ are codebooks of vector-quantized (VQ) representations of modern autoencoders, tokens in texts, categories of atoms in molecules, etc. In this paper, we provide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for solving SB in discrete spaces using the recently introduced Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure. Specifically, we theoretically justify the convergence of discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) to SB in discrete spaces. This enables us to develop a practical computational algorithm for SB, which we call Categorical Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (CSBM). We show the performance of CSBM via a series of experiments with synthetic data and VQ representations of images. The code of CSBM is available at https://github.com/gregkseno/csbm.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning aims to develop policies that generalize to unseen tasks sampled from a task distribution. While context-based meta-RL methods improve task representation using task latents, they often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To address this, we propose Task-Aware Virtual Training (TAVT), a novel algorithm that accurately captures task characteristics for both training and OOD scenarios using metric-based representation learning. Our method successfully preserves task characteristics in virtual tasks and employs a state regularization technique to mitigate overestimation errors in state-varying environments. Numerical results demonstrate that TAVT significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks across various MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.

Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.

Abstract: The LLaMA-Adapter has recently emerged as an efficient fine-tuning technique for LLaMA models, leveraging zero-initialized attention to stabilize training and enhance performance. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of zero-initialized attention remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing a connection between zero-initialized attention and mixture-of-expert models. We prove that both linear and non-linear prompts, along with gating functions, can be optimally estimated, with non-linear prompts offering greater flexibility for future applications. Empirically, we validate our findings on the open LLM benchmarks, demonstrating that non-linear prompts outperform linear ones. Notably, even with limited training data, both prompt types consistently surpass vanilla attention, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of zero-initialized attention.

Abstract: Hu and Mehta (2024) posed an open problem: what is the optimal instance-dependent rate for the stochastic decision-theoretic online learning (with $K$ actions and $T$ rounds) under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy? Before, the best known upper bound and lower bound are $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K\log T}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and $\Omega\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K}{\varepsilon}\right)$ (where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the gap between the optimal and the second actions). In this paper, we partially address this open problem by having two new results. First, we provide an improved upper bound for this problem $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$, which is $T$-independent and only has a log dependency in $K$. Second, to further understand the gap, we introduce the \textit{deterministic setting}, a weaker setting of this open problem, where the received loss vector is deterministic. At this weaker setting, a direct application of the analysis and algorithms from the original setting still leads to an extra log factor. We conduct a novel analysis which proves upper and lower bounds that match at $\Theta(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$.

Abstract: Motivated by alternating learning dynamics in two-player games, a recent work by Cevher et al.(2024) shows that $o(\sqrt{T})$ alternating regret is possible for any $T$-round adversarial Online Linear Optimization (OLO) problem, and left as an open question whether the same is true for general Online Convex Optimization (OCO). We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the continuous Hedge algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ alternating regret for any adversarial $d$-dimensional OCO problems. We show that this implies an alternating learning dynamic that finds a Nash equilibrium for any convex-concave zero-sum games or a coarse correlated equilibrium for any convex two-player general-sum games at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{2}{3}}/T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. To further improve the time complexity and/or the dimension dependence, we propose another simple algorithm, Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with a regularizer whose convex conjugate is 3rd-order smooth, for OCO with smooth and self-concordant loss functions (such as linear or quadratic losses). We instantiate our algorithm with different regularizers and show that, for example, when the decision set is the $\ell_2$ ball, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{5}})$ alternating regret with no dimension dependence (and a better $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for quadratic losses). We complement our results by showing some algorithm-specific alternating regret lower bounds, including a somewhat surprising $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for a Regret Matching variant that is widely used in alternating learning dynamics.

Abstract: Online structured prediction is a task of sequentially predicting outputs with complex structures based on inputs and past observations, encompassing online classification. Recent studies showed that in the full-information setting, we can achieve finite bounds on the \textit{surrogate regret}, i.e. the extra target loss relative to the best possible surrogate loss. In practice, however, full-information feedback is often unrealistic as it requires immediate access to the whole structure of complex outputs. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that work with less demanding feedback, bandit and delayed feedback. For bandit feedback, by using a standard inverse-weighted gradient estimator, we achieve a surrogate regret bound of $O(\sqrt{KT})$ for the time horizon $T$ and the size of the output set $K$. However, $K$ can be extremely large when outputs are highly complex, resulting in an undesirable bound. To address this issue, we propose another algorithm that achieves a surrogate regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is independent of $K$. This is achieved with a carefully designed pseudo-inverse matrix estimator. Furthermore, we numerically compare the performance of these algorithms, as well as existing ones. Regarding delayed feedback, we provide algorithms and regret analyses that cover various scenarios, including full-information and bandit feedback, as well as fixed and variable delays.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG). Several studies have evaluated the possibility to promote SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.

Abstract: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer could be yes. Most Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. Thus, even when an LLM memorizes only a small amount of personal data, it typically falls within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching. The LLM is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded within the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.

Abstract: We study safe linear bandits (SLBs), where an agent selects actions from a convex set to maximize an unknown linear objective subject to unknown linear constraints in each round. Existing methods for SLBs provide strong regret guarantees, but require solving expensive optimization problems (e.g., second-order cones, NP hard programs). To address this, we propose Constrained Linear Thompson Sampling (COLTS), a sampling-based framework that selects actions by solving perturbed linear programs, which significantly reduces computational costs while matching the regret and risk of prior methods. We develop two main variants: S-COLTS, which ensures zero risk and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret given a safe action, and R-COLTS, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 T})$ regret and risk with no instance information. In simulations, these methods match or outperform state of the art SLB approaches while substantially improving scalability. On the technical front, we introduce a novel coupled noise design that ensures frequent `local optimism' about the true optimum, and a scaling-based analysis to handle the per-round variability of constraints.

Abstract: With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.

Abstract: Resource-efficiently computing representations of probability distributions and the distances between them while only having access to the samples is a fundamental and useful problem across mathematical sciences. In this paper, we propose a generic framework to learn the probability and cumulative distribution functions (PDFs and CDFs) of a sub-Weibull, i.e. almost any light- or heavy-tailed, distribution while the samples from it arrive in a stream. The idea is to reduce these problems into estimating the frequency of an \textit{appropriately chosen subset} of the support of a \textit{properly discretised distribution}. We leverage this reduction to compute mergeable summaries of distributions from the stream of samples while requiring only sublinear space relative to the number of observed samples. This allows us to estimate Wasserstein and Total Variation (TV) distances between any two distributions while samples arrive in streams and from multiple sources. Our algorithms significantly improves on the existing methods for distance estimation incurring super-linear time and linear space complexities, and further extend the mergeable summaries framework to continuous distributions with possibly infinite support. Our results are tight with respect to the existing lower bounds for bounded discrete distributions. In addition, we leverage our proposed estimators of Wasserstein and TV distances to tightly audit the fairness and privacy of algorithms. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of proposed algorithms across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.

Abstract: We introduce KANITE, a framework leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation under multiple treatments setting in causal inference. By utilizing KAN's unique abilities to learn univariate activation functions as opposed to learning linear weights by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we improve the estimates of ITEs. The KANITE framework comprises two key architectures: 1.Integral Probability Metric (IPM) architecture: This employs an IPM loss in a specialized manner to effectively align towards ITE estimation across multiple treatments. 2. Entropy Balancing (EB) architecture: This uses weights for samples that are learned by optimizing entropy subject to balancing the covariates across treatment groups. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KANITE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both $\epsilon_{\text{PEHE}}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ metrics. Our experiments highlight the advantages of KANITE in achieving improved causal estimates, emphasizing the potential of KANs to advance causal inference methodologies across diverse application areas.

Abstract: The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In the context of multi-agent control, the objective is to control the configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization schemes. For agents following Linear Time Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient parameterization to approximate the optimal solutions of the corresponding MFSB in closed form, without any learning step. Our proposed approach consists of a mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance Steering problem from the components of the initial mixture to the components of the terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance Steering problem, the proposed solver can handle probabilistic constraints on the system's state while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate our approach on a variety of numerical examples.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved, approaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) while benefiting from large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance Human Alignment (HA) and Reasoning. Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability. The code of this paper are released and updating on https://github.com/XueruiSu/Trust-Region-Preference-Approximation.git.

Abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.

<title>Influential Bandits: Pulling an Arm May Change the Environment</title>

Abstract: While classical formulations of multi-armed bandit problems assume that each arm's reward is independent and stationary, real-world applications often involve non-stationary environments and interdependencies between arms. In particular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a scenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or restless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit problem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric, positive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm losses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds, including a superlinear $\Omega(T^2 / \log^2 T)$ bound for the standard LCB algorithm (loss minimization version of UCB) and an algorithm-independent $\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We then introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \log T)$, which is nearly optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple to implement and computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the presence of inter-arm influence and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to conventional bandit algorithms.

Abstract: The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications demands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy frameworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential decision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal patterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics. Modern RL paradigms, such as federated RL (FedRL) and RL with human feedback (RLHF) in large language models (LLMs), exacerbate these challenges by introducing complex, interactive, and context-dependent learning environments that traditional methods do not address. In this position paper, we argue for a new privacy paradigm built on four core principles: multi-scale protection, behavioral pattern protection, collaborative privacy preservation, and context-aware adaptation. These principles expose inherent tensions between privacy, utility, and interpretability that must be navigated as RL systems become more pervasive in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems powered by LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we call for the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical mechanisms, and rigorous evaluation methodologies that collectively enable effective privacy protection in sequential decision-making systems.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example, an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated the ability to improve performance in chemistry-related tasks by selecting appropriate tools. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the inherent prediction errors of chemistry tools. In this paper, we take a step further by exploring how LLMbased agents can, in turn, be leveraged to reduce prediction errors of the tools. To this end, we propose ChemHAS (Chemical Hierarchical Agent Stacking), a simple yet effective method that enhances chemistry tools through optimizing agent-stacking structures from limited data. ChemHAS achieves state-of-the-art performance across four fundamental chemistry tasks, demonstrating that our method can effectively compensate for prediction errors of the tools. Furthermore, we identify and characterize four distinct agent-stacking behaviors, potentially improving interpretability and revealing new possibilities for AI agent applications in scientific research.

Abstract: Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning, development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization (via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size) succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the design and deployment of small language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key factor in aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional RL approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering), a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled. DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of simulating diffusion bridges, which are diffusion processes that are conditioned to initialize and terminate at two given states. The simulation of diffusion bridges has applications in diverse scientific fields and plays a crucial role in the statistical inference of discretely-observed diffusions. This is known to be a challenging problem that has received much attention in the last two decades. This article contributes to this rich body of literature by presenting a new avenue to obtain diffusion bridge approximations. Our approach is based on a backward time representation of a diffusion bridge, which may be simulated if one can time-reverse the unconditioned diffusion. We introduce a variational formulation to learn this time-reversal with function approximation and rely on a score matching method to circumvent intractability. Another iteration of our proposed methodology approximates the Doob's $h$-transform defining the forward time representation of a diffusion bridge. We discuss algorithmic considerations and extensions, and present numerical results on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, a model from financial econometrics for interest rates, and a model from genetics for cell differentiation and development to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a fundamental tool in unsupervised learning, widely used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, representation learning, and topic modeling. Many algorithms have been developed for NMF, including the well-known Multiplicative Updates (MU) algorithm, which belongs to a broader class of majorization-minimization techniques. In this work, we introduce a general second-order optimization framework for NMF under both quadratic and $\beta$-divergence loss functions. This approach, called Second-Order Majorant (SOM), constructs a local quadratic majorization of the loss function by majorizing its Hessian matrix. It includes MU as a special case, while enabling faster variants. In particular, we propose mSOM, a new algorithm within this class that leverages a tighter local approximation to accelerate convergence. We provide a convergence analysis, showing linear convergence for individual factor updates and global convergence to a stationary point for the alternating version, AmSOM algorithm. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that mSOM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across multiple loss functions.

Abstract: Many areas of science and engineering encounter data defined on spherical manifolds. Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms. Provided access to sufficiently many GPUs our transforms thus exhibit an unprecedented effective linear time complexity.

Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with $N$ samples can be linked to the $N$-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the $N$-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in $N$. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of the objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size $N$ tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative convergence rates are also obtained.

Abstract: Reducing computational scaling for simulating non-Markovian dissipative dynamics using artificial neural networks is both a major focus and formidable challenge in open quantum systems. To enable neural quantum states (NQSs), we encode environmental memory in dissipatons (quasiparticles with characteristic lifetimes), yielding the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation (DQME). The resulting NQS-DQME framework achieves compact representation of many-body correlations and non-Markovian memory. Benchmarking against numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion confirms NQS-DQME maintains comparable accuracy while enhancing scalability and interpretability. This methodology opens new paths to explore non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in previously intractable systems.

Abstract: We study submodular optimization in adversarial context, applicable to machine learning problems such as feature selection using data susceptible to uncertainties and attacks. We focus on Stackelberg games between an attacker (or interdictor) and a defender where the attacker aims to minimize the defender's objective of maximizing a $k$-submodular function. We allow uncertainties arising from the success of attacks and inherent data noise, and address challenges due to incomplete knowledge of the probability distribution of random parameters. Specifically, we introduce Distributionally Robust $k$-Submodular Interdiction Problem (DRO $k$-SIP) and Distributionally Risk-Receptive $k$-Submodular Interdiction Problem (DRR $k$-SIP) along with finitely convergent exact algorithms for solving them. When solving the DRO $k$-SIP, the attacker optimizes their expected payoff with respect to the worst-case probability distribution within the ambiguity set, and thereby have robust attack strategies despite distributional ambiguity. In contrast, the DRR $k$-SIP identifies attacker strategies with the best-case probability distribution, and identifies critical vulnerabilities for the defender. The optimal values derived from both DRO $k$-SIP and DRR $k$-SIP offer a confidence interval-like range for the expected value of the defender's objective function, capturing distributional ambiguity. We conduct computational experiments on instances of feature selection and sensor placement problems, using Wisconsin breast cancer data and synthetic data, respectively.

Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a lack of public, sizable and quality-controlled bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively referred to as MERGE, which were created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, we propose and validate fixed train-validation-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 81.74\% F1-score for bimodal classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG shows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question answering by integrating real-time domain-specific data.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for ensuring the safety of machine learning systems and has shaped the field of OOD detection. Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then, we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection. Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.

<title>DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Motion Blur Resistant Federated Self-Supervised Learning in IoV</title>

Abstract: In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by aggregating local models without sharing data. Traditional supervised learning requires image data with labels, but data labeling involves significant manual effort. Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) utilizes Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for local training in FL, eliminating the need for labels while protecting privacy. Compared to other SSL methods, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) reduces the demand for computing resources and storage space by creating a dictionary. However, using MoCo in FSSL requires uploading the local dictionary from vehicles to Base Station (BS), which poses a risk of privacy leakage. Simplified Contrast (SimCo) addresses the privacy leakage issue in MoCo-based FSSL by using dual temperature instead of a dictionary to control sample distribution. Additionally, considering the negative impact of motion blur on model aggregation, and based on SimCo, we propose a motion blur-resistant FSSL method, referred to as BFSSL. Furthermore, we address energy consumption and delay in the BFSSL process by proposing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme, called DRL-BFSSL. In this scheme, BS allocates the Central Processing Unit (CPU) frequency and transmission power of vehicles to minimize energy consumption and latency, while aggregating received models based on the motion blur level. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed aggregation and resource allocation methods.

<title>A Novel Perturb-ability Score to Mitigate Evasion Adversarial Attacks on Flow-Based ML-NIDS</title>

Abstract: As network security threats evolve, safeguarding flow-based Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from evasion adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS), which quantifies how susceptible NIDS features are to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. PS thereby identifies features structurally resistant to evasion attacks in flow-based ML-NIDS due to the semantics of network traffic fields, as these features are constrained by domain-specific limitations and correlations. Consequently, attempts to manipulate such features would likely either compromise the attack's malicious functionality, render the traffic invalid for processing, or potentially both outcomes simultaneously.
  We introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-enabled defenses, PS-guided feature selection and PS-guided feature masking, in enhancing flow-based NIDS resilience. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that discarding or masking highly manipulatable features (high-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Our findings confirm that PS effectively identifies flow-based NIDS features susceptible to problem-space perturbations. This novel approach leverages problem-space NIDS domain constraints as lightweight universal defense mechanisms against evasion adversarial attacks targeting flow-based ML-NIDS.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network can address the issue of limited computing resources and data processing capabilities of individual vehicles, but it also brings the risk of privacy leakage to vehicle users. Applying blockchain technology can establish secure data links within the IoV, solving the problems of insufficient computing resources for each vehicle and the security of data transmission over the network. However, with the development of the IoV, the amount of data interaction between multiple vehicles and between vehicles and base stations, roadside units, etc., is continuously increasing. There is a need to further reduce the interaction volume, and intelligent data compression is key to solving this problem. The VIB technique facilitates the training of encoding and decoding models, substantially diminishing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates blockchain with VIB, referred to as BVIB, designed to lighten computational workloads and reinforce the security of the network. We first construct a new network framework by separating the encoding and decoding networks to address the computational burden issue, and then propose a new algorithm to enhance the security of IoV networks. We also discuss the impact of the data extraction rate on system latency to determine the most suitable data extraction rate. An experimental framework combining Python and C++ has been established to substantiate the efficacy of our BVIB approach. Comprehensive simulation studies indicate that the BVIB consistently excels in comparison to alternative foundational methodologies.

Abstract: Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce an approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similarly to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation-a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.

arXiv:2410.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new finite expression method (FEX) to solve high-dimensional partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). This approach builds upon the original FEX and its inherent advantages with new advances: 1) A novel method of parameter grouping is proposed to reduce the number of coefficients in high-dimensional function approximation; 2) A Taylor series approximation method is implemented to significantly improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the evaluation of the integral terms of PIDEs. The new FEX based method, denoted FEX-PG to indicate the addition of the parameter grouping (PG) step to the algorithm, provides both high accuracy and interpretable numerical solutions, with the outcome being an explicit equation that facilitates intuitive understanding of the underlying solution structures. These features are often absent in traditional methods, such as finite element methods (FEM) and finite difference methods, as well as in deep learning-based approaches. To benchmark our method against recent advances, we apply the new FEX-PG to solve benchmark PIDEs in the literature. In high-dimensional settings, FEX-PG exhibits strong and robust performance, achieving relative errors on the order of single precision machine epsilon.

<title>Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think</title>

arXiv:2410.06940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.

Abstract: We introduce a novel optimal transport framework for probabilistic circuits (PCs). While it has been shown recently that divergences between distributions represented as certain classes of PCs can be computed tractably, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to compute the Wasserstein distance between probability distributions given by PCs. We propose a Wasserstein-type distance that restricts the coupling measure of the associated optimal transport problem to be a probabilistic circuit. We then develop an algorithm for computing this distance by solving a series of small linear programs and derive the circuit conditions under which this is tractable. Furthermore, we show that we can easily retrieve the optimal transport plan between the PCs from the solutions to these linear programs. Lastly, we study the empirical Wasserstein distance between a PC and a dataset, and show that we can estimate the PC parameters to minimize this distance through an efficient iterative algorithm.

arXiv:2410.17161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models lack the notion of interchangeable tokens: symbols that are semantically equivalent yet distinct, such as bound variables in formal logic. This limitation prevents generalization to larger vocabularies and hinders the model's ability to recognize alpha-equivalence, where renaming bound variables preserves meaning. We formalize this machine learning problem and introduce alpha-covariance, a metric for evaluating robustness to such transformations. To tackle this task, we propose a dual-part token embedding strategy: a shared component ensures semantic consistency, while a randomized component maintains token distinguishability. Compared to a baseline that relies on alpha-renaming for data augmentation, our approach demonstrates improved generalization to unseen tokens in linear temporal logic solving, propositional logic assignment prediction, and copying with an extendable vocabulary, while introducing a favorable inductive bias for alpha-equivalence. Our findings establish a foundation for designing language models that can learn interchangeable token representations, a crucial step toward more flexible and systematic reasoning in formal domains.

Abstract: We create two German-only decoder models, LL\"aMmlein 120M and 1B, transparently from scratch and publish them, along with the training data, for the German NLP research community to use. The model training involved several key steps, including extensive data preprocessing, the creation of a custom German tokenizer, the training itself, as well as the evaluation of the final models on various benchmarks. Throughout the training process, multiple checkpoints were saved and analyzed using the SuperGLEBer benchmark to monitor the models' learning dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art models on the SuperGLEBer benchmark, both LL\"aMmlein models performed competitively, consistently matching or surpassing models with similar parameter sizes. The results show that the models' quality scales with size as expected, but performance improvements on some tasks plateaued early, offering valuable insights into resource allocation for future model development.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.

<title>REVOLVE: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. Beyond its practical contributions, REVOLVE highlights a promising direction, where the rich knowledge from established optimization principles can be leveraged to enhance LLM systems, which paves the way for further advancements in this hybrid domain.

<title>Detecting Neurocognitive Disorders through Analyses of Topic Evolution and Cross-modal Consistency in Visual-Stimulated Narratives</title>

Abstract: Early detection of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Given that language impairments manifest early in NCD progression, visual-stimulated narrative (VSN)-based analysis offers a promising avenue for NCD detection. Current VSN-based NCD detection methods primarily focus on linguistic microstructures (e.g., pauses, lexical diversity), which are potentially linked to bottom-up (stimulus-driven) cognitive processing. While these features illuminate basic language abilities, the higher-order linguistic macrostructures (e.g., thematic or logical development), which may reflect top-down (concept-driven) cognitive abilities, remain underexplored. These patterns are crucial for NCD detection yet challenging to quantify due to their abstract and complex nature. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel dynamic macrostructural approaches: (1) Dynamic Topic Model (DTM) to track topic evolution over time, and (2) Text-Image Temporal Alignment Network (TITAN) to measure cross-modal consistency between speech and visual stimuli. Experimental results validated the efficiency of proposed approaches in NCD detection, with TITAN achieving superior performance both on the CU-MARVEL-RABBIT corpus (F1 = 0.7238) and the ADReSS corpus (F1 = 0.8889). The feature contribution analysis revealed that macrostructural features (e.g., topic variability, topic change rate, and topic consistency) constituted the most significant contributors in the model's decision pathways, outperforming investigated microstructural features. These findings underscore the critical role of macrostructural patterns in understanding cognitive impairment mechanisms in NCDs.

<title>Local minima of the empirical risk in high dimension: General theorems and convex examples</title>

Abstract: We consider a general model for high-dimensional empirical risk minimization whereby the data $\mathbf{x}_i$ are $d$-dimensional isotropic Gaussian vectors, the model is parametrized by $\mathbf{\Theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$, and the loss depends on the data via the projection $\mathbf{\Theta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{x}_i$. This setting covers as special cases classical statistics methods (e.g. multinomial regression and other generalized linear models), but also two-layer fully connected neural networks with $k$ hidden neurons. We use the Kac-Rice formula from Gaussian process theory to derive a bound on the expected number of local minima of this empirical risk, under the proportional asymptotics in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n\asymp d$. Via Markov's inequality, this bound allows to determine the positions of these minimizers (with exponential deviation bounds) and hence derive sharp asymptotics on the estimation and prediction error. In this paper, we apply our characterization to convex losses, where high-dimensional asymptotics were not (in general) rigorously established for $k\ge 2$. We show that our approach is tight and allows to prove previously conjectured results. In addition, we characterize the spectrum of the Hessian at the minimizer. A companion paper applies our general result to non-convex examples.

Abstract: Focusing on the expert problem in online learning, this paper studies the interpolation of several performance metrics via $\phi$-regret minimization, which measures the total loss of an algorithm by its regret with respect to an arbitrary action modification rule $\phi$. With $d$ experts and $T\gg d$ rounds in total, we present a single algorithm achieving the instance-adaptive $\phi$-regret bound \begin{equation*} \tilde O\left(\min\left\{\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi+1},\sqrt{d-d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi}\right\}\cdot\sqrt{T}\right), \end{equation*} where $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi$ is the maximum amount of experts modified identically by $\phi$, and $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi$ is the amount of experts that $\phi$ trivially modifies to themselves. By recovering the optimal $O(\sqrt{T\log d})$ external regret bound when $d^{\mathrm{unif}}_\phi=d$, the standard $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ internal regret bound when $d^{\mathrm{self}}_\phi=d-1$ and the optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT})$ swap regret bound in the worst case, we improve upon existing algorithms in the intermediate regimes. In addition, the computational complexity of our algorithm matches that of the standard swap-regret minimization algorithm due to (Blum and Mansour, 2007).
  Technically, building on the well-known reduction from $\phi$-regret minimization to external regret minimization on stochastic matrices, our main idea is to further convert the latter to online linear regression using Haar-wavelet-inspired matrix features. Then, by associating the complexity of each $\phi$ instance with its sparsity under the feature representation, we apply techniques from comparator-adaptive online learning to exploit the sparsity in this regression subroutine.

Abstract: The surge of explainable artificial intelligence methods seeks to enhance transparency and explainability in machine learning models. At the same time, there is a growing demand for explaining decisions taken through complex algorithms used in mathematical optimization. However, current explanation methods do not take into account the structure of the underlying optimization problem, leading to unreliable outcomes. In response to this need, we introduce Coherent Local Explanations for Mathematical Optimization (CLEMO). CLEMO provides explanations for multiple components of optimization models, the objective value and decision variables, which are coherent with the underlying model structure. Our sampling-based procedure can provide explanations for the behavior of exact and heuristic solution algorithms. The effectiveness of CLEMO is illustrated by experiments for the shortest path problem, the knapsack problem, and the vehicle routing problem.

Abstract: Searching for objects in cluttered environments requires selecting efficient viewpoints and manipulation actions to remove occlusions and reduce uncertainty in object locations, shapes, and categories. In this work, we address the problem of manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping, where a robot has to efficiently identify all objects in a cluttered shelf. Although Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes~(POMDPs) are standard for decision-making under uncertainty, representing unstructured interactive worlds remains challenging in this formalism. To tackle this, we define a POMDP whose belief is summarized by a metric-semantic grid map and propose a novel framework that uses neural networks to perform map-space belief updates to reason efficiently and simultaneously about object geometries, locations, categories, occlusions, and manipulation physics. Further, to enable accurate information gain analysis, the learned belief updates should maintain calibrated estimates of uncertainty. Therefore, we propose Calibrated Neural-Accelerated Belief Updates (CNABUs) to learn a belief propagation model that generalizes to novel scenarios and provides confidence-calibrated predictions for unknown areas. Our experiments show that our novel POMDP planner improves map completeness and accuracy over existing methods in challenging simulations and successfully transfers to real-world cluttered shelves in zero-shot fashion.

Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.

Abstract: While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method.

<title>VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.

Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring is a key tool for biodiversity conservation, but the large volumes of unsupervised audio it generates present major challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning offers promising solutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success in many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its training data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than entire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations, complicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We deployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and manually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments spanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird vocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were classified using custom models trained at the local scale. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of detector and fine-tuned BirdNET outperformed the baseline without detection. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with local classification models. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools to specific ecological challenges. Automatically detecting bird species helps track the health of this threatened ecosystem, given birds sensitivity to environmental change, and supports conservation planning to reduce biodiversity loss.

Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation has gained significant attention for its realism and broad applications, but remains prone to violations of common sense and physical laws. This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods, along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a representer theorem showing that the sparse optimization problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient, learning-inspired implementation.

Abstract: We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection. Code available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/GR00T-Dreams.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ans\"atze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.

Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds, surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local* minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new, potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).

Abstract: Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information. Our code is available at https://github.com/tiiuae/gnn-jamming-source-localization.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary within learnable distribution classes.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency. However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions, highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy, deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Summary:<br />
Language model outputs can be unreliable, leading to research on adapting responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include abstention, where models refrain from generating responses, and linguistic calibration, where models hedge statements with uncertainty quantifiers. A unified approach, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), interprets linguistic calibration as answer set prediction. By connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through linguistic pragmatics, CLC allows for controlling the imprecision in model responses. Results show that CLC produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Additionally, CLC enables fine-tuning models for uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, striking a balance between factuality and specificity.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into how to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include: \emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic calibration as \emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic pragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance between factuality and specificity.

<div> Latent matrix factorization, binarizing factors, multi-scale compensation mechanism, Dual-SVID, integrated Residual Compensation <br />
Summary: <br />
LittleBit is a novel method for extreme compression of large language models (LLMs) targeting levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31 times memory reduction. It represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization and integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism to counteract information loss. Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) enables stable quantization-aware training initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation helps mitigate errors. LittleBit outperforms leading methods in sub-1-bit quantization and shows potential for a 5 times speedup compared to FP16 in kernel-level benchmarks, paving the way for deploying powerful LLMs in resource-constrained environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) often faces challenges from substantial memory and computational costs. Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. This establishes a superior size-performance trade-off, with kernel-level benchmarks indicating potential for a 5$\times$ speedup compared to FP16. LittleBit paves the way for deploying powerful LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices can struggle with personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect responses. To address this issue, the MobiEdit framework has been developed to enable efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices. MobiEdit utilizes quantized forward-only gradient estimation instead of resource-heavy backpropagation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). Two optimizations, an early stopping mechanism and prefix cache, further enhance gradient estimation efficiency. This approach allows for real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model on mobile devices with significantly reduced memory usage, energy consumption, and latency compared to previous methods. MobiEdit represents a significant advancement in enabling effective and efficient knowledge editing on mobile devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on mobile devices to power killer applications such as intelligent assistants. LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps. Our approach enables real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) on COTS mobile devices with 7.6$\times$ less memory, 14.7 $\times$ less energy and 3.6$\times$ less latency compared to previous knowledge editing methods.

Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem relevant to manufacturing and timetabling. Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models. JobShopLib provides the necessary tools for future experimentation.

Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, leading to complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. Accurate state-level predictions are vital for effective healthcare planning and targeted interventions, but in many cases, data for necessary analyses are incomplete. This study begins with a data engineering process to integrate diabetes-related datasets from 2011 to 2021 to create a comprehensive feature set. We then introduce an enhanced bagging ensemble regression model (EBMBag+) for time series forecasting to predict diabetes prevalence across U.S. cities. Several baseline models, including SVMReg, BDTree, LSBoost, NN, LSTM, and ERMBag, were evaluated for comparison with our EBMBag+ algorithm.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid meta-learning framework for forecasting and anomaly detection in nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by nonstationary and stochastic behavior. The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.

Summary: 
Concept-based approaches are important for interpreting embeddings from deep neural networks like CLIP, but current methods lack statistical rigor. To address this, a new hypothesis testing framework is introduced to quantify rotation-sensitive structures in the CLIP embedding space. A post-hoc concept decomposition method is proposed to identify robust and reproducible patterns, outperforming existing techniques in reconstruction error. Empirical results show that the algorithm balances reconstruction accuracy and concept interpretability, reducing spurious cues in data. When applied to a spurious correlation dataset, the method improves worst-group accuracy by 22.6% after eliminating spurious background concepts. The work provides a more reliable and effective approach to understanding and interpreting concepts within deep neural network models, offering theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: Concept-based approaches, which aim to identify human-understandable concepts within a model's internal representations, are a promising method for interpreting embeddings from deep neural network models, such as CLIP. While these approaches help explain model behavior, current methods lack statistical rigor, making it challenging to validate identified concepts and compare different techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework that quantifies rotation-sensitive structures within the CLIP embedding space. Once such structures are identified, we propose a post-hoc concept decomposition method. Unlike existing approaches, it offers theoretical guarantees that discovered concepts represent robust, reproducible patterns (rather than method-specific artifacts) and outperforms other techniques in terms of reconstruction error. Empirically, we demonstrate that our concept-based decomposition algorithm effectively balances reconstruction accuracy with concept interpretability and helps mitigate spurious cues in data. Applied to a popular spurious correlation dataset, our method yields a 22.6% increase in worst-group accuracy after removing spurious background concepts.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolvable conditional diffusion method such that black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics models, as are common in domains like computational fluid dynamics and electromagnetics, can be effectively used for guiding the generative process to facilitate autonomous scientific discovery. We formulate the guidance as an optimization problem where one optimizes for a desired fitness function through updates to the descriptive statistic for the denoising distribution, and derive an evolution-guided approach from first principles through the lens of probabilistic evolution. Interestingly, the final derived update algorithm is analogous to the update as per common gradient-based guided diffusion models, but without ever having to compute any derivatives. We validate our proposed evolvable diffusion algorithm in two AI for Science scenarios: the automated design of fluidic topology and meta-surface. Results demonstrate that this method effectively generates designs that better satisfy specific optimization objectives without reliance on differentiable proxies, providing an effective means of guidance-based diffusion that can capitalize on the wealth of black-box, non-differentiable multi-physics numerical models common across Science.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces T-REX, a simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. It models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' behaviors, such as rerouting and speed adaptation, to simulate congestion propagation under incidents. The study proposes a suite of metrics to assess the robustness of RL-TSC methods. Experiments across synthetic and real-world networks show that independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods converge quickly but struggle under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods offer stable performance in large, irregular networks but with slower convergence and higher complexity. The findings emphasize the importance of robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX provides an open, standardized platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.<br /> 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.

<div> retraining, machine learning, energy consumption, sustainability, data change detection
Summary: 
Retraining for machine learning systems is crucial for maintaining reliability in the face of changing data, but it can be energy-intensive. This study compares common retraining techniques in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy. The results show that retraining with only the most recent data, as opposed to all available data, can reduce energy consumption by up to 25%, offering a sustainable alternative. Additionally, retraining a model only when necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can further decrease energy consumption by up to 40% with the use of a reliable data change detector. These findings provide valuable insights for ML practitioners, suggesting more energy-efficient retraining techniques for designing sustainable ML software systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The reliability of machine learning (ML) software systems is heavily influenced by changes in data over time. For that reason, ML systems require regular maintenance, typically based on model retraining. However, retraining requires significant computational demand, which makes it energy-intensive and raises concerns about its environmental impact. To understand which retraining techniques should be considered when designing sustainable ML applications, in this work, we study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques. Since the accuracy of ML systems is also essential, we compare retraining techniques in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy. We showcase that retraining with only the most recent data, compared to all available data, reduces energy consumption by up to 25\%, being a sustainable alternative to the status quo. Furthermore, our findings show that retraining a model only when there is evidence that updates are necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can reduce energy consumption by up to 40\%, provided a reliable data change detector is in place. Our findings pave the way for better recommendations for ML practitioners, guiding them toward more energy-efficient retraining techniques when designing sustainable ML software systems.

Summary:
Living environments significantly impact disease prevalence and progression, highlighting the need for AI models to incorporate environmental data. The lack of long-term and fine-grained spatial and temporal data in public health studies hinders model performance. SatHealth dataset addresses this gap by combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, disease prevalences, and social determinants of health indicators. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating living environmental information in AI models for regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. A web-based application provides access to the dataset and regional environmental embedding for easy utilization. SatHealth is currently available for Ohio, with plans to expand coverage across the US. This work sets the foundation for future research in environmental health informatics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Living environments play a vital role in the prevalence and progression of diseases, and understanding their impact on patient's health status becomes increasingly crucial for developing AI models. However, due to the lack of long-term and fine-grained spatial and temporal data in public and population health studies, most existing studies fail to incorporate environmental data, limiting the models' performance and real-world application. To address this shortage, we developed SatHealth, a novel dataset combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, all-disease prevalences estimated from medical claims, and social determinants of health (SDoH) indicators. We conducted experiments under two use cases with SatHealth: regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. Experimental results show that living environmental information can significantly improve AI models' performance and temporal-spatial generalizability on various tasks. Finally, we deploy a web-based application to provide an exploration tool for SatHealth and one-click access to both our data and regional environmental embedding to facilitate plug-and-play utilization. SatHealth is now published with data in Ohio, and we will keep updating SatHealth to cover the other parts of the US. With the web application and published code pipeline, our work provides valuable angles and resources to include environmental data in healthcare research and establishes a foundational framework for future research in environmental health informatics.

<div> keywords: Reinforcement Learning, regularization, Policy Mirror Descent, deep RL algorithms, StaQ

Summary:
In the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization techniques have become popular for improving exploration, robustness, and stability in algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) addresses the regularized policy optimization problem theoretically but practical implementation is hindered by the computational complexity of past Q-functions. A new algorithm called StaQ is proposed, based on PMD principles, that only retains the last $M$ Q-functions in memory for a convergent solution. This approach eliminates errors in policy updates seen in previous deep RL PMD implementations and shows improved performance stability compared to existing algorithms. StaQ offers strong theoretical guarantees and proves to be competitive with deep RL baselines, opening avenues for more stable deep RL algorithms and serving as a platform for further Policy Mirror Descent experimentation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), regularization has emerged as a popular tool both in theory and practice, typically based either on an entropy bonus or a Kullback-Leibler divergence that constrains successive policies. In practice, these approaches have been shown to improve exploration, robustness and stability, giving rise to popular Deep RL algorithms such as SAC and TRPO. Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a theoretical framework that solves this general regularized policy optimization problem, however the closed-form solution involves the sum of all past Q-functions, which is intractable in practice. We propose and analyze PMD-like algorithms that only keep the last $M$ Q-functions in memory, and show that for finite and large enough $M$, a convergent algorithm can be derived, introducing no error in the policy update, unlike prior deep RL PMD implementations. StaQ, the resulting algorithm, enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and is competitive with deep RL baselines, while exhibiting less performance oscillation, paving the way for fully stable deep RL algorithms and providing a testbed for experimentation with Policy Mirror Descent.

Summary:
The study introduces Algorithm Distillation (AD) for In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) using a causal transformer model. However, practical limitations hindered its application in complex environments with long time horizons. To address this, the researchers propose using Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, known for their linear scalability in sequence length and state-of-the-art performance in sequence modeling. Through experiments in Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, a model called Mamba, built with S6 layers, outperformed the transformer model for AD. Scaling AD to longer contexts proved beneficial, enhancing ICRL performance and enabling competitiveness with a leading online meta RL baseline. This signifies the potential of S6 models in improving AD for ICRL tasks in challenging settings. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm Distillation (AD) was recently proposed as a new approach to perform In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) by modeling across-episodic training histories autoregressively with a causal transformer model. However, due to practical limitations induced by the attention mechanism, experiments were bottlenecked by the transformer's quadratic complexity and limited to simple discrete environments with short time horizons. In this work, we propose leveraging the recently proposed Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, which achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-range sequence modeling while scaling linearly in sequence length. Through four complex and continuous Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, we demonstrate the overall superiority of Mamba, a model built with S6 layers, over a transformer model for AD. Additionally, we show that scaling AD to very long contexts can improve ICRL performance and make it competitive even with a SOTA online meta RL baseline.

<div> Keywords: rule-based systems, feature contributions, interpretability, clinical datasets, diagnostic accuracy

Summary:
In domains like healthcare, interpretability and trust are essential, leading to the preference for rule-based systems over black-box models for decision support. However, as rule-based models become more complex, understanding feature importance and comparing contributions across different rule sets presents challenges. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems. It includes a graph-based feature visualization strategy, a novel feature importance metric independent of rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. Through experiments on clinical datasets and various rule-based methods, such as decision trees and neural networks, the framework uncovers new insights into the combined predictive value of clinical features at both dataset and class-specific levels. This method can help identify new risk factors, signature genes, potential biomarkers, and enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks shows competitive performance and superior robustness. The implementation of the method is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: In domains where transparency and trustworthiness are crucial, such as healthcare, rule-based systems are widely used and often preferred over black-box models for decision support systems due to their inherent interpretability. However, as rule-based models grow complex, discerning crucial features, understanding their interactions, and comparing feature contributions across different rule sets becomes challenging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems, introducing a graph-based feature visualisation strategy, a novel feature importance metric agnostic to rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. By experimenting on two clinical datasets and four rule-based methods (decision trees, logic learning machines, association rules, and neural networks with rule extraction), we showcase our method's capability to uncover novel insights on the combined predictive value of clinical features, both at the dataset and class-specific levels. These insights can aid in identifying new risk factors, signature genes, and potential biomarkers, and determining the subset of patient information that should be prioritised to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparative analysis of the proposed feature importance score with state-of-the-art methods on 15 public benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance and superior robustness. The method implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ChristelSirocchi/rule-graph.

<br />
Summary:<br />
A novel graph-informed transformer operator (GITO) architecture is proposed for learning complex partial differential equation systems on irregular geometries and non-uniform meshes. The GITO consists of two modules: a hybrid graph transformer (HGT) and a transformer neural operator (TNO). The HGT combines a graph neural network (GNN) and a transformer to capture local spatial relationships and long-range dependencies. A self-attention fusion layer integrates the outputs of the GNN and transformer for more expressive feature learning on graph-structured data. The TNO module utilizes cross-attention and self-attention layers for mapping input functions to predictions at arbitrary query locations, ensuring discretization invariance and enabling zero-shot super-resolution across any mesh. Empirical results show that GITO outperforms existing transformer-based neural operators, promising efficient, mesh-agnostic surrogate solvers for engineering applications. <br /> <div>

Summary:
In this study, the application of few-shot learning (FSL) to industrial time-series data for screw-fastening process monitoring was explored. A new label-aware episodic sampler was introduced to handle multi-label sequences efficiently. Two FSL paradigms, Prototypical Network and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), were tested with different network backbones. The results showed that the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieved high accuracy in both multi-class and multi-label regimes, outperforming a larger transformer model. Metric learning consistently outperformed MAML across all backbones, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight CNN architectures in scenarios with limited data. The findings challenge the belief that larger models are always superior and highlight the importance of efficient training methods for industrial applications. A code, data splits, and pre-trained weights are provided to facilitate reproducible research and promote the adoption of FSL in manufacturing inspection.

<br /><br />Summary: 
This study explores few-shot learning in industrial time-series data for screw-fastening process monitoring, introducing a label-aware sampler and testing different FSL approaches and network backbones. Results show the effectiveness of metric learning over traditional MAML, with lightweight CNN architectures outperforming larger models in scenarios with limited data. The findings challenge the notion that bigger models are always better and emphasize the importance of efficient training methods in industrial applications. The code, data splits, and pre-trained weights are made available for reproducible research and to encourage the adoption of FSL in manufacturing inspection. <div>
arXiv:2506.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information.
  Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling.
  These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better. We release code, data splits and pre-trained weights to foster reproducible research and to catalyze the adoption of FSL in high-value manufacturing inspection.

The paper introduces Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), a novel extension of GNNs that incorporates hierarchical node individualization inspired by the Individualization-Refinement concept for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and create a hierarchy of models that can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. The study provides a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers using graded hybrid logic, linking the separating power of HEGNNs to higher-order GNNs, local homomorphism count feature-enriched GNNs, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of HEGNNs and their advantages over traditional GNN architectures, with or without local homomorphism count features. <div>

Abstract: We propose and study Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), an expressive extension of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical node individualization, inspired by the Individualization-Refinement paradigm for graph isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, can distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We provide a logical characterization of HEGNN node classifiers, with and without subgraph restrictions, using graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, capability gain, self-distillation, natural language guidance, online training algorithms 

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn to solve new problems by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and through capability gain, where they can solve new problems they previously could not. The learning process is primarily driven by self-distillation across model scales. By incorporating natural language guidance, models can improve pass@$k$ rates while deriving solutions from scratch. The article introduces $\text{Guide}$, a new class of online training algorithms that adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on difficult problems. Variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO show improved generalization on math benchmarks for large parameter models. Ablations and theoretical analyses are included to understand $\text{Guide}$'s components and learning efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically analyze Guide's learning efficiency.

Summary:
ReinDSplit introduces a new framework for precision agriculture utilizing distributed machine learning. It addresses the limitations of conventional split learning by employing reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize DNN split points for individual devices. This allows for more efficient resource utilization and improved model performance. The framework utilizes a Q-learning agent to balance workloads and latency thresholds across devices, ensuring that even highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training. Evaluated on insect classification datasets, ReinDSplit achieves high accuracy with MobileNetV2. This innovative approach not only benefits agriculture but also advances the field of split learning by leveraging reinforcement learning for enhanced resource efficiency, privacy preservation, and scalability in heterogeneous environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To empower precision agriculture through distributed machine learning (DML), split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and servers to reduce computational burdens and preserve data privacy. However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2. Beyond agriculture, ReinDSplit pioneers a paradigm shift in SL by harmonizing RL for resource efficiency, privacy, and scalability in heterogeneous environments.

arXiv:2506.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment, auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.

<div> heterogeneous objectives, Local Gradient Descent, logistic regression, communication rounds, convergence rate<br />
Summary:<br />
The study examines Local Gradient Descent for logistic regression with separable, heterogeneous data, allowing any stepsize $\eta > 0$. It demonstrates convergence at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\eta K R)$ after an initial unstable phase of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\eta K M)$ rounds. Unlike previous analyses that required $\eta \leq 1/K$ for monotonic decrease, this work shows improvement with any $\eta > 0. The research aligns with prior work on single-machine analysis, attributing instability to large stepsizes and heterogeneous objectives leading to significant local updates. This advancement contrasts the existing $\mathcal{O}(1/R)$ convergence rate for general smooth, convex objectives. <div>

Abstract: Existing analysis of Local (Stochastic) Gradient Descent for heterogeneous objectives requires stepsizes $\eta \leq 1/K$ where $K$ is the communication interval, which ensures monotonic decrease of the objective. In contrast, we analyze Local Gradient Descent for logistic regression with separable, heterogeneous data using any stepsize $\eta > 0$. With $R$ communication rounds and $M$ clients, we show convergence at a rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\eta K R)$ after an initial unstable phase lasting for $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\eta K M)$ rounds. This improves upon the existing $\mathcal{O}(1/R)$ rate for general smooth, convex objectives. Our analysis parallels the single machine analysis of~\cite{wu2024large} in which instability is caused by extremely large stepsizes, but in our setting another source of instability is large local updates with heterogeneous objectives.

<div> Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning, Imbalanced Data, Expert Systems, Feature Interactions, Mixup Strategy <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces QCL-MixNet, a novel framework for handling imbalanced tabular data in expert systems. It addresses challenges such as overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions by incorporating a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer, a sample-aware mixup strategy, and a hybrid loss function. The framework outperforms 20 state-of-the-art baselines in macro-F1 and recall on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each architectural component. The results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for handling imbalance in expert systems. Theoretical analyses support its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness. <div>
arXiv:2506.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.

Summary:  
- Large language models (LLMs) are used in data science workflows but struggle to leverage domain knowledge effectively.  
- AssistedDS benchmark evaluates LLMs in tabular prediction tasks with synthetic and real-world datasets.  
- LLMs tend to blindly adopt provided information, leading to decreased predictive performance in the presence of adversarial content.  
- Helpful guidance is inadequate in mitigating the negative impact of adversarial information on LLMs.  
- LLMs show errors in handling time-series data, consistent feature engineering, and interpreting categorical variables in Kaggle datasets.  
- Current models lack the ability to critically evaluate and utilize expert knowledge, emphasizing the need to develop more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

Arctic Long Sequence Training (ALST) addresses the challenge of training long sequences in AI models by providing optimizations for single GPU and multi-GPU memory utilization. This allows for out-of-the-box training of multi-million sequence lengths for a variety of models, including Meta's Llama 8B model. ALST supports sequence lengths of 500K on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on a single 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster. This represents a significant increase compared to the 32K baseline previously achieved. ALST is fully compatible with Hugging Face models and is open-sourced through Deepspeed and Arctic Training platforms. By leveraging attention-agnostic optimizations, ALST enables more efficient and accessible long sequence training for applications such as RAG, document summarization, and multi-modality.

ALST supports sequence lengths of 500K on a single GPU, 3.7M on an 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster, a significant improvement over the 32K baseline.

arXiv:2506.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long sequences are critical for applications like RAG, long document summarization, multi-modality, etc., and modern LLMs, like Llama 4 Scout, support max sequence length of up to 10 million tokens. However, outside of enterprise labs, long sequence training is challenging for the AI community with limited system support in the open-source space.
  Out-of-box, even on a modern NVIDIA H100 80GB GPU cluster, training Llama 8B model with sequence over 32K runs out of memory on a basic Hugging Face (HF) model due to two reasons: i) LLM training workloads are not optimized to fully leverage a single GPU memory, ii) existing solutions for leveraging multiple GPU memory are not easily available to HF models, making long sequence training inaccessible.
  We address this with Arctic Long Sequence Training (ALST). It offers a combination of attention-agnostic single GPU and multi-GPU memory optimizations, that enables it to support out-of-box training of multi-million sequence length for a wide variety of HF models.
  ALST supports training Meta's Llama 8B model with 500K sequence length on a single H100 GPU, 3.7M on a single 8xH100 GPU node, and over 15M on a 4 node cluster, an increase of over 400x compared to the 32K baseline for the latter.

A new statistical framework is proposed, defining feature identifiability and modeling polysemantic features as mixtures of underlying concepts. A novel SAE training algorithm based on bias adaptation is introduced, with theoretical proof of correct monosemantic feature recovery.

Abstract: We study the challenge of achieving theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for the interpretation of Large Language Models. Existing SAE training algorithms often lack rigorous mathematical guarantees and suffer from practical limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and instability. To address these issues, we first propose a novel statistical framework for the feature recovery problem, which includes a new notion of feature identifiability by modeling polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of underlying monosemantic concepts. Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity. We theoretically \highlight{prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features} when input data is sampled from our proposed statistical model. Furthermore, we develop an improved empirical variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), and \highlight{demonstrate its superior performance against benchmark methods when applied to LLMs with up to 1.5 billion parameters}. This work represents a foundational step in demystifying SAE training by providing the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, thereby advancing the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI systems through enhanced mechanistic interpretability.

<div> Machine unlearning, large language models, LLM unlearning, data privacy, copyright protection

Summary: 
Machine unlearning (MU) in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specific undesirable data while maintaining performance. However, a new vulnerability post-unlearning is identified: unlearning trace detection. This leaves detectable "fingerprints" in LLMs, visible in model behavior and internal representations. Traces can be identified in output responses, even with forget-irrelevant inputs, through a simple supervised classifier. Analysis shows these traces are present in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer. Forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in trace detection across all model sizes. Large LLMs still have high detectability even with forget-irrelevant inputs, posing a risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information if a model is identified as unlearned. This study sheds light on the measurable signatures left by unlearning, posing a new risk in the field of machine unlearning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

Summary:
Graph generation is crucial in various fields like drug discovery. Current methods like diffusion and flow-based models construct a probability path linearly, assuming data lie in Euclidean space. This approach overlooks the non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, potentially impacting sampling convergence. To address this limitation, a novel framework called BWFlow is introduced. BWFlow models the joint evolution of nodes and edges using Markov random fields and leverages optimal transport displacement to design a probability path for graph generation. The framework respects the underlying geometry of graphs, providing smooth velocities in the path. Experimental evaluations confirm BWFlow's effectiveness in graph generation, demonstrating competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a critical task in fields ranging from molecule design to drug discovery. Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) to accurately estimate spatially varying elasticity parameters such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio from noisy displacement measurements. The network consists of three separate architectures for modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, enhancing stability and accuracy in the presence of noise. A two-phase estimation approach is utilized to recover relative elasticity distributions in the first phase and calibrate the absolute Young's modulus in the second phase. Methodological innovations including positional encoding and sine activation functions improve model performance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate IE-PINN's ability to provide accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even in the presence of severe noise, highlighting its potential for applications in clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurately estimating spatially heterogeneous elasticity parameters, particularly Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, from noisy displacement measurements remains significantly challenging in inverse elasticity problems. Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability, pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise. Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using imposed loading boundary conditions. Additional methodological innovations, including positional encoding, sine activation functions, and a sequential pretraining protocol, further enhance the model's performance and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that IE-PINN effectively overcomes critical limitations encountered by existing methods, delivering accurate absolute-scale elasticity estimations even under severe noise conditions. This advancement holds substantial potential for clinical imaging diagnostics and mechanical characterization, where measurements typically encounter substantial noise.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel load balancing mechanism for Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to enhance training efficiency. These models efficiently activate only a subset of parameters for each input, but without balancing mechanisms, routers may converge to using only a few experts, limiting model capacity. The proposed load balancing loss preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Experimental results show that incorporating this loss leads to 36% faster convergence and reduced redundancy compared to existing load balancing approaches. This improvement allows the model to better utilize its capacity and avoid learning redundant knowledge.  <div>
arXiv:2506.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models offer a scalable and efficient architecture for training large neural networks by activating only a subset of parameters ("experts") for each input. A learned router computes a distribution over these experts, and assigns input tokens to a small subset. However, without auxiliary balancing mechanisms, routers often converge to using only a few experts, severely limiting model capacity and degrading performance. Most current load balancing mechanisms encourage a distribution over experts that resembles a roughly uniform distribution of experts per token. During training, this can result in inconsistent routing behavior, resulting in the model spending its capacity to learn redundant knowledge. We address this by introducing a novel load balancing loss that preserves token-wise relational structure, encouraging consistent expert choices for similar inputs during training. Our experimental results show that applying our loss to the router results in 36% faster convergence and lower redundancy compared to a popular load balancing loss.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called ScIReN that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning to enhance scientific discovery. Traditional neural networks lack transparency and do not adhere to known scientific laws, limiting their ability to provide scientific insights. Process-based models, while rooted in scientific principles, often require setting multiple parameters in an ad-hoc manner, leading to poor predictions across different scales. ScIReN addresses this issue by using an interpretable encoder to predict scientifically meaningful parameters and a process-based decoder to generate output variables. The framework also incorporates a hard-sigmoid constraint layer to ensure that latent parameters align with scientific priors. By embedding process-based models in ScIReN, researchers can uncover new scientific mechanisms hidden within black-box models while improving predictive accuracy. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of ScIReN in simulating organic carbon flow in soils and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. <div>
arXiv:2506.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are a powerful tool for learning patterns from data. However, they do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific insights due to their black-box nature. In contrast, scientific reasoning distills biological or physical principles from observations and controlled experiments, and quantitatively interprets them with process-based models made of mathematical equations. Yet, process-based models rely on numerous free parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and thus often fit observations poorly in cross-scale predictions. While prior work has embedded process-based models in conventional neural networks, discovering interpretable relationships between parameters in process-based models and input features is still a grand challenge for scientific discovery. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge, further enhancing its interpretability. While the embedded process-based model enforces established scientific knowledge, the encoder reveals new scientific mechanisms and relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

<div> Keywords: language generative models, selective generation, online learning algorithm, partial feedback, false discovery rate

Summary:
This article introduces a new approach to address the issue of falsified responses by large language generative models, known as selective generation. By selectively abstaining from answering when unsure, generators can control hallucination effects. The proposed online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback leverages concepts from multi-armed bandit problems to provide a framework for learning in non-stochastic environments. A novel conversion lemma connects bandit algorithms to selective generation, allowing for regret guarantees to be linked to false discovery rate guarantees. The algorithm exploits the unique structure of selective generation for efficient feedback unlocking, leading to better convergence speed in practice. The efficacy of the algorithm is evaluated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its ability to control false discovery rate while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency compared to baselines.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language generative models increasingly interact with humans, while their falsified responses raise concerns. To address this hallucination effect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation, provides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when it is unsure of their answers. However, as selective generators are interacting under non-stochastic environments and having partial feedback from users on selective generation (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods for selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently missing. To address these limitations, we propose an online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback. In particular, as learning under partial feedback is well-studied by multi-armed bandit problems, we reduce selective generation to bandits and provide a novel conversion lemma from bandits back to selective generation to leverage any known bandit algorithms and theoretical properties. This mainly connects regret guarantees of bandits to false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees of selective generation for controlling hallucination. However, naively exploiting known bandit algorithms and their regret bounds suffers from slow convergence speed in practice due the nature of partial feedback. To overcome this, we exploit a unique structure of arms in selective generation for feedback unlocking, i.e., unlocking unknown feedback from observed feedback. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm under partial feedback over diverse data environment setups, resulting in controlling a desired FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the ratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.

Abstract: We present the Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems (CVDP) benchmark, a new dataset and infrastructure to advance LLM and agent research in hardware design and verification. CVDP includes 783 problems across 13 task categories, covering RTL generation, verification, debugging, specification alignment, and technical Q&amp;A authored by experienced hardware engineers. Problems are offered in both non-agentic and agentic formats. The benchmark introduces more realistic and challenging contexts than prior work, with state-of-the-art models achieving no more than 34% pass@1 on code generation. Agentic tasks$\unicode{x2013}$especially those involving RTL reuse and verification$\unicode{x2013}$are particularly difficult. Evaluation uses open-source tools and model scoring infrastructure, with comprehension tasks assessed via BLEU and LLM-based judging. CVDP reveals substantial gaps in current model capabilities, underscoring the need for continued research toward robust, real-world hardware design automation.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of effectively finetuning Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for specific downstream tasks. Naive finetuning methods often lead to overfitting and suboptimal performance due to the diverse temporal patterns and multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs. The authors propose MultiScale FineTuning (MSFT), a framework that integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process for encoder-based TSFMs. Experimental results on different backbones show that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT outperform naive and typical finetuning methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep learning methods. <div>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance for time series forecasting. However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

<div> sparse attention, transformers, learnability, generalization, input-dependent

Summary:
Various forms of sparse attention have been explored in transformers to address computational costs. Input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models. Input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide similar benefits. Concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with input-dependent sparse attention accelerates learning. Theoretical characterizations reveal the connection between softmax stability, Lipschitz properties of the loss function, and the impact of sparsity on attention mechanism stability. Input-agnostic sparse attention does not offer advantages, while input-dependent sparse attention can improve guarantees under certain conditions, which were validated in empirical evaluations. This study highlights the importance of considering learnability and generalization in the design of sparse attention mechanisms in transformers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various forms of sparse attention have been explored to mitigate the quadratic computational and memory cost of the attention mechanism in transformers. We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's "semantic focus" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide any benefits. We also characterize conditions when semantic focus (input-dependent sparse attention) can provide improved guarantees, and we validate that these conditions are in fact met in our empirical evaluations.

Summary: 
A new approach is proposed for building a graph foundation model pre-trained using diverse graph datasets and adapted with a Transformer backbone. The challenge lies in how a sequence model can encode graphs of different sizes and domains. Nodes are represented as multiple random walks, allowing the Transformer to extract node, edge, and graph representations. A context prediction loss for random walks is introduced, with a theoretical analysis of their ability to distinguish neighborhoods and graphs. The model is pre-trained and shown to be effective in downstream tasks, paving the way for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data. <div>
arXiv:2506.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A foundation model like GPT elicits many emergent abilities, owing to the pre-training with broad inclusion of data and the use of the powerful Transformer architecture. While foundation models in natural languages are prevalent, can we build similar models for graphs? This paper describes an approach toward a graph foundation model that is pre-trained with diverse graph datasets by adapting the Transformer backbone. A central challenge toward this end is how a sequence model encodes graphs of varying sizes and from different domains. We propose representing a node as multiple random walks, such that the Transformer can extract node representations from sequences, which in turn form edge and graph representations. We develop a novel context prediction loss for these random walks and theoretically analyze their expressive power in distinguishing neighborhoods and graphs. We also demonstrate the pre-training of our model and its adaptation to downstream tasks, showcasing its potential as a foundation for processing and reasoning with graph-structured data.

Summary:<br />
This research explores the connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By incorporating lagged observations into the state, the study establishes equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. The SKOLR model proposed integrates learnable input signal spectral decomposition with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for measurement functions, implementing a structured Koopman operator through a parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems demonstrate the superior performance of this design, based on streamlined Koopman theory principles. <div>
arXiv:2506.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory provides a framework for nonlinear dynamical system analysis and time-series forecasting by mapping dynamics to a space of real-valued measurement functions, enabling a linear operator representation. Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on various forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems show that this streamlined, Koopman-theory-based design delivers exceptional performance.

Summary:
Hybrid loss functions outperform single loss functions in GNNs, showcasing the benefits of multi-objective optimization. The GIN architecture consistently shows the highest average performance, particularly with Cross-Entropy loss. Despite overall lower average ranks, models like GAT exhibit specialized strengths when paired with specific hybrid losses, excelling in certain task demands. In contrast, the MPNN architecture often falls short in comparison. The in-depth study highlights the importance of selecting the right combination of model architecture and loss function for optimal performance on non-Euclidean data tasks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) became useful for learning on non-Euclidean data. However, their best performance depends on choosing the right model architecture and the training objective, also called the loss function. Researchers have studied these parts separately, but a large-scale evaluation has not looked at how GNN models and many loss functions work together across different tasks. To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven well-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus mixed loss functions. The study looked at both inductive and transductive settings. Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing performance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive evaluation metrics. From these extensive results (detailed in supplementary information 1 \& 2), we meticulously analyzed the top ten model-loss combinations for each metric based on their average rank. Our findings reveal that, especially for the inductive case: 1) Hybrid loss functions generally yield superior and more robust performance compared to single loss functions, indicating the benefit of multi-objective optimization. 2) The GIN architecture always showed the highest-level average performance, especially with Cross-Entropy loss. 3) Although some combinations had overall lower average ranks, models such as GAT, particularly with certain hybrid losses, demonstrated incredible specialized strengths, maximizing the most top-1 results among the individual metrics, emphasizing subtle strengths for particular task demands. 4) On the other hand, the MPNN architecture typically lagged behind the scenarios it was tested against.

<div> contrastive learning, temporal betweenness centrality, graph neural network, class imbalance, efficient prediction

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach, CLGNN, for accurate and efficient prediction of Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) in temporal networks. Existing methods struggle with imbalance and computational cost, leading to inaccurate predictions. CLGNN addresses these challenges by utilizing contrastive learning to handle class imbalance and introducing dual aggregation mechanisms for encoding structural and temporal features. The model also incorporates a stability-based clustering-guided module to separate nodes based on centrality in representation space. Additionally, CLGNN supports multiple optimal path definitions to capture diverse temporal semantics. Experimental results show that CLGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving significant speedups and higher correlation values. This approach demonstrates the potential for effectively predicting TBC in real-world temporal networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Betweenness Centrality (TBC) measures how often a node appears on optimal temporal paths, reflecting its importance in temporal networks. However, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC distributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads learning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in inaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes. Existing graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such imbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues, we propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for accurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to preserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal features using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head attention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A stability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is introduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in representation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module (ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path definitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse benchmarks. CLGNN achieves up to a 663.7~$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art exact TBC computation methods. It outperforms leading static GNN baselines with up to 31.4~$\times$ lower MAE and 16.7~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation, and surpasses state-of-the-art temporal GNNs with up to 5.7~$\times$ lower MAE and 3.9~$\times$ higher Spearman correlation.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, fine-tuning, model upcycling, transfer learning, early stopping

Summary:
In the field of modern deep learning, the use of open-weight foundation models that can be fine-tuned on specific datasets has become prevalent. This has led to the development of expert models and adapters shared on platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. Model upcycling methods have emerged, allowing for the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. However, a study challenges the assumption that improvements in pre-training and fine-tuning stages propagate downstream. It was found that long fine-tuning of experts focusing on individual performance can lead to degradation in merging performance and downstream results when upcycled into more general systems. This degradation is attributed to the memorization of difficult examples during late fine-tuning steps. The study suggests that an early stopping strategy tailored to specific tasks can significantly enhance upcycling performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep learning is increasingly characterized by the use of open-weight foundation models that can be fine-tuned on specialized datasets. This has led to a proliferation of expert models and adapters, often shared via platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. To leverage these resources, numerous model upcycling methods have emerged, enabling the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. A natural pipeline has thus formed to harness the benefits of transfer learning and amortize sunk training costs: models are pre-trained on general data, fine-tuned on specific tasks, and then upcycled into more general-purpose systems. A prevailing assumption is that improvements at one stage of this pipeline propagate downstream, leading to gains at subsequent steps. In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert fine-tuning affects model upcycling. We show that long fine-tuning of experts that optimizes for their individual performance leads to degraded merging performance, both for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and to worse downstream results when LoRA adapters are upcycled into MoE layers. We trace this degradation to the memorization of a small set of difficult examples that dominate late fine-tuning steps and are subsequently forgotten during merging. Finally, we demonstrate that a task-dependent aggressive early stopping strategy can significantly improve upcycling performance.

<div> representation, decision trees, predictive equivalence, variable importance, missing values

Summary:
The article discusses the challenge of predictive equivalence in decision trees, where different trees can have the same decision boundary but different evaluation processes. The authors propose a boolean logical representation of decision trees that eliminates this issue and accurately represents the underlying decision boundary. They demonstrate the robustness of decision trees to missing feature values at test time using this representation. The impact of predictive equivalence on quantifying variable importance is also addressed, highlighting the need for a more accurate approach. Additionally, an algorithm is presented to optimize the cost of reaching predictions, providing a more efficient method for decision tree optimization. Overall, the new representation offers a solution to the predictive equivalence problem and improves the interpretation and performance of decision trees in various machine learning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely used for interpretable machine learning due to their clearly structured reasoning process. However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.

<div> Keywords: programmatic representations, sequential decision-making, out-of-distribution problems, neural policies, OOD generalization

Summary:
In this position paper, the authors challenge the notion that programmatic policies are superior in generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems compared to neural policies. Through an analysis of existing literature, they demonstrate that neural policies can achieve similar levels of generalization as programmatic policies with simple modifications to their training pipeline. By utilizing simpler neural architectures and different reward functions that encourage safer behaviors, neural policies can improve OOD generalization. The authors also argue for the creation of benchmark problems that specifically test concepts necessary for OOD generalization, such as tasks that require algorithmic constructs like stacks. This study highlights the importance of reevaluating the perceived advantages of programmatic representations in solving sequential decision-making problems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for learning programmatic representations for sequential decision-making problems are often evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, with the common conclusion that programmatic policies generalize better than neural policies on OOD problems. In this position paper, we argue that commonly used benchmarks undervalue the generalization capabilities of programmatic representations. We analyze the experiments of four papers from the literature and show that neural policies, which were shown not to generalize, can generalize as effectively as programmatic policies on OOD problems. This is achieved with simple changes in the neural policies training pipeline. Namely, we show that simpler neural architectures with the same type of sparse observation used with programmatic policies can help attain OOD generalization. Another modification we have shown to be effective is the use of reward functions that allow for safer policies (e.g., agents that drive slowly can generalize better). Also, we argue for creating benchmark problems highlighting concepts needed for OOD generalization that may challenge neural policies but align with programmatic representations, such as tasks requiring algorithmic constructs like stacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in a partially observable, cooperative-competitive combat environment known as LAG. We describe the environment's setup, including agent actions, hierarchical controls, and reward design across different combat modes such as No Weapon and ShootMissile. Two representative algorithms are evaluated: HAPPO, an on-policy hierarchical variant of PPO, and HASAC, an off-policy method based on soft actor-critic. We analyze their training stability, reward progression, and inter-agent coordination capabilities. Experimental results show that HASAC performs well in simpler coordination tasks without weapons, while HAPPO demonstrates stronger adaptability in more dynamic and expressive scenarios involving missile combat. These findings provide insights into the trade-offs between on-policy and off-policy methods in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: We adapt the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to generative modeling by reinterpreting its inner functions as a Markov Kernel between probability spaces via inverse transform sampling. We present a generative model that is interpretable, easy to design, and efficient. Our approach couples a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network generator with independent energy-based priors, trained via Maximum Likelihood. Inverse sampling enables fast inference, while prior knowledge can be incorporated before training to better align priors with posteriors, thereby improving learning efficiency and sample quality. The learned prior is also recoverable and visualizable post-training, offering an empirical Bayes perspective. To address inflexibility and mitigate prior-posterior mismatch, we introduce scalable extensions based on mixture distributions and Langevin Monte Carlo methods, admitting a trade-off between flexibility and training efficiency. Our contributions connect classical representation theorems with modern probabilistic modeling, while balancing training stability, inference speed, and the quality and diversity of generations.

Abstract: We present a theory for the construction of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection features for neural networks. We introduce random features for OOD through a novel information-theoretic loss functional consisting of two terms, the first based on the KL divergence separates resulting in-distribution (ID) and OOD feature distributions and the second term is the Information Bottleneck, which favors compressed features that retain the OOD information. We formulate a variational procedure to optimize the loss and obtain OOD features. Based on assumptions on OOD distributions, one can recover properties of existing OOD features, i.e., shaping functions. Furthermore, we show that our theory can predict a new shaping function that out-performs existing ones on OOD benchmarks. Our theory provides a general framework for constructing a variety of new features with clear explainability.

Training large neural networks using traditional end-to-end backpropagation methods leads to memory bottlenecks, hindering widespread access to advanced AI research. The proposed DiffusionBlocks framework offers a novel approach by viewing neural network blocks as denoising operations within a continuous diffusion process.

We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a novel training framework that interprets neural network blocks as performing denoising operations in a continuous-time diffusion process. By partitioning the network into independently trainable blocks and optimizing noise level assignments based on equal cumulative probability mass, our approach achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional backpropagation in generative tasks. Experiments on image generation and language modeling tasks demonstrate memory reduction proportional to the number of blocks while achieving superior performance. DiffusionBlocks provides a promising pathway for democratizing access to large-scale neural network training with limited computational resources.

Summary:
TriGuard is a safety evaluation framework for deep neural networks that combines formal robustness verification, attribution entropy, and a novel Attribution Drift Score to assess model reliability under adversarial and distributional shifts. The framework highlights mismatches between model accuracy and interpretability, showing that verified models can still exhibit unstable reasoning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often achieve high accuracy, but ensuring their reliability under adversarial and distributional shifts remains a pressing challenge. We propose TriGuard, a unified safety evaluation framework that combines (1) formal robustness verification, (2) attribution entropy to quantify saliency concentration, and (3) a novel Attribution Drift Score measuring explanation stability. TriGuard reveals critical mismatches between model accuracy and interpretability: verified models can still exhibit unstable reasoning, and attribution-based signals provide complementary safety insights beyond adversarial accuracy. Extensive experiments across three datasets and five architectures show how TriGuard uncovers subtle fragilities in neural reasoning. We further demonstrate that entropy-regularized training reduces explanation drift without sacrificing performance. TriGuard advances the frontier in robust, interpretable model evaluation.

<div> Graph neural networks, homophily estimation, Large Language Models, spectral filters, performance improvement <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate the homophily of a graph, enhancing the performance of Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs). By leveraging LLMs to generate homophily-aware priors, the filters in SGNNs are adaptively designed to better align with the underlying graph topology. The proposed LLM-driven SGNN framework outperforms existing baselines in both homophilic and heterophilic settings on benchmark datasets. This approach provides improved expressiveness and adaptability for SGNNs across diverse graph structures. The lightweight pipeline developed in this study incurs minimal computational and monetary overhead, making it a practical and efficient solution for enhancing the performance of SGNNs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to approximate arbitrary filters. They typically rely on supervision from downstream tasks to adaptively learn appropriate filters. However, under label-scarce conditions, SGNNs may learn suboptimal filters, leading to degraded performance. Meanwhile, the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential within the GNN domain. This naturally raises an important question: \textit{Can LLMs help overcome the limitations of SGNNs and enhance their performance?} In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily of a given graph. The estimated homophily is then used to adaptively guide the design of polynomial spectral filters, thereby improving the expressiveness and adaptability of SGNNs across diverse graph structures. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight pipeline in which the LLM generates homophily-aware priors, which are injected into the filter coefficients to better align with the underlying graph topology. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-driven SGNN framework consistently outperforms existing baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic settings, with minimal computational and monetary overhead.

<div> DP-Ditto, personalized federated learning, privacy, model convergence, performance fairness <br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces DP-Ditto, a personalized federated learning approach that incorporates differential privacy to protect client privacy. It addresses the trade-off between privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness in personalized learning. The convergence upper bound of personalized models under DP-Ditto is analyzed, determining the optimal number of global aggregations for a given privacy budget. Performance fairness is also assessed, showing the potential for joint optimization of DP-Ditto for convergence and fairness. Experimental results indicate that DP-Ditto outperforms DP-perturbed versions of other state-of-the-art PFL models in terms of fairness and accuracy, surpassing them by 32.71% and 9.66%, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL), e.g., the renowned Ditto, strikes a balance between personalization and generalization by conducting federated learning (FL) to guide personalized learning (PL). While FL is unaffected by personalized model training, in Ditto, PL depends on the outcome of the FL. However, the clients' concern about their privacy and consequent perturbation of their local models can affect the convergence and (performance) fairness of PL. This paper presents PFL, called DP-Ditto, which is a non-trivial extension of Ditto under the protection of differential privacy (DP), and analyzes the trade-off among its privacy guarantee, model convergence, and performance distribution fairness. We also analyze the convergence upper bound of the personalized models under DP-Ditto and derive the optimal number of global aggregations given a privacy budget. Further, we analyze the performance fairness of the personalized models, and reveal the feasibility of optimizing DP-Ditto jointly for convergence and fairness. Experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate that DP-Ditto can surpass the DP-perturbed versions of the state-of-the-art PFL models, such as FedAMP, pFedMe, APPLE, and FedALA, by over 32.71% in fairness and 9.66% in accuracy.

<title>RL-Obfuscation: Can Language Models Learn to Evade Latent-Space Monitors?</title>

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.

Abstract: Adaptation is the holy grail of intelligence, but even the best AI models (like GPT) lack the adaptivity of toddlers. So the question remains: how can machines adapt quickly? Despite a lot of progress on model adaptation to facilitate continual and federated learning, as well as model merging, editing, unlearning, etc., little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can naturally learn to adapt in a similar way as humans and animals. Here, we show that all such adaptation methods can be seen as different ways of `correcting' the approximate posteriors. More accurate posteriors lead to smaller corrections, which in turn imply quicker adaptation. The result is obtained by using a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023) where interference created during adaptation is characterized by the natural-gradient mismatch over the past data. We present many examples to demonstrate the use of posterior-correction as a natural mechanism for the machines to learn to adapt quickly.

<title>Towards Robust Learning to Optimize with Theoretical Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) is an emerging technique to solve mathematical optimization problems with learning-based methods. Although with great success in many real-world scenarios such as wireless communications, computer networks, and electronic design, existing L2O works lack theoretical demonstration of their performance and robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We address this gap by providing comprehensive proofs. First, we prove a sufficient condition for a robust L2O model with homogeneous convergence rates over all In-Distribution (InD) instances. We assume an L2O model achieves robustness for an InD scenario. Based on our proposed methodology of aligning OOD problems to InD problems, we also demonstrate that the L2O model's convergence rate in OOD scenarios will deteriorate by an equation of the L2O model's input features. Moreover, we propose an L2O model with a concise gradient-only feature construction and a novel gradient-based history modeling method. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both InD and OOD scenarios and achieves up to 10 $\times$ convergence speedup. The code of our method can be found from https://github.com/NetX-lab/GoMathL2O-Official.

Abstract: Bayesian methods have recently been used to improve LoRA finetuning and, although they improve calibration, their effect on other metrics (such as accuracy) is marginal and can sometimes even be detrimental. Moreover, Bayesian methods also increase computational overheads and require additional tricks for them to work well. Here, we fix these issues by using a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON. We show that IVON is easy to implement and has similar costs to AdamW, and yet it can also drastically improve many metrics by using a simple posterior pruning technique. We present extensive results on billion-scale LLMs (Llama and Qwen series) going way beyond the scale of existing applications of IVON. For example, we finetune a Llama-3.2-3B model on a set of commonsense reasoning tasks and improve accuracy over AdamW by 1.3% and reduce ECE by 5.4%, outperforming AdamW and other recent Bayesian methods like Laplace-LoRA and BLoB. Overall, our results show that variational learning with IVON can effectively improve LoRA finetuning.

<title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.

Abstract: Fairness has been identified as an important aspect of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions for decision making. Recent literature offers a variety of approaches for debiasing, however many of them fall short when the data collection is imbalanced. In this paper, we focus on a particular case, fairness in doubly imbalanced datasets, such that the data collection is imbalanced both for the label and the groups in the sensitive attribute. Firstly, we present an exploratory analysis to illustrate limitations in debiasing on a doubly imbalanced dataset. Then, a multi-criteria based solution is proposed for finding the most suitable sampling and distribution for label and sensitive attribute, in terms of fairness and classification accuracy

<title>IntelliLung: Advancing Safe Mechanical Ventilation using Offline RL with Hybrid Actions and Clinically Aligned Rewards</title>

Abstract: Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-sustaining therapy for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards. Our findings demonstrate that AI-assisted MV optimization may enhance patient safety and enable individualized lung support, representing a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.

Abstract: Residual connections remain ubiquitous in modern neural network architectures nearly a decade after their introduction. Their widespread adoption is often credited to their dramatically improved trainability: residual networks train faster, more stably, and achieve higher accuracy than their feedforward counterparts. While numerous techniques, ranging from improved initialization to advanced learning rate schedules, have been proposed to close the performance gap between residual and feedforward networks, this gap has persisted. In this work, we propose an alternative explanation: residual networks do not merely reparameterize feedforward networks, but instead inhabit a different function space. We design a controlled post-training comparison to isolate generalization performance from trainability; we find that variable-depth architectures, similar to ResNets, consistently outperform fixed-depth networks, even when optimization is unlikely to make a difference. These results suggest that residual connections confer performance advantages beyond optimization, pointing instead to a deeper inductive bias aligned with the structure of natural data.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making and trusting the reliability of Deep Machine Learning Models is crucial for adopting such methods to safety-relevant applications. We extend self-explainable Prototypical Variational models with autoencoder-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection: A Variational Autoencoder is applied to learn a meaningful latent space which can be used for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation for OOD detection, and reconstruction. The In-Distribution (ID) region is defined by a Gaussian mixture distribution with learned prototypes representing the center of each mode. Furthermore, a novel restriction loss is introduced that promotes a compact ID region in the latent space without collapsing it into single points. The reconstructive capabilities of the Autoencoder ensure the explainability of the prototypes and the ID region of the classifier, further aiding the discrimination of OOD samples. Extensive evaluations on common OOD detection benchmarks as well as a large-scale dataset from a real-world railway application demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to support clinical decision-making. However, real-world medical datasets are often noisy, incomplete, and imbalanced, leading to performance disparities across patient subgroups. These differences raise fairness concerns, particularly when they reinforce existing disadvantages for marginalized groups. In this work, we analyze several medical prediction tasks and demonstrate how model performance varies with patient characteristics. While ML models may demonstrate good overall performance, we argue that subgroup-level evaluation is essential before integrating them into clinical workflows. By conducting a performance analysis at the subgroup level, differences can be clearly identified-allowing, on the one hand, for performance disparities to be considered in clinical practice, and on the other hand, for these insights to inform the responsible development of more effective models. Thereby, our work contributes to a practical discussion around the subgroup-sensitive development and deployment of medical ML models and the interconnectedness of fairness and transparency.

Abstract: In standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings, the interaction between the agent and the environment is typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that the agent observes the system state instantaneously, selects an action without delay, and executes it immediately. In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable, meaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the interaction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and seamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA), which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a wide range of locomotion benchmark environments.

Abstract: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to discover diverse behaviors that can accelerate the learning of downstream tasks. Previous methods typically focus on entropy-based exploration or empowerment-driven skill learning. However, entropy-based exploration struggles in large-scale state spaces (e.g., images), and empowerment-based methods with Mutual Information (MI) estimations have limitations in state exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skill discovery objective that maximizes the deviation of the state density of one skill from the explored regions of other skills, encouraging inter-skill state diversity similar to the initial MI objective. For state-density estimation, we construct a novel conditional autoencoder with soft modularization for different skill policies in high-dimensional space. Meanwhile, to incentivize intra-skill exploration, we formulate an intrinsic reward based on the learned autoencoder that resembles count-based exploration in a compact latent space. Through extensive experiments in challenging state and image-based tasks, we find our method learns meaningful skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks.

arXiv:2506.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/MoORE.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex, structured data, particularly where hierarchical or tree-like relationships are present. By enabling embeddings with lower distortion, hyperbolic neural networks offer promising alternatives to Euclidean-based models for capturing intricate data structures. Despite these advantages, they often face performance challenges, particularly in computational efficiency and tasks requiring high precision. In this work, we address these limitations by simplifying key operations within hyperbolic neural networks, achieving notable improvements in both runtime and performance. Our findings demonstrate that streamlined hyperbolic operations can lead to substantial gains in computational speed and predictive accuracy, making hyperbolic neural networks a more viable choice for a broader range of applications.

<title>A General Framework for Off-Policy Learning with Partially-Observed Reward</title>

Abstract: Off-policy learning (OPL) in contextual bandits aims to learn a decision-making policy that maximizes the target rewards by using only historical interaction data collected under previously developed policies. Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially-observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along with statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods in various scenarios.

Abstract: Label-free imaging has gained broad interest because of its potential to omit elaborate staining procedures which is especially relevant for in vivo use. Label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), for instance, exploits two-photon excitation of natural autofluorescence (AF) from native, metabolic proteins, making it ideal for in vivo endomicroscopy. Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in other optical imaging technologies to predict specific target annotations and thereby digitally augment the specificity of these label-free images. However, this computational specificity has only rarely been implemented for MPM. In this work, we used a data set of label-free MPM images from a series of different immune cell types (5,075 individual cells for binary classification in mixed samples and 3,424 cells for a multi-class classification task) and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cell types based on this label-free AF as input. A low-complexity squeezeNet architecture was able to achieve reliable immune cell classification results (0.89 ROC-AUC, 0.95 PR-AUC, for binary classification in mixed samples; 0.689 F1 score, 0.697 precision, 0.748 recall, and 0.683 MCC for six-class classification in isolated samples). Perturbation tests confirmed that the model is not confused by extracellular environment and that both input AF channels (NADH and FAD) are about equally important to the classification. In the future, such predictive DL models could directly detect specific immune cells in unstained images and thus, computationally improve the specificity of label-free MPM which would have great potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.

<title>Dataset distillation for memorized data: Soft labels can leak held-out teacher knowledge</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to compress training data into fewer examples via a teacher, from which a student can learn effectively. While its success is often attributed to structure in the data, modern neural networks also memorize specific facts, but if and how such memorized information is can transferred in distillation settings remains less understood. In this work, we show that students trained on soft labels from teachers can achieve non-trivial accuracy on held-out memorized data they never directly observed. This effect persists on structured data when the teacher has not generalized.To analyze it in isolation, we consider finite random i.i.d. datasets where generalization is a priori impossible and a successful teacher fit implies pure memorization. Still, students can learn non-trivial information about the held-out data, in some cases up to perfect accuracy. In those settings, enough soft labels are available to recover the teacher functionally - the student matches the teacher's predictions on all possible inputs, including the held-out memorized data. We show that these phenomena strongly depend on the temperature with which the logits are smoothed, but persist across varying network capacities, architectures and dataset compositions.

Abstract: Depression is a significant mental health concern, particularly in professional environments where work-related stress, financial pressure, and lifestyle imbalances contribute to deteriorating well-being. Despite increasing awareness, researchers and practitioners face critical challenges in developing accurate and generalizable predictive models for mental health disorders. Traditional classification approaches often struggle with the complexity of depression, as it is influenced by multifaceted, interdependent factors, including occupational stress, sleep patterns, and job satisfaction. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a stacking-based ensemble learning approach to improve the predictive accuracy of depression classification among professionals. The Depression Professional Dataset has been collected from Kaggle. The dataset comprises demographic, occupational, and lifestyle attributes that influence mental well-being. Our stacking model integrates multiple base learners with a logistic regression-mediated model, effectively capturing diverse learning patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high predictive performance, with an accuracy of 99.64% on training data and 98.75% on testing data, with precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 98%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning in mental health analytics and underscore its potential for early detection and intervention strategies.

Abstract: Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO) provides powerful tools for optimizing functions where explicit gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. However, the underlying mechanisms of popular ZOO methods, particularly those employing randomized finite differences, and their connection to other optimization paradigms like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are not fully elucidated. This paper establishes a fundamental and previously unrecognized connection: ZOO with finite differences is equivalent to a specific instance of single-step Policy Optimization (PO). We formally unveil that the implicitly smoothed objective function optimized by common ZOO algorithms is identical to a single-step PO objective. Furthermore, we show that widely used ZOO gradient estimators, are mathematically equivalent to the REINFORCE gradient estimator with a specific baseline function, revealing the variance-reducing mechanism in ZOO from a PO perspective.Built on this unified framework, we propose ZoAR (Zeroth-Order Optimization with Averaged Baseline and Query Reuse), a novel ZOO algorithm incorporating PO-inspired variance reduction techniques: an averaged baseline from recent evaluations and query reuse analogous to experience replay. Our theoretical analysis further substantiates these techniques reduce variance and enhance convergence. Extensive empirical studies validate our theory and demonstrate that ZoAR significantly outperforms other methods in terms of convergence speed and final performance. Overall, our work provides a new theoretical lens for understanding ZOO and offers practical algorithmic improvements derived from its connection to PO.

<title>Leveraging External Factors in Household-Level Electrical Consumption Forecasting using Hypernetworks</title>

Abstract: Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer.
  We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.

<title>Train Once, Forget Precisely: Anchored Optimization for Efficient Post-Hoc Unlearning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly rely on data subject to privacy regulation, selectively unlearning specific information from trained models has become essential. In image classification, this involves removing the influence of particular training samples, semantic classes, or visual styles without full retraining. We introduce \textbf{Forget-Aligned Model Reconstruction (FAMR)}, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for post-hoc unlearning in deep image classifiers. FAMR frames forgetting as a constrained optimization problem that minimizes a uniform-prediction loss on the forget set while anchoring model parameters to their original values via an $\ell_2$ penalty. A theoretical analysis links FAMR's solution to influence-function-based retraining approximations, with bounds on parameter and output deviation. Empirical results on class forgetting tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate FAMR's effectiveness, with strong performance retention and minimal computational overhead. The framework generalizes naturally to concept and style erasure, offering a scalable and certifiable route to efficient post-hoc forgetting in vision models.

<title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Games with Bandit Feedback</title>

Abstract: We study a two-player zero-sum game (TPZSG) in which the row player aims to maximize their payoff against an adversarial column player, under an unknown payoff matrix estimated through bandit feedback. We propose and analyze two algorithms: ETC-TPZSG, which directly applies ETC to the TPZSG setting and ETC-TPZSG-AE, which improves upon it by incorporating an action pair elimination (AE) strategy that leverages the $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium property to efficiently select the optimal action pair. Our objective is to demonstrate the applicability of ETC in a TPZSG setting by focusing on learning pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. A key contribution of our work is a derivation of instance-dependent upper bounds on the expected regret for both algorithms, has received limited attention in the literature on zero-sum games. Particularly, after $T$ rounds, we achieve an instance-dependent regret upper bounds of $O(\Delta + \sqrt{T})$ for ETC-TPZSG and $O(\frac{\log (T \Delta^2)}{\Delta})$ for ETC-TPZSG-AE, where $\Delta$ denotes the suboptimality gap. Therefore, our results indicate that ETC-based algorithms perform effectively in adversarial game settings, achieving regret bounds comparable to existing methods while providing insights through instance-dependent analysis.

Abstract: Are current artificial intelligence (AI) research methodologies ready to create successful, productive, and profitable AI applications? This work presents a case study on an industrial AI use case called false call reduction for automated optical inspection to demonstrate the shortcomings of current best practices. We identify seven weaknesses prevalent in related peer-reviewed work and experimentally show their consequences. We show that the best-practice methodology would fail for this use case. We argue amongst others for the necessity of requirement-aware metrics to ensure achieving business objectives, clear definitions of success criteria, and a thorough analysis of temporal dynamics in experimental datasets. Our work encourages researchers to critically assess their methodologies for more successful applied AI research.

Abstract: Effective decision-making on networks often relies on learning from graph-structured data, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) play a central role, but they take efforts to configure and tune. In this demo, we propose LLMNet, showing how to design GNN automated through Large Language Models. Our system develops a set of agents that construct graph-related knowlege bases and then leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support automated configuration and refinement of GNN models through a knowledge-guided evolution process. These agents, equipped with specialized knowledge bases, extract insights into tasks and graph structures by interacting with the knowledge bases. Empirical results show LLMNet excels in twelve datasets across three graph learning tasks, validating its effectiveness of GNN model designing.

<title>Aligning Evaluation with Clinical Priorities: Calibration, Label Shift, and Error Costs</title>

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision support systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, where probabilistic scoring functions are used to inform and prioritize patient management decisions. However, widely used scoring rules, such as accuracy and AUC-ROC, fail to adequately reflect key clinical priorities, including calibration, robustness to distributional shifts, and sensitivity to asymmetric error costs. In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance. The resulting evaluation is simple to apply, sensitive to clinical deployment conditions, and designed to prioritize models that are both calibrated and robust to real-world variations.

Abstract: We present the Gaussian process dynamical mixture model (GPDMM) and show its utility in single-example learning of human motion data. The Gaussian process dynamical model (GPDM) is a form of the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM), but optimized with a hidden Markov model dynamical prior. The GPDMM combines multiple GPDMs in a probabilistic mixture-of-experts framework, utilizing embedded geometric features to allow for diverse sequences to be encoded in a single latent space, enabling the categorization and generation of each sequence class. GPDMs and our mixture model are particularly advantageous in addressing the challenges of modeling human movement in scenarios where data is limited and model interpretability is vital, such as in patient-specific medical applications like prosthesis control. We score the GPDMM on classification accuracy and generative ability in single-example learning, showcase model variations, and benchmark it against LSTMs, VAEs, and transformers.

<title>TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/TGDPO.

Abstract: Over the last decade, as we rely more on deep learning technologies to make critical decisions, concerns regarding their safety, reliability and interpretability have emerged. We introduce a novel Neural Argumentative Learning (NAL) architecture that integrates Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with deep learning for image analysis. Our architecture consists of neural and symbolic components. The former segments and encodes images into facts using object-centric learning, while the latter applies ABA learning to develop ABA frameworks enabling predictions with images. Experiments on synthetic data show that the NAL architecture can be competitive with a state-of-the-art alternative.

Abstract: Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

Abstract: Real-time identification and quantification of greenhouse-gas emissions under transient atmospheric conditions is a critical challenge in environmental monitoring. We introduce a spatio-temporal inversion framework that embeds a deep-learning surrogate of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference of both emission rate and source location in dynamic flow fields. By substituting costly numerical solvers with a multilayer perceptron trained on high-fidelity CFD outputs, our surrogate captures spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of gas dispersion, while delivering near-real-time predictions. Validation on the Chilbolton methane release dataset demonstrates comparable accuracy to full CFD solvers and Gaussian plume models, yet achieves orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes. Further experiments under simulated obstructed-flow scenarios confirm robustness in complex environments. This work reconciles physical fidelity with computational feasibility, offering a scalable solution for industrial emissions monitoring and other time-sensitive spatio-temporal inversion tasks in environmental and scientific modeling.

<title>Expressive Score-Based Priors for Distribution Matching with Geometry-Preserving Regularization</title>

Abstract: Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation learning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification, domain adaptation, and domain translation. Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for solving real-world optimization tasks under tight evaluation budgets, making it well-suited for applications involving costly simulations or experiments. However, many of these tasks are also characterized by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical formulation is unknown and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where feasible regions are small, irregular, and difficult to identify. In such cases, a substantial portion of the optimization budget may be spent just trying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines a trust region from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information from both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy allows the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations, enabling the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently accelerate the discovery of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite and other physics-inspired benchmarks, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines for constrained black-box optimization across varying levels of constraint severity and problem dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explainers (VCEs) are a straightforward and promising approach to enhancing the transparency of image classifiers. VCEs complement other types of explanations, such as feature attribution, by revealing the specific data transformations to which a machine learning model responds most strongly. In this paper, we argue that existing VCEs focus too narrowly on optimizing sample quality or change minimality; they fail to consider the more holistic desiderata for an explanation, such as fidelity, understandability, and sufficiency. To address this shortcoming, we explore new mechanisms for counterfactual generation and investigate how they can help fulfill these desiderata. We combine these mechanisms into a novel 'smooth counterfactual explorer' (SCE) algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness through systematic evaluations on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: We study the task of bandit learning, also known as best-arm identification, under the assumption that the true reward function f belongs to a known, but arbitrary, function class F. We seek a general theory of bandit learnability, akin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by the following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how they are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification, learnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC dimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely, empirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic results, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits, offering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the question of "which", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable classes via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a simple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize bandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of dimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of "how", we prove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for which at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no algorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this class admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often considered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational hardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning. Beyond these results, we investigate additional themes such as learning under noise, trade-offs between noise models, and the relationship between query complexity and regret minimization.

Abstract: The upcoming 6G will fundamentally reshape mobile networks beyond communications, unlocking a multitude of applications that were once considered unimaginable. Meanwhile, security and resilience are especially highlighted in the 6G design principles. However, safeguarding 6G networks will be quite challenging due to various known and unknown threats from highly heterogeneous networks and diversified security requirements of distinct use cases, calling for a comprehensive re-design of security architecture. This motivates us to propose ES3A (Entire Smart Service-based Security Architecture), a novel security architecture for 6G networks. Specifically, we first discuss six high-level principles of our ES3A that include hierarchy, flexibility, scalability, resilience, endogeny, and trust and privacy. With these goals in mind, we then introduce three guidelines from a deployment perspective, envisioning our ES3A that offers service-based security, end-to-end protection, and smart security automation for 6G networks. Our architecture consists of three layers and three domains. It relies on a two-stage orchestration mechanism to tailor smart security strategies for customized protection in high-dynamic 6G networks, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. Finally, we prototype the proposed ES3A on a real-world radio system based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR). Experiments show the effectiveness of our ES3A. We also provide a case to show the superiority of our architecture.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have transformed visual content creation, producing highly realistic images from natural language prompts. However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize the need for more inclusive datasets and development practices to foster fairness in generative visual systems.

Abstract: How does the threat of infectious disease influence sociality among generative agents? We used generative agent-based modeling (GABM), powered by large language models, to experimentally test hypotheses about the behavioral immune system. Across three simulation runs, generative agents who read news about an infectious disease outbreak showed significantly reduced social engagement compared to agents who received no such news, including lower attendance at a social gathering, fewer visits to third places (e.g., cafe, store, park), and fewer conversations throughout the town. In interview responses, agents explicitly attributed their behavioral changes to disease-avoidance motivations. A validity check further indicated that they could distinguish between infectious and noninfectious diseases, selectively reducing social engagement only when there was a risk of infection. Our findings highlight the potential of GABM as an experimental tool for exploring complex human social dynamics at scale.

<title>Analysis of Anonymous User Interaction Relationships and Prediction of Advertising Feedback Based on Graph Neural Network</title>

Abstract: While online advertising is highly dependent on implicit interaction networks of anonymous users for engagement inference, and for the selection and optimization of delivery strategies, existing graph models seldom can capture the multi-scale temporal, semantic and higher-order dependency features of these interaction networks, thus it's hard to describe the complicated patterns of the anonymous behavior. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Temporal-Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (DTH-GNN), which achieves three main contributions. Above all, we introduce temporal edge decomposition, which divides each interaction into three types of channels: short-term burst, diurnal cycle and long-range memory, and conducts feature extraction using the convolution kernel of parallel dilated residuals; Furthermore, our model builds a hierarchical heterogeneous aggregation, where user-user, user-advertisement, advertisement-advertisement subgraphs are combined through the meta-path conditional Transformer encoder, where the noise structure is dynamically tamped down via the synergy of cross-channel self-attention and gating relationship selector. Thirdly, the contrast regularity of feedback perception is formulated, the consistency of various time slices is maximized, the entropy of control exposure information with dual-view target is maximized, the global prototype of dual-momentum queue distillation is presented, and the strategy gradient layer with light weight is combined with delaying transformation signal to fine-tune the node representation for benefit-oriented. The AUC of DTH-GNN improved by 8.2% and the logarithmic loss improved by 5.7% in comparison with the best baseline model.

Abstract: We introduce ICE-ID, a novel benchmark dataset for historical identity resolution, comprising 220 years (1703-1920) of Icelandic census records. ICE-ID spans multiple generations of longitudinal data, capturing name variations, demographic changes, and rich genealogical links. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, open tabular dataset specifically designed to study long-term person-entity matching in a real-world population. We define identity resolution tasks (within and across census waves) with clearly documented metrics and splits. We evaluate a range of methods: handcrafted rule-based matchers, a ML ensemble as well as LLMs for structured data (e.g. transformer-based tabular networks) against a novel approach to tabular data called NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) - a general-purpose AI framework designed to reason with limited knowledge and resources. Its core is Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL), a term-based logic. Our experiments show that NARS is suprisingly simple and competitive with other standard approaches, achieving SOTA at our task. By releasing ICE-ID and our code, we enable reproducible benchmarking of identity resolution approaches in longitudinal settings and hope that ICE-ID opens new avenues for cross-disciplinary research in data linkage and historical analytics.

<title>Causality in the human niche: lessons for machine learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13803</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Humans interpret the world around them in terms of cause and effect and communicate their understanding of the world to each other in causal terms. These causal aspects of human cognition are thought to underlie humans' ability to generalize and learn efficiently in new domains, an area where current machine learning systems are weak. Building human-like causal competency into machine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and interpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing ideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, which provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has led to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some salient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to advances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We contend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social, autonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which humans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs. For example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal properties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object (cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between objects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to express in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and motivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human causal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche in which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine learning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create more capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.

Abstract: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

Abstract: Generative AI foundation models offer transformative potential for processing structured biological data, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing, where datasets are rapidly scaling toward billions of cells. We propose the use of agentic foundation models with real-time web search to automate the labeling of experimental data, achieving up to 82.5% accuracy. This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell-typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large-scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain-specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.

Abstract: Synthetic data, which is artificially generated and intelligently mimicking or supplementing the real-world data, is increasingly used. The proliferation of AI agents and the adoption of synthetic data create a synthetic mirror that conceptualizes a representation and potential distortion of reality, thus generating trust and accountability deficits. This paper explores the implications for privacy and policymaking stemming from synthetic data generation, and the urgent need for new policy instruments and legal framework adaptation to ensure appropriate levels of trust and accountability for AI agents relying on synthetic data. Rather than creating entirely new policy or legal regimes, the most practical approach involves targeted amendments to existing frameworks, recognizing synthetic data as a distinct regulatory category with unique characteristics.

Abstract: In this study, we present a dual-modal AI framework based on short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. The first modality employs a multi-wavelength SWIR imaging system coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatial features linked to glucose absorption. The second modality uses a compact photodiode voltage sensor and machine learning regressors (e.g., random forest) on normalized optical signals. Both approaches were evaluated on synthetic blood phantoms and skin-mimicking materials across physiological glucose levels (70 to 200 mg/dL). The CNN achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.82% at 650 nm with 100% Zone A coverage in the Clarke Error Grid, while the photodiode system reached 86.4% Zone A accuracy. This framework constitutes a state-of-the-art solution that balances clinical accuracy, cost efficiency, and wearable integration, paving the way for reliable continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring.

Abstract: Silent speech decoding, which performs unvocalized human speech recognition from electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), increases accessibility for speech-impaired humans. However, data collection is difficult and performed using varying experimental setups, making it nontrivial to collect a large, homogeneous dataset. In this study we introduce neural networks that can handle EEG/EMG with heterogeneous electrode placements and show strong performance in silent speech decoding via multi-task training on large-scale EEG/EMG datasets. We achieve improved word classification accuracy in both healthy participants (95.3%), and a speech-impaired patient (54.5%), substantially outperforming models trained on single-subject data (70.1% and 13.2%). Moreover, our models also show gains in cross-language calibration performance. This increase in accuracy suggests the feasibility of developing practical silent speech decoding systems, particularly for speech-impaired patients.

Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.

Abstract: Cooperative game theory has become a cornerstone of post-hoc interpretability in machine learning, largely through the use of Shapley values. Yet, despite their widespread adoption, Shapley-based methods often rest on axiomatic justifications whose relevance to feature attribution remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit cooperative game theory from an interpretability perspective and argue for a broader and more principled use of its tools. We highlight two general families of efficient allocations, the Weber and Harsanyi sets, that extend beyond Shapley values and offer richer interpretative flexibility. We present an accessible overview of these allocation schemes, clarify the distinction between value functions and aggregation rules, and introduce a three-step blueprint for constructing reliable and theoretically-grounded feature attributions. Our goal is to move beyond fixed axioms and provide the XAI community with a coherent framework to design attribution methods that are both meaningful and robust to shifting methodological trends.

<title>A Systematic Review of User-Centred Evaluation of Explainable AI in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Despite promising developments in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, the practical value of XAI methods remains under-explored and insufficiently validated in real-world settings. Robust and context-aware evaluation is essential, not only to produce understandable explanations but also to ensure their trustworthiness and usability for intended users, but tends to be overlooked because of no clear guidelines on how to design an evaluation with users.
  This study addresses this gap with two main goals: (1) to develop a framework of well-defined, atomic properties that characterise the user experience of XAI in healthcare; and (2) to provide clear, context-sensitive guidelines for defining evaluation strategies based on system characteristics.
  We conducted a systematic review of 82 user studies, sourced from five databases, all situated within healthcare settings and focused on evaluating AI-generated explanations. The analysis was guided by a predefined coding scheme informed by an existing evaluation framework, complemented by inductive codes developed iteratively.
  The review yields three key contributions: (1) a synthesis of current evaluation practices, highlighting a growing focus on human-centred approaches in healthcare XAI; (2) insights into the interrelations among explanation properties; and (3) an updated framework and a set of actionable guidelines to support interdisciplinary teams in designing and implementing effective evaluation strategies for XAI systems tailored to specific application contexts.

Abstract: Coordinated campaigns frequently exploit social media platforms by artificially amplifying topics, making inauthentic trends appear organic, and misleading users into engagement. Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\% and 5\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter.

Abstract: Most existing literature on supervised machine learning assumes that the training dataset is drawn from an i.i.d. sample. However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.

Abstract: We address the regression problem under the constraint of demographic parity, a commonly used fairness definition. Recent studies have revealed fair minimax optimal regression algorithms, the most accurate algorithms that adhere to the fairness constraint. However, these analyses are tightly coupled with specific data generation models. In this paper, we provide meta-theorems that can be applied to various situations to validate the fair minimax optimality of the corresponding regression algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fair minimax optimal regression can be achieved through post-processing methods, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on improving conventional regression techniques, which can then be efficiently adapted for fair regression.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid machine learning scheme to learn -- in physics-informed and numerical analysis-informed fashion -- invariant manifolds (IM) of discrete maps for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for dynamical systems. The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical task across domains such as cybersecurity and healthcare. In the unsupervised setting, an effective and theoretically-grounded principle is to train classifiers to distinguish normal data from (synthetic) anomalies. We extend this principle to semi-supervised AD, where training data also include a limited labeled subset of anomalies possibly present in test time. We propose a theoretically-grounded and empirically effective framework for semi-supervised AD that combines known and synthetic anomalies during training. To analyze semi-supervised AD, we introduce the first mathematical formulation of semi-supervised AD, which generalizes unsupervised AD. Here, we show that synthetic anomalies enable (i) better anomaly modeling in low-density regions and (ii) optimal convergence guarantees for neural network classifiers -- the first theoretical result for semi-supervised AD. We empirically validate our framework on five diverse benchmarks, observing consistent performance gains. These improvements also extend beyond our theoretical framework to other classification-based AD methods, validating the generalizability of the synthetic anomaly principle in AD.

Abstract: Storm surge is one of the deadliest hazards posed by tropical cyclones (TCs), yet assessing its current and future risk is difficult due to the phenomenon's rarity and physical complexity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence applications to natural hazard modeling suggest a new avenue for addressing this problem. We utilize a deep learning storm surge model to efficiently estimate coastal surge risk in the United States from 900,000 synthetic TC events, accounting for projected changes in TC behavior and sea levels. The derived historical 100-year surge (the event with a 1% yearly exceedance probability) agrees well with historical observations and other modeling techniques. When coupled with an inundation model, we find that heightened TC intensities and sea levels by the end of the century result in a 50% increase in population at risk. Key findings include markedly heightened risk in Florida, and critical thresholds identified in Georgia and South Carolina.

Abstract: Mammographic breast density classification is essential for cancer risk assessment but remains challenging due to subjective interpretation and inter-observer variability. This study compares multimodal and CNN-based methods for automated classification using the BI-RADS system, evaluating BioMedCLIP and ConvNeXt across three learning scenarios: zero-shot classification, linear probing with textual descriptions, and fine-tuning with numerical labels. Results show that zero-shot classification achieved modest performance, while the fine-tuned ConvNeXt model outperformed the BioMedCLIP linear probe. Although linear probing demonstrated potential with pretrained embeddings, it was less effective than full fine-tuning. These findings suggest that despite the promise of multimodal learning, CNN-based models with end-to-end fine-tuning provide stronger performance for specialized medical imaging. The study underscores the need for more detailed textual representations and domain-specific adaptations in future radiology applications.

However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance. This shows an annotation-efficient framework for modeling videoconference experience.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a wide class Mirror Descent (MD) algorithms, which play a key role in machine learning. For this purpose we formulated the constrained optimization problem, in which we exploits the Bregman divergence with the Tempesta multi-parametric deformation logarithm as a link function. This link function called also mirror function defines the mapping between the primal and dual spaces and is associated with a very-wide (in fact, theoretically infinite) class of generalized trace-form entropies. In order to derive novel MD updates, we estimate generalized exponential function, which closely approximates the inverse of the multi-parametric Tempesta generalized logarithm. The shape and properties of the Tempesta logarithm and its inverse-deformed exponential functions can be tuned by several hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution or geometry of training data, and we can adjust them to achieve desired properties of MD algorithms. The concept of applying multi-parametric logarithms allow us to generate a new wide and flexible family of MD and mirror-less MD updates.

Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by allowing illicit funds to enter the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, only a small fraction is ever uncovered. This stems from a range of factors, including deliberate evasion by launderers, the rarity of confirmed cases, and the limited visibility each financial institution has into the global transaction network. While several synthetic datasets are available, they fail to model the structural and behavioral complexity of real-world money laundering. In particular, they often overlook partial observability, sparse and uncertain labels, strategic behavior, temporal dynamics, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. To address these limitations, we present AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. It enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) systems in a controlled environment that captures key real-world challenges. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to rigorously evaluate methods under conditions that reflect the complexity of practical AML scenarios.

Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting is crucial for public health, disaster preparedness, and agriculture, and yet it remains a particularly challenging timescale to predict. We explore the use of an interpretable AI-informed model analog forecasting approach, previously employed on longer timescales, to improve S2S predictions. Using an artificial neural network, we learn a mask of weights to optimize analog selection and showcase its versatility across three varied prediction tasks: 1) classification of Week 3-4 Southern California summer temperatures; 2) regional regression of Month 1 midwestern U.S. summer temperatures; and 3) classification of Month 1-2 North Atlantic wintertime upper atmospheric winds. The AI-informed analogs outperform traditional analog forecasting approaches, as well as climatology and persistence baselines, for deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on both climate model and reanalysis data. We find the analog ensembles built using the AI-informed approach also produce better predictions of temperature extremes and improve representation of forecast uncertainty. Finally, by using an interpretable-AI framework, we analyze the learned masks of weights to better understand S2S sources of predictability.

Abstract: Sketches have shown high accuracy in multi-way join cardinality estimation, a critical problem in cost-based query optimization. Accurately estimating the cardinality of a join operation -- analogous to its computational cost -- allows the optimization of query execution costs in relational database systems. However, although sketches have shown high efficacy in query optimization, they are typically constructed specifically for predefined selections in queries that are assumed to be given a priori, hindering their applicability to new queries. As a more general solution, we propose for Sum-Product Networks to dynamically approximate sketches on-the-fly. Sum-Product Networks can decompose and model multivariate distributions, such as relations, as linear combinations of multiple univariate distributions. By representing these univariate distributions as sketches, Sum-Product Networks can combine them element-wise to efficiently approximate the sketch of any query selection. These approximate sketches can then be applied to join cardinality estimation. In particular, we implement the Fast-AGMS and Bound Sketch methods, which have successfully been used in prior work, despite their costly construction. By accurately approximating them instead, our work provides a practical alternative to apply these sketches to query optimization.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation seeks to determine the impact of an intervention from observational data. However, the existing causal inference literature primarily addresses treatment effects on frequently occurring events. But what if we are interested in estimating the effects of a policy intervention whose benefits, while potentially important, can only be observed and measured in rare yet impactful events, such as extreme climate events? The standard causal inference methodology is not designed for this type of inference since the events of interest may be scarce in the observed data and some degree of extrapolation is necessary. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides methodologies for analyzing statistical phenomena in such extreme regimes. We introduce a novel framework for assessing treatment effects in extreme data to capture the causal effect at the occurrence of rare events of interest. In particular, we employ the theory of multivariate regular variation to model extremities. We develop a consistent estimator for extreme treatment effects and present a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of its performance. We illustrate the performance of our estimator using both synthetic and semi-synthetic data.

<title>Universal Rates of ERM for Agnostic Learning</title>

Abstract: The universal learning framework has been developed to obtain guarantees on the learning rates that hold for any fixed distribution, which can be much faster than the ones uniformly hold over all the distributions. Given that the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory and ubiquitous in practical machine learning, the recent work of arXiv:2412.02810 studied the universal rates of ERM for binary classification under the realizable setting. However, the assumption of realizability is too restrictive to hold in practice. Indeed, the majority of the literature on universal learning has focused on the realizable case, leaving the non-realizable case barely explored.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for binary classification under the agnostic setting, where the ''learning curve" reflects the decay of the excess risk as the sample size increases. We explore the possibilities of agnostic universal rates and reveal a compact trichotomy: there are three possible agnostic universal rates of ERM, being either $e^{-n}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories. Moreover, we also establish complete characterizations for the target-dependent universal rates as well as the Bayes-dependent universal rates.

Abstract: Data plays the most prominent role in how language models acquire skills and knowledge. The lack of massive, well-organized pre-training datasets results in costly and inaccessible data pipelines. We present Essential-Web v1.0, a 24-trillion-token dataset in which every document is annotated with a twelve-category taxonomy covering topic, format, content complexity, and quality. Taxonomy labels are produced by EAI-Distill-0.5b, a fine-tuned 0.5b-parameter model that achieves an annotator agreement within 3% of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. With nothing more than SQL-style filters, we obtain competitive web-curated datasets in math (-8.0% relative to SOTA), web code (+14.3%), STEM (+24.5%) and medical (+8.6%). Essential-Web v1.0 is available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/EssentialAI/essential-web-v1.0

Abstract: Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.

Abstract: Contact forces pose a major challenge for gradient-based optimization of robot dynamics as they introduce jumps in the system's velocities. Penalty-based simulators, such as MuJoCo, simplify gradient computation by softening the contact forces. However, realistically simulating hard contacts requires very stiff contact settings, which leads to incorrect gradients when using automatic differentiation. On the other hand, using non-stiff settings strongly increases the sim-to-real gap. We analyze the contact computation of penalty-based simulators to identify the causes of gradient errors. Then, we propose DiffMJX, which combines adaptive integration with MuJoCo XLA, to notably improve gradient quality in the presence of hard contacts. Finally, we address a key limitation of contact gradients: they vanish when objects do not touch. To overcome this, we introduce Contacts From Distance (CFD), a mechanism that enables the simulator to generate informative contact gradients even before objects are in contact. To preserve physical realism, we apply CFD only in the backward pass using a straight-through trick, allowing us to compute useful gradients without modifying the forward simulation.

Abstract: Action-labeled data for robotics is scarce and expensive, limiting the generalization of learned policies. In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models. More information can be found at https://amplify-robotics.github.io/.

Abstract: We propose a test for abstract causal reasoning in AI, based on scholarship in the philosophy of causation, in particular on the neuron diagrams popularized by D. Lewis. We illustrate the test on advanced Large Language Models (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Gemini). Remarkably, these chatbots are already capable of correctly identifying causes in cases that are hotly debated in the literature. In order to assess the results of these LLMs and future dedicated AI, we propose a definition of cause in neuron diagrams with a wider validity than published hitherto, which challenges the widespread view that such a definition is elusive. We submit that these results are an illustration of how future philosophical research might evolve: as an interplay between human and artificial expertise.

Abstract: Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%). Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.

Abstract: Imitation learning has driven the development of generalist policies capable of autonomously solving multiple tasks. However, when a pretrained policy makes errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1) inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.

Abstract: We present Sleeping-DISCO 9M, a large-scale pre-training dataset for music and song. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source high-quality dataset representing popular and well-known songs for generative music modeling tasks such as text-music, music-captioning, singing-voice synthesis, melody reconstruction and cross-model retrieval. Past contributions focused on isolated and constrained factors whose core perspective was to create synthetic or re-recorded music corpus (e.g. GTSinger, M4Singer) and arbitrarily large-scale audio datasets (e.g. DISCO-10M and LAIONDISCO-12M) had been another focus for the community. Unfortunately, adoption of these datasets has been below substantial in the generative music community as these datasets fail to reflect real-world music and its flavour. Our dataset changes this narrative and provides a dataset that is constructed using actual popular music and world-renowned artists.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for refining a given correspondence map between two shapes. A correspondence map represented as a functional map, namely a change of basis matrix, can be additionally treated as a 2D image. With this perspective, we train an image diffusion model directly in the space of functional maps, enabling it to generate accurate maps conditioned on an inaccurate initial map. The training is done purely in the functional space, and thus is highly efficient. At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process. The guidance can additionally encourage different functional map objectives, such as orthogonality and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods of map refinement and that guided diffusion models provide a promising pathway to functional map processing.

Abstract: There is growing interest in extending average treatment effect (ATE) estimation to incorporate non-tabular data, such as images and text, which may act as sources of confounding. Neglecting these effects risks biased results and flawed scientific conclusions. However, incorporating non-tabular data necessitates sophisticated feature extractors, often in combination with ideas of transfer learning. In this work, we investigate how latent features from pre-trained neural networks can be leveraged to adjust for sources of confounding. We formalize conditions under which these latent features enable valid adjustment and statistical inference in ATE estimation, demonstrating results along the example of double machine learning. We discuss critical challenges inherent to latent feature learning and downstream parameter estimation arising from the high dimensionality and non-identifiability of representations. Common structural assumptions for obtaining fast convergence rates with additive or sparse linear models are shown to be unrealistic for latent features. We argue, however, that neural networks are largely insensitive to these issues. In particular, we show that neural networks can achieve fast convergence rates by adapting to intrinsic notions of sparsity and dimension of the learning problem.

Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit strong performance on complex tasks through test-time inference scaling. However, prior studies have shown that these models often incur significant computational costs due to excessive reasoning, such as frequent switching between reasoning trajectories (e.g., underthinking) or redundant reasoning on simple questions (e.g., overthinking). In this work, we expose a novel threat: adversarial inputs can be crafted to exploit excessive reasoning behaviors and substantially increase computational overhead without compromising model utility. Therefore, we propose a novel loss framework consisting of three components: (1) Priority Cross-Entropy Loss, a modification of the standard cross-entropy objective that emphasizes key tokens by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LMs; (2) Excessive Reasoning Loss, which encourages the model to initiate additional reasoning paths during inference; and (3) Delayed Termination Loss, which is designed to extend the reasoning process and defer the generation of final outputs. We optimize and evaluate our attack for the GSM8K and ORCA datasets on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen. Empirical results demonstrate a 3x to 9x increase in reasoning length with comparable utility performance. Furthermore, our crafted adversarial inputs exhibit transferability, inducing computational overhead in o3-mini, o1-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and QWQ models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining their internal, parametric knowledge with external, non-parametric sources, with the goal of improving factual correctness and minimizing hallucinations. The LiveRAG 2025 challenge explores RAG solutions to maximize accuracy on DataMorgana's QA pairs, which are composed of single-hop and multi-hop questions. The challenge provides access to sparse OpenSearch and dense Pinecone indices of the Fineweb 10BT dataset. It restricts model use to LLMs with up to 10B parameters and final answer generation with Falcon-3-10B. A judge-LLM assesses the submitted answers along with human evaluators. By exploring distinct retriever combinations and RAG solutions under the challenge conditions, our final solution emerged using InstructRAG in combination with a Pinecone retriever and a BGE reranker. Our solution achieved a correctness score of 1.13 and a faithfulness score of 0.55, placing fourth in the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

<title>MoTE: Mixture of Ternary Experts for Memory-efficient Large Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Large multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) effectively scale the model size to boost performance while maintaining fixed active parameters. However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling. Despite they show superior performance on end tasks, the large amount of experts introduces higher memory footprint, which poses significant challenges for the deployment on edge devices. In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower. Given the same amount of expert memory footprint of 3.4GB and combined with post-training quantization, MoTE outperforms MoE-LLaVA by a gain of 4.3% average accuracy on end tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Model compression is critical for deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. We introduce a novel method enhancing knowledge distillation with integrated gradients (IG) as a data augmentation strategy. Our approach overlays IG maps onto input images during training, providing student models with deeper insights into teacher models' decision-making processes. Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset. These extensive ablation studies confirm that IG-based knowledge distillation consistently outperforms conventional approaches across varied architectures and compression ratios. Our results establish this framework as a viable compression technique for real-world deployment on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<title>A Scalable Hybrid Training Approach for Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) can be implemented very efficiently in neuromorphic systems. Nevertheless, training of these models with powerful gradient-based learning algorithms is mostly performed on standard digital hardware using Backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT has substantial limitations. It does not permit online training and its memory consumption scales linearly with the number of computation steps. In contrast, learning methods using forward propagation of gradients operate in an online manner with a memory consumption independent of the number of time steps. These methods enable SNNs to learn from continuous, infinite-length input sequences. Yet, slow execution speed on conventional hardware as well as inferior performance has hindered their widespread application. In this work, we introduce HYbrid PRopagation (HYPR) that combines the efficiency of parallelization with approximate online forward learning. Our algorithm yields high-throughput online learning through parallelization, paired with constant, i.e., sequence length independent, memory demands. HYPR enables parallelization of parameter update computation over the sub sequences for RSNNs consisting of almost arbitrary non-linear spiking neuron models. We apply HYPR to networks of spiking neurons with oscillatory subthreshold dynamics. We find that this type of neuron model is particularly well trainable by HYPR, resulting in an unprecedentedly low task performance gap between approximate forward gradient learning and BPTT.

Abstract: One-shot subset selection serves as an effective tool to reduce deep learning training costs by identifying an informative data subset based on the information extracted by an information extractor (IE). Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels. Motivated by these finding, we propose RAM-APL (RAnking Mean-Accuracy of Pseudo-class Labels), a method tailored for fine-grained image datasets. RAM-APL leverages multiple FMs to enhance subset selection by exploiting their complementary strengths. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained datasets, including Oxford-IIIT Pet, Food-101, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011.

Abstract: In linear contextual bandits, the objective is to select actions that maximize cumulative rewards, modeled as a linear function with unknown parameters. Although Thompson Sampling performs well empirically, it does not achieve optimal regret bounds. This paper proposes a nearly minimax optimal Thompson Sampling for linear contextual bandits by developing a novel estimator with the adaptive augmentation and coupling of the hypothetical samples that are designed for efficient parameter learning. The proposed estimator accurately predicts rewards for all arms without relying on assumptions for the context distribution. Empirical results show robust performance and significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in high-accuracy protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have established receptor-based molecule design as a critical driver for rapid early-phase drug discovery. However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for foundation models. Recent work has highlighted an inherent asymmetry in the initialization of LoRA's low-rank factors, which has been present since its inception and was presumably derived experimentally. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question. We address this by investigating the concentration of the typical LoRA generalization gap around its mean. Our main upper bound reveals a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$ with high probability for rank $r$ LoRAs trained on $N$ samples. Additionally, we also determine the fundamental limits in terms of sample efficiency, establishing a matching lower bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$. By more closely reflecting the practical scenario of a single fine-tuning run, our findings offer crucial insights into the reliability and practicality of asymmetric LoRA.

<title>Risk Estimation of Knee Osteoarthritis Progression via Predictive Multi-task Modelling from Efficient Diffusion Model using X-ray Images</title>

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in assessing knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk by enabling early detection and disease monitoring. Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve. Applied to the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, our approach improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2\%, achieving an AUC of 0.71 in predicting knee OA progression while offering ~9% faster inference time.

<title>AlphaDecay:Module-wise Weight Decay for Heavy-Tailed Balancing in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We show the security risk associated with using machine learning classifiers in United States election tabulators. The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.
  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches, but they require many sampling steps. Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks. Finally, we show text-to-image flow map models that outperform all existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis.

Abstract: This work addresses image restoration tasks through the lens of inverse problems using unpaired datasets. In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.

Abstract: The hardware ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with increasing interest in translating low-level programs across different instruction set architectures (ISAs) in a quick, flexible, and correct way to enhance the portability and longevity of existing code. A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

Abstract: In AI research and practice, rigor remains largely understood in terms of methodological rigor -- such as whether mathematical, statistical, or computational methods are correctly applied. We argue that this narrow conception of rigor has contributed to the concerns raised by the responsible AI community, including overblown claims about AI capabilities. Our position is that a broader conception of what rigorous AI research and practice should entail is needed. We believe such a conception -- in addition to a more expansive understanding of (1) methodological rigor -- should include aspects related to (2) what background knowledge informs what to work on (epistemic rigor); (3) how disciplinary, community, or personal norms, standards, or beliefs influence the work (normative rigor); (4) how clearly articulated the theoretical constructs under use are (conceptual rigor); (5) what is reported and how (reporting rigor); and (6) how well-supported the inferences from existing evidence are (interpretative rigor). In doing so, we also aim to provide useful language and a framework for much-needed dialogue about the AI community's work by researchers, policymakers, journalists, and other stakeholders.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.

We prove a new sample complexity bound using a novel symmetrization technique that may be of independent interest. Additionally, we present applications of our result to $k$-means clustering with unbounded inputs and linear regression with general losses, improving upon existing works.

Abstract: One of the most profound challenges of modern machine learning is performing well on the long-tail of rare and underrepresented features. Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: "Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. We also observe relative lifts of up to 14.1% on underrepresented tasks like CodeRepair and absolute improvements of 35.3% on length instruction following evaluations.

Abstract: Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.

<title>Markov Regime-Switching Intelligent Driver Model for Interpretable Car-Following Behavior</title>

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable car-following models are essential for traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle development. However, classical models like the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their parsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal nature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative speed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model to average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its parameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a regime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by different IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral mode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable behavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We instantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM dynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes (e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic scenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent latent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition dynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset demonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving, effectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic conditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns. This framework provides a tractable and principled solution to modeling context-dependent driving behavior under uncertainty, offering improvements in the fidelity of traffic simulations, the efficacy of safety analyses, and the development of more human-centric ADAS.

Abstract: The success of large language models in text processing has inspired their adaptation to speech modeling. However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters. Code, samples and models are available at https://github.com/b04901014/vae-gslm.

Abstract: The non-convexity of the artificial neural network (ANN) training landscape brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs. However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic. The second algorithm, based on the "sampled convex programs" theory, solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to more sophisticated architectures.

Abstract: A primary requirement for any reinforcement learning method is that it should produce policies that improve upon the initial guess. In this work, we show that the widely used Deep Q-Network (DQN) fails to satisfy this minimal criterion -- even when it gets to see all possible states and actions infinitely often (a condition under which tabular Q-learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal Q-value function). Our specific contributions are twofold. First, we numerically show that DQN often returns a policy that performs worse than the initial one. Second, we offer a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon in linear DQN, a simplified version of DQN that uses linear function approximation in place of neural networks while retaining the other key components such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration, experience replay, and target network. Using tools from differential inclusion theory, we prove that the limit points of linear DQN correspond to fixed points of projected Bellman operators. Crucially, we show that these fixed points need not relate to optimal -- or even near-optimal -- policies, thus explaining linear DQN's sub-optimal behaviors. We also give a scenario where linear DQN always identifies the worst policy. Our work fills a longstanding gap in understanding the convergence behaviors of Q-learning with function approximation and $\epsilon$-greedy exploration.

Abstract: Mixed sample data augmentation strategies are actively used when training deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent studies suggest that they are effective at various tasks. However, the impact of mixed sample data augmentation on model interpretability has not been widely studied. In this paper, we explore the relationship between model interpretability and mixed sample data augmentation, specifically in terms of feature attribution maps. To this end, we introduce a new metric that allows a comparison of model interpretability while minimizing the impact of occlusion robustness of the model. Experimental results show that several mixed sample data augmentation decreases the interpretability of the model and label mixing during data augmentation plays a significant role in this effect. This new finding suggests it is important to carefully adopt the mixed sample data augmentation method, particularly in applications where attribution map-based interpretability is important.

Abstract: Constructing decision trees online is a classical machine learning problem. Existing works often assume that features are readily available for each incoming data point. However, in many real world applications, both feature values and the labels are unknown a priori and can only be obtained at a cost. For example, in medical diagnosis, doctors have to choose which tests to perform (i.e., making costly feature queries) on a patient in order to make a diagnosis decision (i.e., predicting labels). We provide a fresh perspective to tackle this practical challenge. Our framework consists of an active planning oracle embedded in an online learning scheme for which we investigate several information acquisition functions. Specifically, we employ a surrogate information acquisition function based on adaptive submodularity to actively query feature values with a minimal cost, while using a posterior sampling scheme to maintain a low regret for online prediction. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework via extensive experiments on various real-world datasets. Our framework also naturally adapts to the challenging setting of online learning with concept drift and is shown to be competitive with baseline models while being more flexible.

Abstract: The training of neural networks requires tedious and often manual tuning of the network architecture. We propose a systematic approach to inserting new layers during the training process. Our method eliminates the need to choose a fixed network size before training, is numerically inexpensive to execute and applicable to various architectures including fully connected feedforward networks, ResNets and CNNs. Our technique borrows ideas from constrained optimization and is based on first-order sensitivity information of the loss function with respect to the virtual parameters that additional layers, if inserted, would offer. In numerical experiments, our proposed sensitivity-based layer insertion technique (SensLI) exhibits improved performance on training loss and test error, compared to training on a fixed architecture, and reduced computational effort in comparison to training the extended architecture from the beginning. Our code is available on https://github.com/mathemml/SensLI.

Abstract: In games like chess, strategy evolves dramatically across distinct phases - the opening, middlegame, and endgame each demand different forms of reasoning and decision-making. Yet, many modern chess engines rely on a single neural network to play the entire game uniformly, often missing opportunities to specialize. In this work, we introduce M2CTS, a modular framework that combines Mixture of Experts with Monte Carlo Tree Search to adapt strategy dynamically based on game phase. We explore three different methods for training the neural networks: Separated Learning, Staged Learning, and Weighted Learning. By routing decisions through specialized neural networks trained for each phase, M2CTS improves both computational efficiency and playing strength. In experiments on chess, M2CTS achieves up to +122 Elo over standard single-model baselines and shows promising generalization to multi-agent domains such as Pommerman. These results highlight how modular, phase-aware systems can better align with the structured nature of games and move us closer to human-like behavior in dividing a problem into many smaller units.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration requires the ability to learn personalized concepts from a limited number of demonstrations, while exhibiting inductive generalization, hierarchical composition, and adaptability to novel constraints. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to \emph{a-priori} unseen complex concepts. Neuro-symbolic methods (Grand et al., 2023) offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) {\it Sketch:} detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) {\it Plan:} performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) {\it Generalize:} abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-\'a-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches. Further, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.

Abstract: Exploring noise distributions beyond Gaussian in diffusion models remains an open challenge. While Gaussian-based models succeed within a unified SDE framework, recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed noise distributions, like $\alpha$-stable distributions, may better handle mode collapse and effectively manage datasets exhibiting class imbalance, heavy tails, or prominent outliers. Recently, Yoon et al.\ (NeurIPS 2023), presented the L\'evy-It\^o model (LIM), directly extending the SDE-based framework to a class of heavy-tailed SDEs, where the injected noise followed an $\alpha$-stable distribution, a rich class of heavy-tailed distributions. However, the LIM framework relies on highly involved mathematical techniques with limited flexibility, potentially hindering broader adoption and further development. In this study, instead of starting from the SDE formulation, we extend the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) by replacing the Gaussian noise with $\alpha$-stable noise. By using only elementary proof techniques, the proposed approach, Denoising L\'evy Probabilistic Models (DLPM), boils down to vanilla DDPM with minor modifications. As opposed to the Gaussian case, DLPM and LIM yield different training algorithms and different backward processes, leading to distinct sampling algorithms. These fundamental differences translate favorably for DLPM as compared to LIM: our experiments show improvements in coverage of data distribution tails, better robustness to unbalanced datasets, and improved computation times requiring smaller number of backward steps.

Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled fast inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional electromagnetic surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of spectrum and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we define spectral consistency as the property by which the spatial frequency structure of wavelength-dependent condition embeddings matches that of the target electromagnetic field patterns. In addition, we propose two complementary components: a refined wave prior, which is the condition embedding that satisfies spectral consistency, and Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding (WIME), which integrates these embeddings throughout the model while preserving spectral consistency. This framework enables accurate field prediction across the broadband spectrum, including untrained intermediate wavelengths. Our approach reduces the normalized mean squared error at untrained wavelengths by up to 71% compared to the state-of-the-art electromagnetic surrogate solver and achieves a speedup of over 42 times relative to conventional numerical simulations.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for perturbation response modeling in single cells, aimed at standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. Our approach includes a modular and user-friendly model development and evaluation platform, a collection of diverse perturbational datasets, and a set of metrics designed to fairly compare models and dissect their performance nuances. Through extensive evaluation of both published and baseline models across diverse datasets, we highlight the limitations of widely used models, such as mode collapse. We also demonstrate the importance of rank metrics which complement traditional model fit measures, such as RMSE, for validating model effectiveness. Notably, our results show that while no single model architecture clearly outperforms others, simpler architectures are generally competitive and scale well with larger datasets. Overall, this benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances the potential of these models to use high-throughput genetic and chemical screens for disease target discovery.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to solve the Schr\"odinger equation in configuration space. Traditional Configuration Interaction (CI) methods construct the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinants, but this becomes computationally expensive due to the factorial growth in the number of configurations. Our approach extends the use of a generative model such as the RBM by incorporating a taboo list strategy to enhance efficiency and convergence. The RBM is used to efficiently identify and sample the most significant determinants, thus accelerating convergence and substantially reducing computational cost. This method achieves up to 99.99% of the correlation energy while using up to four orders of magnitude fewer determinants compared to full CI calculations and up to two orders of magnitude fewer than previous state of the art methods. Beyond efficiency, our analysis reveals that the RBM learns electron distributions over molecular orbitals by capturing quantum patterns that resemble Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) linked to molecular bonding. This suggests that the learned pattern is interpretable, highlighting the potential of machine learning for explainable quantum chemistry

Abstract: Comparing datasets is a fundamental task in machine learning, essential for various learning paradigms-from evaluating train and test datasets for model generalization to using dataset similarity for detecting data drift. While traditional notions of dataset distances offer principled measures of similarity, their utility has largely been assessed through prediction error minimization. However, in Predict-then-Optimize (PtO) frameworks, where predictions serve as inputs for downstream optimization tasks, model performance is measured through decision regret rather than prediction error. In this work, we propose OTD$^3$ (Optimal Transport Decision-aware Dataset Distance), a novel dataset distance that incorporates downstream decisions in addition to features and labels. We show that traditional feature-label distances lack informativeness in PtO settings, while OTD$^3$ more effectively captures adaptation success. We also derive a PtO-specific adaptation bound based on this distance. Empirically, we show that our proposed distance accurately predicts model transferability across three different PtO tasks from the literature. The code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/OTD3.

Abstract: Designing biological sequences with desired properties is challenging due to vast search spaces and limited evaluation budgets. Although reinforcement learning methods use proxy models for rapid reward evaluation, insufficient training data can cause proxy misspecification on out-of-distribution inputs. To address this, we propose a novel off-policy search, $\delta$-Conservative Search, that enhances robustness by restricting policy exploration to reliable regions. Starting from high-score offline sequences, we inject noise by randomly masking tokens with probability $\delta$, then denoise them using our policy. We further adapt $\delta$ based on proxy uncertainty on each data point, aligning the level of conservativeness with model confidence. Experimental results show that our conservative search consistently enhances the off-policy training, outperforming existing machine learning methods in discovering high-score sequences across diverse tasks, including DNA, RNA, protein, and peptide design.

Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.

Abstract: This document is a replication of the original "Rank-N-Contrast" (arXiv:2210.01189v2) paper published in 2023. This evaluation is done for academic purposes. Deep regression models often fail to capture the continuous nature of sample orders, creating fragmented representations and suboptimal performance. To address this, we reproduced the Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) framework, which learns continuous representations by contrasting samples by their rankings in the target space. Our study validates RNC's theoretical and empirical benefits, including improved performance and robustness. We extended the evaluation to an additional regression dataset and conducted robustness tests using a holdout method, where a specific range of continuous data was excluded from the training set. This approach assessed the model's ability to generalise to unseen data and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This replication study validates the original findings and broadens the understanding of RNC's applicability and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-label node classification is an important yet under-explored domain in graph mining as many real-world nodes belong to multiple categories rather than just a single one. Although a few efforts have been made by utilizing Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) to learn node representations and model correlations between multiple labels in the embedding space, they still suffer from the ambiguous feature and ambiguous topology induced by multiple labels, which reduces the credibility of the messages delivered in graphs and overlooks the label correlations on graph data. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the ambiguity and empower the GCNs for accurate classification. However, this is quite challenging due to the requirement of retaining the distinctiveness of each label while fully harnessing the correlation between labels simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Correlation-aware Graph Convolutional Network (CorGCN) for multi-label node classification. By introducing a novel Correlation-Aware Graph Decomposition module, CorGCN can learn a graph that contains rich label-correlated information for each label. It then employs a Correlation-Enhanced Graph Convolution to model the relationships between labels during message passing to further bolster the classification process. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CorGCN.

Abstract: Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.
  The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate, actionable climate information at km scales is crucial for robust natural hazard risk assessment and infrastructure planning. Simulating climate at these resolutions remains intractable, forcing reliance on downscaling: either physics-based or statistical methods that transform climate simulations from coarse to impact-relevant resolutions. One major challenge for downscaling is to comprehensively capture the interdependency among climate processes of interest, a prerequisite for representing climate hazards. However, current approaches either lack the desired scalability or are bespoke to specific types of hazards. We introduce GenFocal, a computationally efficient, general-purpose, end-to-end generative framework that gives rise to full probabilistic characterizations of complex climate processes interacting at fine spatiotemporal scales. GenFocal more accurately assesses extreme risk in the current climate than leading approaches, including one used in the US 5th National Climate Assessment. It produces plausible tracks of tropical cyclones, providing accurate statistics of their genesis and evolution, even when they are absent from the corresponding climate simulations. GenFocal also shows compelling results that are consistent with the literature on projecting climate impact on decadal timescales. GenFocal revolutionizes how climate simulations can be efficiently augmented with observations and harnessed to enable future climate impact assessments at the spatiotemporal scales relevant to local and regional communities. We believe this work establishes genAI as an effective paradigm for modeling complex, high-dimensional multivariate statistical correlations that have deterred precise quantification of climate risks associated with hazards such as wildfires, extreme heat, tropical cyclones, and flooding; thereby enabling the evaluation of adaptation strategies.

Abstract: We introduce a method based on Conformal Prediction (CP) to quantify the uncertainty of full ranking algorithms. We focus on a specific scenario where $n+m$ items are to be ranked by some ``black box'' algorithm. It is assumed that the relative (ground truth) ranking of $n$ of them is known. The objective is then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new items among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$ original items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the $m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to apply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct distribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results on the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we provide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item. We also control the false coverage proportion, a crucial quantity when dealing with multiple prediction sets. Finally, we empirically show on both synthetic and real data the efficiency of our CP method for state-of-the-art algorithms such as RankNet or LambdaMart.

Abstract: Efficient sampling of unnormalized probability densities such as the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is a longstanding challenge. Next to conventional approaches like molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational approaches, such as training normalizing flows with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, have been introduced. However, such methods are prone to mode collapse and often do not learn to sample the full configurational space. Here, we present temperature-annealed Boltzmann generators (TA-BG) to address this challenge. First, we demonstrate that training a normalizing flow with the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence at high temperatures is possible without mode collapse. Furthermore, we introduce a reweighting-based training objective to anneal the distribution to lower target temperatures. We apply this methodology to three molecular systems of increasing complexity and, compared to the baseline, achieve better results in almost all metrics while requiring up to three times fewer target energy evaluations. For the largest system, our approach is the only method that accurately resolves the metastable states of the system.

Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning (RL) assumes that an agent can observe a reward for each state-action pair. However, in practical applications, it is often difficult and costly to collect a reward for each state-action pair. While there have been several works considering RL with trajectory feedback, it is unclear if trajectory feedback is inefficient for learning when trajectories are long. In this work, we consider a model named RL with segment feedback, which offers a general paradigm filling the gap between per-state-action feedback and trajectory feedback. In this model, we consider an episodic Markov decision process (MDP), where each episode is divided into $m$ segments, and the agent observes reward feedback only at the end of each segment. Under this model, we study two popular feedback settings: binary feedback and sum feedback, where the agent observes a binary outcome and a reward sum according to the underlying reward function, respectively. To investigate the impact of the number of segments $m$ on learning performance, we design efficient algorithms and establish regret upper and lower bounds for both feedback settings. Our theoretical and experimental results show that: under binary feedback, increasing the number of segments $m$ decreases the regret at an exponential rate; in contrast, surprisingly, under sum feedback, increasing $m$ does not reduce the regret significantly.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed various manifestations of position bias in transformer architectures, from the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon to attention sinks, yet a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how attention masks and positional encodings shape these biases remains elusive. This paper presents a graph-theoretic framework for analyzing position bias in multi-layer attention. Modeling attention masks as directed graphs, we quantify how tokens interact with contextual information based on their sequential positions. We uncover two key insights: First, causal masking inherently biases attention toward earlier positions, as tokens in deeper layers attend to increasingly more contextualized representations of earlier tokens. Second, we characterize the competing effects of the causal mask and relative positional encodings, such as the decay mask and rotary positional encoding (RoPE): while both mechanisms introduce distance-based decay within individual attention maps, their aggregate effect across multiple attention layers$\unicode{x2013}$coupled with the causal mask$\unicode{x2013}$leads to a trade-off between the long-term decay effects and the cumulative importance of early sequence positions. Through controlled numerical experiments, we not only validate our theoretical findings but also reproduce position biases observed in real-world LLMs. Our framework offers a principled foundation for understanding positional biases in transformers, shedding light on the complex interplay of attention mechanism components and guiding more informed architectural design.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models excel at detecting individual actions, objects, or scene attributes from short, local observations. However, many real-world tasks, such as in smart cities and healthcare, require reasoning over complex events (CEs): (spatio)temporal, rule-governed patterns of short-term atomic events (AEs) that reflect high-level understanding and critical changes in the environment. These CEs are difficult to detect online: they are often rare, require long-range reasoning over noisy sensor data, must generalize rules beyond fixed-length traces, and suffer from limited real-world datasets due to the high annotation burden. We propose NAROCE, a Neural Algorithmic Reasoning framework for Online CE detection that separates the task into two stages: (i) learning CE rules from large-scale, low-cost pseudo AE concept traces generated by simulators or LLMs, and (ii) training an adapter to map real sensor data into the learned reasoning space using fewer labeled sensor samples. Experiments show that NAROCE outperforms the strongest baseline in accuracy, generalization to longer, unseen sequences, and data efficiency, achieving comparable performance with less than half the labeled data. These results suggest that decoupling CE rule learning from raw sensor inputs improves both data efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: In domains such as molecular and protein generation, physical systems exhibit inherent symmetries that are critical to model. Two main strategies have emerged for learning invariant distributions: designing equivariant network architectures and using data augmentation to approximate equivariance. While equivariant architectures preserve symmetry by design, they often involve greater complexity and pose optimization challenges. Data augmentation, on the other hand, offers flexibility but may fall short in fully capturing symmetries. Our framework enhances both approaches by reducing training variance and providing a provably lower-variance gradient estimator. We achieve this by interpreting data augmentation as a Monte Carlo estimator of the training gradient and applying Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable optimization, faster convergence, and reduced variance, all while requiring only a single forward and backward pass per sample. We also present a practical implementation of this estimator incorporating the loss and sampling procedure through a method we call Orbit Diffusion. Theoretically, we guarantee that our loss admits equivariant minimizers. Empirically, Orbit Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art results on GEOM-QM9 for molecular conformation generation, improves crystal structure prediction, and advances text-guided crystal generation on the Perov-5 and MP-20 benchmarks. Additionally, it enhances protein designability in protein structure generation.

Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a family of computational methods that derive near-optimal geometries from formal problem descriptions. Despite their success, established TO methods are limited to generating single solutions, restricting the exploration of alternative designs. To address this limitation, we introduce Topology Optimization using Modulated Neural Fields (TOM) - a data-free method that trains a neural network to generate structurally compliant shapes and explores diverse solutions through an explicit diversity constraint. The network is trained with a solver-in-the-loop, optimizing the material distribution in each iteration. The trained model produces diverse shapes that closely adhere to the design requirements. We validate TOM on 2D and 3D TO problems. Our results show that TOM generates more diverse solutions than any previous method, all while maintaining near-optimality and without relying on a dataset. These findings open new avenues for engineering and design, offering enhanced flexibility and innovation in structural optimization.

Abstract: We examine theoretical properties of the denoising score matching estimate. We model the density of observations with a nonparametric Gaussian mixture. We significantly relax the standard manifold assumption allowing the samples step away from the manifold. At the same time, we are still able to leverage a nice distribution structure. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the approximation and generalization errors of the denoising score matching estimate. The rates of convergence are determined by the intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, our bounds remain valid even if we allow the ambient dimension grow polynomially with the sample size.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting high-quality data significantly boosts analytical accuracy and efficiency, the exact process is very challenging given large-scale dataset availability. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from the available datasets. Each dataset is transformed to a vector embedding representation generated by our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, where similarity search are employed. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately, and increases speedup. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation accurately and distinguish them.

Abstract: With the integration of image modality, the semantic space of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is more complex than text-only models, making their interpretability more challenging and their alignment less stable, particularly susceptible to low-quality data, which can lead to inconsistencies between modalities, hallucinations, and biased outputs. As a result, developing interpretability methods for MLLMs is crucial for improving alignment quality and efficiency. In text-only LLMs, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained attention for their ability to interpret latent representations. However, extending SAEs to multimodal settings presents new challenges due to modality fusion and the difficulty of isolating cross-modal representations. To address these challenges, we introduce SAE-V, a mechanistic interpretability framework that extends the SAE paradigm to MLLMs. By identifying and analyzing interpretable features along with their corresponding data, SAE-V enables fine-grained interpretation of both model behavior and data quality, facilitating a deeper understanding of cross-modal interactions and alignment dynamics. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal feature weighting, SAE-V provides an intrinsic data filtering mechanism to enhance model alignment without requiring additional models. Specifically, when applied to the alignment process of MLLMs, SAE-V-based data filtering methods could achieve more than 110% performance with less than 50% data. Our results highlight SAE-V's ability to enhance interpretability and alignment in MLLMs, providing insights into their internal mechanisms.

<title>Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to \emph{reward hacking}, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. Although reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests two key design principles: (1) the RL reward should be bounded, and (2) the RL reward benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B, and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate of at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. The code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR, and the Work done during the internship at StepFun by Jiayi Fu.

Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.

Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

Abstract: We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify
  the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating valid and small prediction sets by sampling outputs (e.g., software code and natural language text) from a black-box deep generative model for a given input (e.g., textual prompt). The validity of a prediction set is determined by a user-defined binary admissibility function depending on the target application. For example, requiring at least one program in the set to pass all test cases in code generation application. To address this problem, we develop a simple and effective conformal inference algorithm referred to as Generative Prediction Sets (GPS). Given a set of calibration examples and black-box access to a deep generative model, GPS can generate prediction sets with provable guarantees. The key insight behind GPS is to exploit the inherent structure within the distribution over the minimum number of samples needed to obtain an admissible output to develop a simple conformal regression approach over the minimum number of samples. Experiments on multiple datasets for code and math word problems using different large language models demonstrate the efficacy of GPS over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As modern neural networks get more complex, specifying a model with high predictive performance and sound uncertainty quantification becomes a more challenging task. Despite some promising theoretical results on the true posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian neural networks, the properties of even the most commonly used posterior approximations are often questioned. Computational burdens and intractable posteriors expose miscalibrated Bayesian neural networks to poor accuracy and unreliable uncertainty estimates. Approximate Bayesian inference aims to replace unknown and intractable posterior distributions with some simpler but feasible distributions. The dimensions of modern deep models, coupled with the lack of identifiability, make Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tremendously expensive and unable to fully explore the multimodal posterior. On the other hand, variational inference benefits from improved computational complexity but lacks the asymptotical guarantees of sampling-based inference and tends to concentrate around a single mode. The performance of both approaches heavily depends on architectural choices; this paper aims to shed some light on this by considering the computational costs, accuracy and uncertainty quantification in different scenarios including large width and out-of-sample data. To improve posterior exploration, different model averaging and ensembling techniques are studied, along with their benefits on predictive performance. In our experiments, variational inference overall provided better uncertainty quantification than MCMC; further, stacking and ensembles of variational approximations provided comparable accuracy to MCMC at a much-reduced cost.

Abstract: Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics system identification is crucial for circuit emulation. Traditional continuous-time domain modeling approaches have limitations in fitting capability and computational efficiency when used for modeling circuit IPs and device behaviors.This paper presents a novel continuous-time domain hybrid modeling paradigm. It integrates neural network differential models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), creating NODE-RNN and NCDE-RNN models based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDE), respectively.Theoretical analysis shows that this hybrid model has mathematical advantages in event-driven dynamic mutation response and gradient propagation stability. Validation using real data from PIN diodes in high-power microwave environments shows NCDE-RNN improves fitting accuracy by 33\% over traditional NCDE, and NODE-RNN by 24\% over CTRNN, especially in capturing nonlinear memory effects.The model has been successfully deployed in Verilog-A and validated through circuit emulation, confirming its compatibility with existing platforms and practical value.This hybrid dynamics paradigm, by restructuring the neural differential equation solution path, offers new ideas for high-precision circuit time-domain modeling and is significant for complex nonlinear circuit system modeling.

Abstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of importance weighting in deep neural networks under label shift and covariate shift. On synthetic 2D data (linearly separable and moon-shaped) using logistic regression and MLPs, we observe that weighting strongly affects decision boundaries early in training but fades with prolonged optimization. On CIFAR-10 with various class imbalances, only L2 regularization (not dropout) helps preserve weighting effects. In a covariate-shift experiment, importance weighting yields no significant performance gain, highlighting challenges on complex data. Our results call into question the practical utility of importance weighting for real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: Binary quantization approaches, which replace weight matrices with binary matrices and substitute costly multiplications with cheaper additions, offer a computationally efficient approach to address the increasing computational and storage requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the severe quantization constraint ($\pm1$) can lead to significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Double Binary Factorization (DBF), a novel method that factorizes dense weight matrices into products of two binary (sign) matrices, each accompanied by scaling vectors. DBF preserves the efficiency advantages of binary representations while achieving compression rates that are competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a 1-bit per weight range, DBF is better than existing binarization approaches. In a 2-bit per weight range, DBF is competitive with the best quantization methods like QuIP\# and QTIP. Unlike most existing compression techniques, which offer limited compression level choices, DBF allows fine-grained control over compression ratios by adjusting the factorization's intermediate dimension. Based on this advantage, we further introduce an algorithm for estimating non-uniform layer-wise compression ratios for DBF, based on previously developed channel pruning criteria.

Abstract: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally. Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action Units (AUs) and their interrelationships for pain intensity estimation. AUs are represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain, achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity estimation.

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data. However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

<title>Accelerating RLHF Training with Reward Variance Increase</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 20.7% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) faces significant challenges posed by label noise, especially in multiclass classification tasks. Existing methods either lack mechanisms to handle label noise effectively or suffer from high computational costs due to redundant data usage. Inspired by granular computing, this paper proposes granular adaptive boosting (GAdaBoost), a novel two-stage framework comprising a data granulation stage and an adaptive boosting stage, to enhance efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions. To validate its feasibility, an extension of SAMME, termed GAdaBoost.SA, is proposed. Specifically, first, a granular-ball generation method is designed to compress data while preserving diversity and mitigating label noise. Second, the granular ball-based SAMME algorithm focuses on granular balls rather than individual samples, improving efficiency and reducing sensitivity to noise. Experimental results on some noisy datasets show that the proposed approach achieves superior robustness and efficiency compared with existing methods, demonstrating that this work effectively extends AdaBoost and SAMME.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality. This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally, we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further, while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit downstream model generalization.

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset, potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups. Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems, particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their fair variants.

We introduce MultiNet - a novel, fully open-source benchmark and surrounding software ecosystem designed to rigorously evaluate and adapt models across vision, language, and action domains. We establish standardized evaluation protocols for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), and provide open source software to download relevant data, models, and evaluations. Additionally, we provide a composite dataset with over 1.3 trillion tokens of image captioning, visual question answering, commonsense reasoning, robotic control, digital game-play, simulated locomotion/manipulation, and many more tasks. The MultiNet benchmark, framework, toolkit, and evaluation harness have been used in downstream research on the limitations of VLA generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs. While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs, they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work, we first propose dual-state linear attention (DSLA), a novel design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive distillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. DSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x faster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies, addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Abstract: We construct multiperiodic processes -- a simple example of stationary ergodic stochastic processes over natural numbers that enjoy the vanishing entropy rate under a mild condition. Multiperiodic processes are supported on randomly shifted deterministic sequences called multiperiodic sequences, which can be efficiently generated using an algorithm called the Infinite Clock. Under a suitable parameterization, multiperiodic sequences exhibit relative frequencies of particular numbers given by Zipf's law. Exactly in the same setting, the respective multiperiodic processes satisfy an asymptotic power-law growth of block entropy, called Hilberg's law. Hilberg's law is deemed to hold for statistical language models, in particular.

Abstract: The most effective domain adaptation (DA) technique involves the decomposition of data representation into a domain-independent representation (DIRep) and a domain-dependent representation (DDRep). A classifier is trained by using the DIRep on the labeled source images. Since the DIRep is domain invariant, the classifier can be "transferred" to make predictions for the target domain with no (or few) labels. However, information useful for classification in the target domain can "hide" in the DDRep. Current DA algorithms, such as Domain-Separation Networks (DSN), do not adequately address this issue. DSN's weak constraint to enforce the orthogonality of DIRep and DDRep allows this hiding effect and can result in poor performance. To address this shortcoming, we develop a new algorithm wherein a stronger constraint is imposed to minimize the information content in DDRep to create a DIRep that retains relevant information about the target labels and, in turn, results in a better invariant representation. By using synthetic datasets, we show explicitly that depending on the initialization, DSN, with its weaker constraint, can lead to sub-optimal solutions with poorer DA performance. In contrast, our algorithm is robust against such perturbations. We demonstrate the equal-or-better performance of our approach against DSN and other recent DA methods by using several standard benchmark image datasets. We further highlight the compatibility of our algorithm with pre-trained models for classifying real-world images and showcase its adaptability and versatility through its application in network intrusion detection.

Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient alternative to generalized random forests (GRFs) for estimating heterogeneous effects in large dimensions. While GRFs rely on a gradient-based splitting criterion, which in large dimensions is computationally expensive and unstable, our method introduces a fixed-point approximation that eliminates the need for Jacobian estimation. This gradient-free approach preserves GRF's theoretical guarantees of consistency and asymptotic normality while significantly improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate that our method achieves a speedup of multiple times over standard GRFs without compromising statistical accuracy. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data validate our approach. Our findings suggest that the proposed method is a scalable alternative for localized effect estimation in machine learning and causal inference applications

Abstract: Captions are crucial for understanding scientific visualizations and documents. Existing captioning methods for scientific figures rely on figure-caption pairs extracted from documents for training, many of which fall short with respect to metrics like helpfulness, explainability, and visual-descriptiveness [15] leading to generated captions being misaligned with reader preferences. To enable the generation of high-quality figure captions, we introduce FigCaps-HF a new framework for figure-caption generation that can incorporate domain expert feedback in generating captions optimized for reader preferences. Our framework comprises of 1) an automatic method for evaluating quality of figure-caption pairs, 2) a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) method to optimize a generative figure-to-caption model for reader preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our simple learning framework by improving performance over standard fine-tuning across different types of models. In particular, when using BLIP as the base model, our RLHF framework achieves a mean gain of 35.7%, 16.9%, and 9% in ROUGE, BLEU, and Meteor, respectively. Finally, we release a large-scale benchmark dataset with human feedback on figure-caption pairs to enable further evaluation and development of RLHF techniques for this problem.

Abstract: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) faces increasing environmental scrutiny, particularly concerning the energy consumption of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. However, existing systematic literature reviews of DLT rely on limited analyses of citations, abstracts, and keywords, failing to fully capture the field's complexity and ESG concerns. We address these challenges by analyzing the full text of 24,539 publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with our manually labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset of 39,427 entities for DLT. This methodology identified 505 key publications at the DLT/ESG intersection, enabling comprehensive domain analysis. Our combined NLP and temporal graph analysis reveals critical trends in DLT evolution and ESG impacts, including cryptography and peer-to-peer networks research's foundational influence, Bitcoin's persistent impact on research and environmental concerns (a "Lindy effect"), Ethereum's catalytic role on Proof of Stake (PoS) and smart contract adoption, and the industry's progressive shift toward energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Our contributions include the first DLT-specific NER dataset addressing the scarcity of high-quality labeled NLP data in blockchain research, a methodology integrating NLP and temporal graph analysis for large-scale interdisciplinary literature reviews, and the first NLP-driven literature review focusing on DLT's ESG aspects.

<title>Strategic Client Selection to Address Non-IIDness in HAPS-enabled FL Networks</title>

Abstract: The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.

Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.

Abstract: Despite being a key bottleneck in many machine learning tasks, the cost of solving large linear systems has proven challenging to quantify due to problem-dependent quantities such as condition numbers. To tackle this, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for solving linear systems, which is motivated by applications where the data exhibits low-dimensional structure, including spiked covariance models and kernel machines, and when the linear system is explicitly regularized, such as ridge regression. Concretely, let $\kappa_\ell$ be the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of $n\times n$ matrix $A$. We give a stochastic algorithm based on the Sketch-and-Project paradigm, that solves the linear system $Ax = b$, that is, finds $\bar{x}$ such that $\|A\bar{x} - b\| \le \epsilon \|b\|$, in time $\bar O(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$, for any $\ell = O(n^{0.729})$. This is a direct improvement over preconditioned conjugate gradient, and it provides a stronger separation between stochastic linear solvers and algorithms accessing $A$ only through matrix-vector products. Our main technical contribution is the new analysis of the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that arises in Sketch-and-Project.

Abstract: Proactive content moderation requires platforms to rapidly and continuously evaluate the credibility of websites. Leveraging the direct and indirect paths users follow to unreliable websites, we develop a website credibility classification and discovery system that integrates both webgraph and large-scale social media contexts. We additionally introduce the concept of dredge words, terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly on search engines, and provide the first exploration of their usage on social media. Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.

<title>Flat Posterior Does Matter For Bayesian Model Averaging</title>

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and utilize posterior samples for Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in prediction. However, despite the crucial role of flatness in the loss landscape in improving the generalization of neural networks, its impact on BMA has been largely overlooked. In this work, we explore how posterior flatness influences BMA generalization and empirically demonstrate that (1) most approximate Bayesian inference methods fail to yield a flat posterior and (2) BMA predictions, without considering posterior flatness, are less effective at improving generalization. To address this, we propose Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Model Averaging (FP-BMA), a novel training objective that explicitly encourages flat posteriors in a principled Bayesian manner. We also introduce a Flat Posterior-aware Bayesian Transfer Learning scheme that enhances generalization in downstream tasks. Empirically, we show that FP-BMA successfully captures flat posteriors, improving generalization performance.

<title>QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE</title>

Abstract: Alpha factor mining aims to discover investment signals from the historical financial market data, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Powerful deep learning methods for alpha factor mining lack interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Formulaic alpha factors are preferred for their interpretability, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. REINFORCE employs Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the policy gradient-yielding unbiased but high variance estimates. The minimal environmental variability inherent in the underlying state transition function, which adheres to the Dirac distribution, can help alleviate this high variance issue, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Evaluations on real assets data indicate the proposed algorithm boosts correlation with returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.

<title>Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/MSLDMDemo/.

Abstract: Recent advances (Sherman, 2017; Sidford and Tian, 2018; Cohen et al., 2021) have overcome the fundamental barrier of dimension dependence in the iteration complexity of solving $\ell_\infty$ regression with first-order methods. Yet it remains unclear to what extent such acceleration can be achieved for general $\ell_p$ smooth functions. In this paper, we propose a new accelerated first-order method for convex optimization under non-Euclidean smoothness assumptions. In contrast to standard acceleration techniques, our approach uses primal-dual iterate sequences taken with respect to $\textit{differing}$ norms, which are then coupled using an $\textit{implicitly}$ determined interpolation parameter. For $\ell_p$ norm smooth problems in $d$ dimensions, our method provides an iteration complexity improvement of up to $O(d^{1-\frac{2}{p}})$ in terms of calls to a first-order oracle, thereby allowing us to circumvent long-standing barriers in accelerated non-Euclidean steepest descent.

<title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>

Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.

Abstract: Cells in multicellular organisms coordinate to form functional and structural niches. With spatial transcriptomics enabling gene expression profiling in spatial contexts, it has been revealed that spatial niches serve as cohesive and recurrent units in physiological and pathological processes. These observations suggest universal tissue organization principles encoded by conserved niche patterns, and call for a query-based niche analytical paradigm beyond current computational tools. In this work, we defined the Niche Query Task, which is to identify similar niches across ST samples given a niche of interest (NOI). We further developed QueST, a specialized method for solving this task. QueST models each niche as a subgraph, uses contrastive learning to learn discriminative niche embeddings, and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. In simulations and benchmark datasets, QueST outperformed existing methods repurposed for niche querying, accurately capturing niche structures in heterogeneous environments and demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse sequencing platforms. Applied to tertiary lymphoid structures in renal and lung cancers, QueST revealed functionally distinct niches associated with patient prognosis and uncovered conserved and divergent spatial architectures across cancer types. These results demonstrate that QueST enables systematic, quantitative profiling of spatial niches across samples, providing a powerful tool to dissect spatial tissue architecture in health and disease.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) solutions with central Differential Privacy (DP) have seen large improvements in their utility in recent years arising from the matrix mechanism, while FL solutions with distributed (more private) DP have lagged behind. In this work, we introduce the distributed matrix mechanism to achieve the best-of-both-worlds; better privacy of distributed DP and better utility from the matrix mechanism. We accomplish this using a novel cryptographic protocol that securely transfers sensitive values across client committees of different training iterations with constant communication overhead. This protocol accommodates the dynamic participation of users required by FL, including those that may drop out from the computation. We provide experiments which show that our mechanism indeed significantly improves the utility of FL models compared to previous distributed DP mechanisms, with little added overhead.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation has become a prominent task in natural language processing due to the rise of powerful (large) language models. However, evaluating the quality of these models and the employed decoding strategies remains challenging due to trade-offs among widely used metrics such as coherence, diversity, and perplexity. This paper addresses the specific problem of multicriteria evaluation for open-ended text generation, proposing novel methods for both relative and absolute rankings of decoding methods. Specifically, we employ benchmarking approaches based on partial orderings and present a new summary metric to balance existing automatic indicators, providing a more holistic evaluation of text generation quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches offer a robust way to compare decoding strategies and serve as valuable tools to guide model selection for open-ended text generation tasks. We suggest future directions for improving evaluation methodologies in text generation and make our code, datasets, and models publicly available.

Abstract: Despite the dominant role of deep models in machine learning, limitations persist, including overconfident predictions, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and underestimation of variability in predictions. The Bayesian paradigm provides a natural framework to overcome such issues and has become the gold standard for uncertainty estimation with deep models, also providing improved accuracy and a framework for tuning critical hyperparameters. However, exact Bayesian inference is challenging, typically involving variational algorithms that impose strong independence and distributional assumptions. Moreover, existing methods are sensitive to the architectural choice of the network. We address these issues by focusing on a stochastic relaxation of the standard feed-forward rectified neural network and using sparsity-promoting priors on the weights of the neural network for increased robustness to architectural design. Thanks to Polya-Gamma data augmentation tricks, which render a conditionally linear and Gaussian model, we derive a fast, approximate variational inference algorithm that avoids distributional assumptions and independence across layers. Suitable strategies to further improve scalability and account for multimodality are considered.

<title>Market Making without Regret</title>

arXiv:2411.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round $t$, a market maker posts a bid price $B_t$ and an ask price $A_t$ to an incoming trader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset. If the trader's valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price, then a trade (sell or buy) occurs. If a trade happens at round $t$, then letting $M_t$ be the market price (observed only at the end of round $t$), the maker's utility is $M_t - B_t$ if the maker bought the asset, and $A_t - M_t$ if they sold it. We characterize the maker's regret with respect to the best fixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial, i.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations. Our upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market making to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing. Our main technical contribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions and independence between prices and valuations. The difficulty in the analysis stems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing an algorithm to acquire information by graduating the "cost of exploration" in an arbitrary way.

Abstract: Recent advances in language models opened new opportunities to address complex schema matching tasks. Schema matching approaches have been proposed that demonstrate the usefulness of language models, but they have also uncovered important limitations: Small language models (SLMs) require training data (which can be both expensive and challenging to obtain), and large language models (LLMs) often incur high computational costs and must deal with constraints imposed by context windows. We present Magneto, a cost-effective and accurate solution for schema matching that combines the advantages of SLMs and LLMs to address their limitations. By structuring the schema matching pipeline in two phases, retrieval and reranking, Magneto can use computationally efficient SLM-based strategies to derive candidate matches which can then be reranked by LLMs, thus making it possible to reduce runtime without compromising matching accuracy. We propose a self-supervised approach to fine-tune SLMs which uses LLMs to generate syntactically diverse training data, and prompting strategies that are effective for reranking. We also introduce a new benchmark, developed in collaboration with domain experts, which includes real biomedical datasets and presents new challenges to schema matching methods. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, using both our new and existing benchmarks, we show that Magneto is scalable and attains high accuracy for datasets from different domains.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models outperform conventional models by selectively activating different subnets, named \emph{experts}, on a per-token basis. This gated computation generates dynamic communications that cannot be determined beforehand, challenging the existing GPU interconnects that remain \emph{static} during the distributed training process. In this paper, we advocate for a first-of-its-kind system, called mFabric, that unlocks topology reconfiguration \emph{during} distributed MoE training. Towards this vision, we first perform a production measurement study and show that the MoE dynamic communication pattern has \emph{strong locality}, alleviating the requirement of global reconfiguration. Based on this, we design and implement a \emph{regionally reconfigurable high-bandwidth domain} on top of existing electrical interconnects using optical circuit switching (OCS), achieving scalability while maintaining rapid adaptability. We have built a fully functional mFabric prototype with commodity hardware and a customized collective communication runtime that trains state-of-the-art MoE models with \emph{in-training} topology reconfiguration across 32 A100 GPUs. Large-scale packet-level simulations show that mFabric delivers comparable performance as the non-blocking fat-tree fabric while boosting the training cost efficiency (e.g., performance per dollar) of four representative MoE models by 1.2$\times$--1.5$\times$ and 1.9$\times$--2.3$\times$ at 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps link bandwidths, respectively.

Abstract: Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results. To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process. This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage. We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper. We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods. We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, trained on huge amount of datasets spanning multiple domains, exhibit significant reasoning, understanding, and planning capabilities across various tasks. This study presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs), including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates how diffusion generative models leverage (unknown) low-dimensional structure to accelerate sampling. Focusing on two mainstream samplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates, we prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of $k/\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target distributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions. Further, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the coefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in facilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown low-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory regarding total variation convergence.

Abstract: This paper is focused on statistical learning from data that come as probability measures. In this setting, popular approaches consist in embedding such data into a Hilbert space with either Linearized Optimal Transport or Kernel Mean Embedding. However, the cost of computing such embeddings prohibits their direct use in large-scale settings. We study two methods based on measure quantization for approximating input probability measures with discrete measures of small-support size. The first one is based on optimal quantization of each input measure, while the second one relies on mean-measure quantization. We study the consistency of such approximations, and its implication for scalable embeddings of probability measures into a Hilbert space at a low computational cost. We finally illustrate our findings with various numerical experiments.

Abstract: Effective search methods are crucial for improving the performance of deep generative models at test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time search method, Neural Genetic Search (NGS), which incorporates the evolutionary mechanism of genetic algorithms into the generation procedure of deep models. The core idea behind NGS is its crossover, which is defined as parent-conditioned generation using trained generative models. This approach offers a versatile and easy-to-implement search algorithm for deep generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of NGS through experiments across three distinct domains: routing problems, adversarial prompt generation for language models, and molecular design.

Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioral traits. Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in plantar pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, we introduce the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset: a footStep database for gait analysis and recognition using Underfoot Pressure, including data from 150 individuals. This dataset comprises high-resolution plantar pressure data (4 sensors per cm-squared) collected using a 1.2m by 3.6m pressure-sensing walkway. It contains over 200,000 footsteps from participants walking with various speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear conditions (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes), supporting advancements in biometric gait recognition and resenting new research opportunities in biomechanics and deep learning. UNB StepUP-P150 establishes a new benchmark for plantar pressure-based gait analysis and recognition.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates a critical aspect of large language model (LLM) performance: the optimal formatting of classification task options in prompts. Through an extensive experimental study, we compared two selection formats -- bullet points and plain English -- to determine their impact on model performance. Our findings suggest that presenting options via bullet points generally yields better results, although there are some exceptions. Furthermore, our research highlights the need for continued exploration of option formatting to drive further improvements in model performance.

<title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought.

<title>Achieving Unbiased Multi-Instance Learning via Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled Learning</title>

Abstract: In real-world applications, it is often challenging to detect anomalous samples when the anomalous information they contain is extremely limited. In such cases, both macro-level and micro-level detection using multi-instance learning (MIL) encounter significant difficulties. The former struggles because normal and anomalous samples are highly similar and hard to distinguish at the macro level, while the latter is limited by the lack of labels at the micro level. In MIL, micro-level labels are inferred from macro-level labels, which can lead to severe bias. Moreover, the more imbalanced the distribution between normal and anomalous samples, the more pronounced these limitations become. In this study, we observe that the MIL problem can be elegantly transformed into a fine-grained Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem. This transformation allows us to address the imbalance issue in an unbiased manner using a micro-level balancing mechanism. To this end, we propose a novel framework-Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU)-based on rigorous theoretical foundations to address the challenges above. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU, which outperforms existing methods, even in extreme scenarios where both macro and micro-level distributions are highly imbalanced. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/BFGPU/BFGPU.

<title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>

arXiv:2503.16974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.

<title>Mildly-Interacting Fermionic Unitaries are Efficiently Learnable</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11318</link>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that one can efficiently learn fermionic Gaussian unitaries, also commonly known as nearest-neighbor matchcircuits or non-interacting fermionic unitaries. However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.
  We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to an $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.
  In addition, we give a $\textrm{poly}(n,1/\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest.

Abstract: A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to classify T1-weighted brain MRI scans as healthy or Alzheimer. The network comprises 3D convolution, pooling, batch normalization, dense ReLU layers, and a sigmoid output. Using stochastic noise injection and five-fold cross-validation, the model achieved test set accuracy of 0.912 and area under the ROC curve of 0.961, an improvement of approximately 0.027 over resizing alone. Sensitivity and specificity both exceeded 0.90. These results align with prior work reporting up to 0.10 gain via synthetic augmentation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple augmentation for 3D MRI classification and motivate future exploration of advanced augmentation methods and architectures such as 3D U-Net and vision transformers.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in procedurally out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLMs and VLAs - including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA, Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST - on diverse procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by factors such as action representation and task complexity; (2) VLAs generally outperforms other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt engineering. We release our benchmark, evaluation framework, and findings to enable the assessment of future VLA models and identify critical areas for improvement in their application to out-of-distribution digital tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: https://arraydps.github.io/ArrayDPSDemo/.

<title>Spline Dimensional Decomposition with Interpolation-based Optimal Knot Selection for Stochastic Dynamic Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12879</link>

arXiv:2505.12879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forward uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems is challenging due to non-smooth or locally oscillating nonlinear behaviors. Spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning input coordinates via knot placement, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to internal knot locations. Optimizing knots using sequential quadratic programming is effective, yet computationally expensive. We propose a computationally efficient, interpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method includes: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining subinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting knots at maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is then applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and oscillatory responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm shows that SDD with the proposed knots yields higher accuracy than SDD with uniformly or randomly spaced knots and a Gaussian process model. In this example, the proposed SDD achieves the lowest relative variance error (2.89%) for the first natural frequency distribution, compared to uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots (15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%). All surrogates are constructed using the same 401 simulation datasets, and errors are evaluated against a 2000-sample Monte Carlo simulation. Scalability and applicability are demonstrated through stochastic and reliability analyses of one- and three-dimensional benchmark functions, and a ten-dimensional lower control arm model. Results confirm that second-moment statistics and reliability estimates can be accurately obtained with only a few hundred function evaluations or finite element simulations.

<title>Roboflow100-VL: A Multi-Domain Object Detection Benchmark for Vision-Language Models</title>

arXiv:2505.20612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 16.8 mAP!

Abstract: Nowadays, formal theorem provers have made monumental progress on high-school and competition-level mathematics, but few of them generalize to more advanced mathematics. In this paper, we present REAL-Prover, a new open-source stepwise theorem prover for Lean 4 to push this boundary. This prover, based on our fine-tuned large language model (REAL-Prover-v1) and integrated with a retrieval system (Leansearch-PS), notably boosts performance on solving college-level mathematics problems. To train REAL-Prover-v1, we developed HERALD-AF, a data extraction pipeline that converts natural language math problems into formal statements, and a new open-source Lean 4 interactive environment (Jixia-interactive) to facilitate synthesis data collection. In our experiments, our prover using only supervised fine-tune achieves competitive results with a 23.7% success rate (Pass@64) on the ProofNet dataset-comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To further evaluate our approach, we introduce FATE-M, a new benchmark focused on algebraic problems, where our prover achieves a SOTA success rate of 56.7% (Pass@64).

<title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>

arXiv:2505.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

arXiv:2505.23145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

arXiv:2506.00854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

We describe the pre-training data collection and filtering pipeline, including the creation of EuroFilter, an AI-based multilingual filter, as well as the design of EuroBlocks-Synthetic, a novel synthetic dataset for post-training that enhances language coverage for European languages. Evaluation results demonstrate EuroLLM-9B's competitive performance on multilingual benchmarks and machine translation tasks, establishing it as the leading open European-made LLM of its size. To support open research and adoption, we release all major components of this work, including the base and instruction-tuned models, the EuroFilter classifier, and the synthetic post-training dataset.

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19 methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

arXiv:2506.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit "accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds. We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments risk exceeding model output token limits, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

<div> investigate, Large Language Models, robustness, structural interventions, inference<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions during inference. Surprisingly, even after deleting or swapping adjacent layers, the models maintain 72-95% of their initial top-1 prediction accuracy without any further adjustments. The research reveals that the sensitivity to interventions is not consistent across all layers, with the early and final layers experiencing the most significant impact while the middle layers show greater resilience. This observation leads to the identification of four stages of inference in LLMs: detokenization, feature engineering, prediction ensembling, and residual sharpening. These stages highlight how local context is integrated, features are refined, hidden states are aggregated, and irrelevant features are suppressed during the inference process. By combining behavioral and mechanistic evidence, a framework is provided to interpret depth-dependent computations in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />The article explores how large language models (LLMs) perform causal reasoning in narratives. It finds that LLMs often use simplistic heuristics and rely on memorized world knowledge rather than contextual understanding. The study shows that simple task modifications can improve reasoning accuracy. Evaluation across various causal structures reveals patterns in LLM behavior. This research lays the foundation for enhancing LLMs' ability to engage in principled causal inference.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2410.23884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to robustly identify causal relationships is essential for autonomous decision-making and adaptation to novel scenarios. However, accurately inferring causal structure requires integrating both world knowledge and abstract logical reasoning. In this work, we investigate the interaction between these two capabilities through the representative task of causal reasoning over narratives. Through controlled synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world experiments, we find that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) often rely on superficial heuristics -- for example, inferring causality from event order or recalling memorized world knowledge without attending to context. Furthermore, we show that simple reformulations of the task can elicit more robust reasoning behavior. Our evaluation spans a range of causal structures, from linear chains to complex graphs involving colliders and forks. These findings uncover systematic patterns in how LLMs perform causal reasoning and lay the groundwork for developing methods that better align LLM behavior with principled causal inference.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a Bayesian framework using Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to extrapolate neural scaling laws. By creating a prior distribution that samples synthetic functions resembling real-world scaling laws, the PFN can meta-learn extrapolation. The method outperforms existing point estimation and Bayesian approaches, particularly in data-limited scenarios like Bayesian active learning. This approach allows for reliable and uncertainty-aware extrapolation, crucial for decision-making applications involving neural scaling and resource investment. <div>

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible, plug-and-play framework for diffusion inference-time density estimation and control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions. RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective, stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility. Experiments demonstrate that RNE delivers strong results in diffusion density estimation, and offers broad applicability to inference-time control tasks -- such as annealing, diffusion model composition, and reward-tilting -- with promising inference-time scaling performance.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is the ability to train a model robust against severe outliers, while assuring that the training process is stable. The Wasserstein-2 or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

<div> reinforcement learning, reward modeling, language models, generation probabilities, regularization

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with large language models relies on reward models to improve performance, especially in scenarios like reinforcement learning from human feedback. Current reward modeling based on overall response scores may struggle to identify specific components within response trajectories that correlate with scores, leading to poor generalization. This paper proposes leveraging generation probabilities to establish reward consistency across processes in response trajectories, providing fine-grained signals for reward learning. An intra-trajectory consistency regularization is introduced to ensure that adjacent processes with higher generation probabilities maintain more consistent rewards. Application of this regularization improves the performance of the outcome reward model on RewardBench and induces better policies aligned with desired policy objectives. The trained reward model also achieves improved results in best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification tasks. The code implementing the proposed methodology is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.09813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a ``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital quality evaluation.

Summary:  
This study addresses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in following complex instructions, proposing a method to enhance their capabilities. The traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) approach is found to be ineffective as it only paraphrases instructions without deep reasoning. The proposed method focuses on decomposing complex instructions, acquiring data systematically, and using reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-centric rewards to cultivate reasoning skills. By incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling and utilizing sample-wise contrast and behavior cloning, the method enhances LLM performance significantly. Evaluations on seven benchmarks show a 11.74% improvement in performance for a 1.5B LLM compared to an 8B LLM. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. <br />

arXiv:2506.01413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data will be available later (under review).

Recursive training of generative models can sometimes lead to the collapse of the simulated probability distribution. This study shows that the outcome varies asymptotically based on the presence or absence of even a minor external sample contribution. The collapse phenomenon is observed to manifest differently in scenarios where external sources influence the training process. Understanding these two distinct behaviors can provide valuable insights into optimizing generative model training algorithms and addressing issues related to collapse in simulated probability distributions. <div>

Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to improve audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) by incorporating linguistic constraints as additional supervision signals. The proposed approach enhances speech quality and intelligibility without added computational cost during inference. The method shows consistent performance improvements in both multi-language settings and scenarios where visual cues are impaired. By leveraging linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, similar to how humans support speech perception, the AV-TSE model benefits from auxiliary sources of information provided by PSLMs and PLMs. The study demonstrates the robustness of the approach and its potential to enhance AV-TSE models for extracting target speakers in audio-visual data. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.

Summary:
FlexQuant is a dynamic precision-switching framework designed to optimize the balance between inference speed and accuracy in large language models (LLMs). It leverages model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to enable fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and adjust bit-widths during token generation. The framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment by dynamically managing precision requirements. Experimental results show that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across various language tasks while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. This approach addresses the memory bottleneck caused by the scaling of LLM parameter sizes compared to hardware capabilities, providing an effective solution for improving the deployment efficiency of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has exacerbated the memory bottleneck due to the widening gap between model parameter scaling and hardware capabilities. While post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

The article introduces a new deep learning method, Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), which predicts optimal transport plans between two graphs. It is trained using the fused unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss and employs a neural architecture with cross-attention conditioned on FUGW hyperparameters. ULOT demonstrates competitive loss prediction up to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional solvers, making it more scalable for large graphs. The predicted transport plan can serve as a warm start for classical solvers to enhance convergence speed. Additionally, the model's predicted transport plan is fully differentiable in relation to graph inputs and FUGW hyperparameters, facilitating the optimization of functionals of the ULOT plan. This advancement in deep learning offers a promising approach for efficient graph comparison and alignment.

Abstract: Optimal transport between graphs, based on Gromov-Wasserstein and
  other extensions, is a powerful tool for comparing and aligning
  graph structures. However, solving the associated non-convex
  optimization problems is computationally expensive, which limits the
  scalability of these methods to large graphs. In this work, we
  present Unbalanced Learning of Optimal Transport (ULOT), a deep
  learning method that predicts optimal transport plans between two
  graphs. Our method is trained by minimizing the fused unbalanced
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) loss. We propose a novel neural
  architecture with cross-attention that is conditioned on the FUGW
  tradeoff hyperparameters. We evaluate ULOT on synthetic stochastic
  block model (SBM) graphs and on real cortical surface data obtained
  from fMRI. ULOT predicts transport plans with competitive loss up to
  two orders of magnitude faster than classical solvers. Furthermore,
  the predicted plan can be used as a warm start for classical solvers
  to accelerate their convergence. Finally, the predicted transport
  plan is fully differentiable with respect to the graph inputs and
  FUGW hyperparameters, enabling the optimization of functionals of

<div> Keywords: vessel trajectory prediction, Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), kinematic model, AIS datasets, maritime activities

Summary:
Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for various maritime applications. Traditional data-driven models often lack physical constraints, leading to inaccurate forecasts. In this study, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach is proposed for trajectory prediction by integrating a kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process. The method utilizes a physics-based loss function that enforces adherence to fundamental physical principles through penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. Evaluation on real-world AIS datasets shows that the proposed PINN approach significantly reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% compared to state-of-the-art models while maintaining physical consistency. This improved accuracy in trajectory prediction enhances model reliability and suitability for mission-critical maritime activities, ultimately leading to better situational awareness in marine environments.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is crucial for navigational safety, route optimization, traffic management, search and rescue operations, and autonomous navigation. Traditional data-driven models lack real-world physical constraints, leading to forecasts that disobey vessel motion dynamics, such as in scenarios with limited or noisy data where sudden course changes or speed variations occur due to external factors. To address this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for trajectory prediction that integrates a streamlined kinematic model for vessel motion into the neural network training process via a first- and second-order, finite difference physics-based loss function. This loss function, discretized using the first-order forward Euler method, Heun's second-order approximation, and refined with a midpoint approximation based on Taylor series expansion, enforces fidelity to fundamental physical principles by penalizing deviations from expected kinematic behavior. We evaluated PINN using real-world AIS datasets that cover diverse maritime conditions and compared it with state-of-the-art models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces average displacement errors by up to 32% across models and datasets while maintaining physical consistency. These results enhance model reliability and adherence to mission-critical maritime activities, where precision translates into better situational awareness in the oceans.

Abstract: Understanding socio-academic and economic factors influencing students' performance is crucial for effective educational interventions. This study employs several machine learning techniques and causal analysis to predict and elucidate the impacts of these factors on academic performance. We constructed a hypothetical causal graph and collected data from 1,050 student profiles. Following meticulous data cleaning and visualization, we analyze linear relationships through correlation and variable plots, and perform causal analysis on the hypothetical graph. Regression and classification models are applied for prediction, and unsupervised causality analysis using PC, GES, ICA-LiNGAM, and GRASP algorithms is conducted. Our regression analysis shows that Ridge Regression achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.12 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.024, indicating robustness, while classification models like Random Forest achieve nearly perfect F1-scores. The causal analysis shows significant direct and indirect effects of factors such as class attendance, study hours, and group study on CGPA. These insights are validated through unsupervised causality analysis. By integrating the best regression model into a web application, we are developing a practical tool for students and educators to enhance academic outcomes based on empirical evidence.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has recently emerged as a crucial research area, as data from distributed clients typically arrives as a stream, requiring sequential learning. This paper explores a more practical and challenging FCL setting, where clients may have unrelated or even conflicting data and tasks. In this scenario, statistical heterogeneity and data noise can create spurious correlations, leading to biased feature learning and catastrophic forgetting. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. Existing FCL approaches often use generative replay to create pseudo-datasets of previous tasks. However, generative replay itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting and task divergence among clients, leading to overfitting in FCL. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Spatio-Temporal grAdient Matching with network-free Prototype (STAMP). Our contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a model-agnostic method to determine subset of samples that effectively form prototypes when using a prototypical network, making it resilient to continual learning challenges; 2) We introduce a spatio-temporal gradient matching approach, applied at both the client-side (temporal) and server-side (spatial), to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity; 3) We leverage prototypes to approximate task-wise gradients, improving gradient matching on the client-side. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority over existing baselines.

Summary:
Neural watermarking using a convolutional autoencoder is proposed for ensuring data integrity in high-dimensional fields like climate modeling and fluid simulations. The framework invisibly embeds binary messages into structured data such as temperature and vorticity, maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1% MSE) and persistence under lossy transformations. Compared to SVD-based watermarking, the approach achieves over 98% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across different datasets. The system provides a scalable tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in scientific workflows, contributing to securing AI systems through verifiable watermarking. Evaluation on scientifically grounded datasets demonstrates the framework's effectiveness and its potential application in domains like satellite imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams. <div>

Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves $>$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5 and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.

<div> Generative Flow Networks, one-sided matching, efficiency, strategyproofness, manipulation<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces EMERGENT, a new approach to one-sided matching problems using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). These networks help in sampling diverse and high-reward solutions, leading to efficient and manipulation-resistant matches. EMERGENT balances efficiency and strategyproofness by producing matches that are both efficient and less vulnerable to manipulation compared to existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM). Experimental results show that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while reducing strategic vulnerability. The study demonstrates the potential of GFlowNets in social choice mechanisms to address the trade-off between efficiency and manipulability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The design of fair and efficient algorithms for allocating public resources, such as school admissions, housing, or medical residency, has a profound social impact. In one-sided matching problems, where individuals are assigned to items based on ranked preferences, a fundamental trade-off exists between efficiency and strategyproofness. Existing algorithms like Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD), Probabilistic Serial (PS), and Rank Minimization (RM) capture only one side of this trade-off: RSD is strategyproof but inefficient, while PS and RM are efficient but incentivize manipulation. We propose EMERGENT, a novel application of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to one-sided matching, leveraging its ability to sample diverse, high-reward solutions. In our approach, efficient and manipulation-resistant matches emerge naturally: high-reward solutions yield efficient matches, while the stochasticity of GFlowNets-based outputs reduces incentives for manipulation. Experiments show that EMERGENT outperforms RSD in rank efficiency while significantly reducing strategic vulnerability compared to matches produced by RM and PS. Our work highlights the potential of GFlowNets for applications involving social choice mechanisms, where it is crucial to balance efficiency and manipulability.

<div> forgetting curves, neural networks, cognitive science, memory decay, spaced repetition
<br />
Neural networks and cognitive science are linked in this study that explores if artificial models demonstrate human-like forgetting curves. Using Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory and spaced repetition principles, a framework is proposed to measure information retention in neural networks. The recall probability is calculated by comparing the network's current hidden state with previously stored prototype representations. This metric helps schedule review sessions to prevent catastrophic forgetting during deployment and improve training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons show that neural networks exhibit human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming more robust through scheduled reviews. The alignment between neural network forgetting curves and human memory models suggests that neural networks naturally emulate human memory decay, offering insights into continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition, we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored prototype representations. This retention metric facilitates the scheduling of review sessions, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting during deployment and enhancing training efficiency by prompting targeted reviews. Our experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons reveal human-like forgetting curves, with knowledge becoming increasingly robust through scheduled reviews. This alignment between neural network forgetting curves and established human memory models identifies neural networks as an architecture that naturally emulates human memory decay and can inform state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms.

<div> cache-aware attention, selective KV refresh, MAR models, image generation, efficiency
<br />
MARch\'e proposes a new framework for efficient masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. By introducing cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh, MARch\'e partitions tokens into active and cached sets, allowing for efficient reuse of key/value projections while ensuring contextually relevant information is refreshed as needed. This approach significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR models without altering the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to a 1.7x speedup in generation tasks while maintaining image quality. This makes MARch\'e a scalable and broadly applicable solution for enhancing the efficiency of masked transformer generation processes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked autoregressive (MAR) models unify the strengths of masked and autoregressive generation by predicting tokens in a fixed order using bidirectional attention for image generation. While effective, MAR models suffer from significant computational overhead, as they recompute attention and feed-forward representations for all tokens at every decoding step, despite most tokens remaining semantically stable across steps. We propose a training-free generation framework MARch\'e to address this inefficiency through two key components: cache-aware attention and selective KV refresh. Cache-aware attention partitions tokens into active and cached sets, enabling separate computation paths that allow efficient reuse of previously computed key/value projections without compromising full-context modeling. But a cached token cannot be used indefinitely without recomputation due to the changing contextual information over multiple steps. MARch\'e recognizes this challenge and applies a technique called selective KV refresh. Selective KV refresh identifies contextually relevant tokens based on attention scores from newly generated tokens and updates only those tokens that require recomputation, while preserving image generation quality. MARch\'e significantly reduces redundant computation in MAR without modifying the underlying architecture. Empirically, MARch\'e achieves up to 1.7x speedup with negligible impact on image quality, offering a scalable and broadly applicable solution for efficient masked transformer generation.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, text-to-image diffusion models, fine-tuning, noise optimization, alignment

Summary:
Noise PPO is a new minimalist reinforcement learning algorithm designed to optimize the initial noise distribution in text-to-image diffusion models. The approach focuses on improving text-image alignment and sample quality without the need for trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance techniques. By leaving the pre-trained diffusion model frozen and learning a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator, Noise PPO simplifies the fine-tuning process. Experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently enhances alignment and sample quality, especially at low inference steps. While the benefits of noise optimization diminish with an increasing number of inference steps, they remain present. These findings shed light on the "golden noise" hypothesis and highlight the practical value of minimalist reinforcement learning for improving diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework for efficiently training large language models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU clusters. By utilizing block coordinate descent (BCD) and engineering optimizations, the framework significantly reduces pre-training costs compared to traditional methods. BCD ensures model convergence and performs gradient computation at the level of parameter blocks. Results show that BCD lowers training costs by approximately 33% on A100 and A800 clusters while achieving a cost reduction of approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters for the 7B model. Additionally, BCD enables seamless migration of large-scale models from high-end A100 clusters to more cost-effective 4090 clusters without compromising model accuracy. In both scenarios, BCD training retains the same level of model accuracy as traditional full-parameter pre-training. This framework provides a cost-effective solution for small- to medium-sized teams looking to train large language models efficiently.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we present a full-parameter pre-training framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), augmented with engineering optimizations, to efficiently train large models on affordable RTX 4090 GPU clusters. BCD ensures model convergence based on block coordinate descent theory and performs gradient computation and update at the level of parameter blocks. Experiments show that 1) Lower cost of Same-Device: BCD significantly reduces pre-training cost. For the 7B model, under identical hardware settings, BCD lowers training costs to approximately 33% on A100,A800 clusters on 7B model averagely and to approximately 2.6% on RTX 4090 clusters on 7B model, compared to traditional full-parameter training. 2) Cross-Device Transfer: By leveraging BCD, large-scale models previously trainable only on high-end A100 clusters can be seamlessly migrated and pre-trained on 4090 clusters-whose hourly cost is only one-quarter that of A100-without requiring expensive hardware. 3) Accuracy Retention: In both scenarios, BCD training achieves the same level of model accuracy as full-parameter pre-training.

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model (LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at https://github.com/Chooovy/BTC-LLM.

<br />Summary:
This research introduces a novel approach to network pruning by utilizing a metanetwork derived from meta-learning. By establishing a mapping between neural networks and graphs, a graph neural network is employed as the metanetwork to automatically learn a pruning strategy. The trained metanetwork can transform difficult-to-prune networks into more manageable ones, leading to state-of-the-art pruning results on various tasks. The approach involves feeding networks through the metanetwork and then fine-tuning to achieve effective pruning. The method outperforms existing techniques on popular pruning tasks for models like ResNet56, VGG19, and ResNet50 on datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. The code for this research is publicly available on GitHub, enabling further exploration and application of the proposed method.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy, has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet).

However, some of these methods lack detailed explanations in the input space due to upscaling issues or may require random perturbations to extract the explanations. We propose Convolutional Rectifier for Interpretable Time Series Classification, or CRITS, as an interpretable model for time series classification that is designed to intrinsically extract local explanations. The proposed method uses a layer of convolutional kernels, a max-pooling layer and a fully-connected rectifier network (a network with only rectified linear unit activations). The rectified linear unit activation allows the extraction of the feature weights for the given sample, eliminating the need to calculate gradients, use random perturbations and the upscale of the saliency maps to the initial input space. We evaluate CRITS on a set of datasets, and study its classification performance and its explanation alignment, sensitivity and understandability.

<br />Summary: 
The study explores low-bit weight-only quantization's impact on large language models (LLMs) and identifies strong correlations (avg. 0.82) in quantization errors of diverse 3-4 bit methods on FineWeb examples. The research suggests that residual stream magnitudes in full-precision models can predict future quantization errors and presents a hypothesis linking residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation across layers. By implementing LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, the study demonstrates that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in late layers and highlights the significance of MLP gates in maintaining perplexity. The findings shed light on why certain examples experience significant quantization errors and identify critical model components essential for performance preservation. <div>

Abstract: Low-bit weight-only quantization significantly reduces the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs), but disproportionately affects certain examples. We analyze diverse 3-4 bit methods on LLMs ranging from 7B-70B in size and find that the quantization errors of 50 pairs of methods are strongly correlated (avg. 0.82) on FineWeb examples. Moreover, the residual stream magnitudes of full-precision models are indicative of future quantization errors. We further establish a hypothesis that relates the residual stream magnitudes to error amplification and accumulation over layers. Using LLM localization techniques, early exiting, and activation patching, we show that examples with large errors rely on precise residual activations in the late layers, and that the outputs of MLP gates play a crucial role in maintaining the perplexity. Our work reveals why certain examples result in large quantization errors and which model components are most critical for performance preservation.

Summary: 
The Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON) is introduced as a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture aimed at accurately reconstructing global scalar fields from sparse and non-uniform proxy measurements. Unlike traditional approaches, TRON focuses on the inverse problem of reconstructing current global fields from sparse, evolving sensor sequences. Trained on 22 years of simulation data, TRON generalizes across various spatial locations, days, and sequence lengths, achieving sub-second inference with low relative L2 errors. Specifically applied in cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data. Its potential applications extend to atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting. <div>

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of latent environmental fields from sparse and indirect observations is a foundational challenge across scientific domains-from atmospheric science and geophysics to public health and aerospace safety. Traditional approaches rely on physics-based simulators or dense sensor networks, both constrained by high computational cost, latency, or limited spatial coverage. We present the Temporal Radiation Operator Network (TRON), a spatiotemporal neural operator architecture designed to infer continuous global scalar fields from sequences of sparse, non-uniform proxy measurements.
  Unlike recent forecasting models that operate on dense, gridded inputs to predict future states, TRON addresses a more ill-posed inverse problem: reconstructing the current global field from sparse, temporally evolving sensor sequences, without access to future observations or dense labels. Demonstrated on global cosmic radiation dose reconstruction, TRON is trained on 22 years of simulation data and generalizes across 65,341 spatial locations, 8,400 days, and sequence lengths from 7 to 90 days. It achieves sub-second inference with relative L2 errors below 0.1%, representing a >58,000X speedup over Monte Carlo-based estimators. Though evaluated in the context of cosmic radiation, TRON offers a domain-agnostic framework for scientific field reconstruction from sparse data, with applications in atmospheric modeling, geophysical hazard monitoring, and real-time environmental risk forecasting.

<div> framework, quantifying, geometric uncertainties, metamaterials, GUST <br />
<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces GUST, a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties in metamaterial manufacturing. GUST utilizes deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries based on nominal designs. It employs a two-stage learning process, starting with self-supervised pretraining on a synthetic dataset to capture structure variability and approximate distributions. Transfer learning is then used to fine-tune the model on real-world manufacturing data. GUST's effectiveness is showcased with only 960 additively manufactured unit cells in two passes, demonstrating its ability to capture geometry and material property variability. Directly training on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient. This scalable and cost-effective approach reduces data requirements while effectively learning complex geometric uncertainties, making it suitable for industries like aerospace and biomedical engineering where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties is crucial. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently, GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are critical.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve health outcomes.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of pretrained models in Machine Learning (ML) presents significant challenges for practitioners. Given a new dataset, they need to determine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as models grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a bottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively. Addressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and hyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and more of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data augmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine learning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally designed for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts meta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain. We propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer Vision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline ranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune large language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform finetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and synthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We empirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using Self-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies. Leveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data generators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments. Additionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context learning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data.

<div> linearity score, neural networks, function approximation, regression, interpretability

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of the linearity score $\lambda(f)$ as a measure to assess how well a neural network's output can be replicated by a linear model. This score is calculated as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and a linear surrogate model. The study evaluates this framework on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that a high linearity score indicates strong linear alignment but does not always guarantee predictive accuracy. This highlights the potential and limitations of using linear models to interpret the behavior of complex neural networks in regression tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures the nature of the functions they learn. In this work, we propose the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ offers insight into the linear decodability of the learned function. We evaluate this framework on both synthetic ($y = x \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. Our findings show that while high $\lambda(f)$ scores indicate strong linear alignment, they do not necessarily imply predictive accuracy with respect to the ground truth. This underscores both the promise and the limitations of using linear surrogates to understand nonlinear model behavior, particularly in high-stakes regression tasks.

Summary:
In a new study, researchers compare discriminative and generative classifiers in the context of modern architectures such as Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. The research explores how different architectures perform in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across various scenarios.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.

<br />Summary: <br />The article introduces a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Data is represented as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold and approximated using a variational autoencoder (VAE). A geometric graph is constructed based on the embeddings obtained from the VAE, transforming the classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. The study includes a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this pipeline, showing that the generalization gap diminishes with increasing graph size. It also demonstrates that resampling a slightly larger graph during training can further reduce the generalization gap. Numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>
arXiv:2506.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.

Summary:
The provided algorithm focuses on generating continuous-time data, particularly useful in sensitive domains like healthcare. By utilizing trajectory inference and mean-field Langevin dynamics, the algorithm ensures privacy while generating realistic trajectories. Notably, it offers improved privacy guarantees as individuals only need to contribute data for one time point, unlike previous methods that required their entire temporal trajectory. The computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics, equivalent to noisy particle gradient descent, allows for applying differential privacy results for noisy SGD to the continuous-time data generation. Experiments conducted on a synthesized version of hand-drawn MNIST data demonstrated the algorithm's effectiveness in generating realistic trajectories while maintaining privacy. Overall, the algorithm provides strong utility guarantees and privacy characteristics, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring the generation of continuous-time data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm to privately generate continuous-time data (e.g. marginals from stochastic differential equations), which has applications in highly sensitive domains involving time-series data such as healthcare. We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.

Summary: 
Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms lack context awareness, leading to inefficient task prioritization. This paper introduces semantic scheduling, leveraging language models for intelligent task prioritization based on process semantics. A new scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity is proposed, focusing on minimizing waiting time in scheduling requests from large language models. The potential benefits of semantic scheduling are demonstrated through a medical emergency management application, highlighting its utility in critical, time-sensitive tasks. The research provides a novel approach to enhancing scheduling algorithms by incorporating semantic analysis, making scheduling decisions more context-aware and efficient. <div>
arXiv:2506.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional operating system scheduling algorithms are largely content-ignorant, making decisions based on factors such as latency or fairness without considering the actual intents or semantics of processes. Consequently, these algorithms often do not prioritize tasks that require urgent attention or carry higher importance, such as in emergency management scenarios. However, recent advances in language models enable semantic analysis of processes, allowing for more intelligent and context-aware scheduling decisions. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic scheduling in scheduling of requests from large language models (LLM), where the semantics of the process guide the scheduling priorities. We present a novel scheduling algorithm with optimal time complexity, designed to minimize the overall waiting time in LLM-based prompt scheduling. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a medical emergency management application, underscoring the potential benefits of semantic scheduling for critical, time-sensitive tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that allows clients to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models with different local trainable LoRA layers. The framework addresses the issue of heterogeneous resources among clients by developing HLA strategies to adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' capabilities and the importance of layers. Two main HLA strategies are proposed: one based on dynamic layer importance utilizing Fisher Information Matrix scores, and another focusing on the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers through geometrically-defined patterns. A randomized version of the geometrically-defined strategy is also introduced for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies in various federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, including different levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning has recently been utilized to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models across multiple clients. Notably, federated low-rank adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck, and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy. We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both effective and efficient.

<div> emergence, self-reflection, large language model, reinforcement learning, reasoning

Summary:
Self-reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to revisit, evaluate, and revise their own reasoning, has been shown to improve reasoning accuracy. This behavior is not exclusive to models trained with reinforcement learning, as pretrained models also exhibit self-reflection, although rarely. By introducing a method called Reflection-Inducing Probing, researchers were able to increase the frequency of self-reflection in pretrained models significantly. Internal representations in both pretrained and fine-tuned models show distinct hidden states that differentiate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. A self-reflection vector was constructed, enabling bidirectional control over self-reflective behavior in models. Manipulating this vector improved reasoning performance by up to 12% and allowed for the adjustment of the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without additional training. This study enhances our understanding of self-reflection mechanisms in LLMs and demonstrates the potential for precise behavioral control through the manipulation of internal model representations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge posed by the quadratic complexity of self-attention in transformers, hindering effective scaling to long input sequences. It suggests that utilizing small transformers optimized for processing short input sequences could efficiently simulate large transformers handling long sequences. The study proves that any transformer with input length N can be simulated by O((N/M)^2) small transformers with input length M, and in scenarios like average-case inputs, sliding window masking, and attention sinks, the optimal number of small transformers needed is O(N/M). Additionally, it establishes that this optimal efficiency cannot be improved in the worst case. This approach offers a potential solution for effectively handling long input sequences in transformers by leveraging the processing efficiency of small transformers.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention prevents transformers from scaling effectively to long input sequences. On the other hand, modern GPUs and other specialized hardware accelerators are well-optimized for processing small input sequences in transformers during both training and inference. A natural question arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers to deal with long input sequences?
  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large transformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take short input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any transformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only $O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \ll N$, and that this cannot be improved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural scenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention sinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This thesis explores incorporating causality into machine learning to improve tasks such as Out-of-Distribution generalization. By leveraging the principle of independent causal mechanisms, which states that causal mechanisms do not influence each other, the study applies causality to graphs, a common data structure in various industries. Learning causality enhances machine learning's OOD generalization, interpretability, and robustness to adversarial attacks. However, optimizing for causality poses a challenge to traditional ERM objectives. <div>

Abstract: In the past decades, machine learning with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) has demonstrated great capability in learning and exploiting the statistical patterns from data, or even surpassing humans. Despite the success, ERM avoids the modeling of causality the way of understanding and handling changes, which is fundamental to human intelligence. When deploying models beyond the training environment, distribution shifts are everywhere. For example, an autopilot system often needs to deal with new weather conditions that have not been seen during training, An Al-aided drug discovery system needs to predict the biochemical properties of molecules with respect to new viruses such as COVID-19. It renders the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization challenging to conventional machine learning.
  In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate and realize the causality for broader tasks in modern machine learning. In particular, we exploit the invariance implied by the principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM), that is, the causal mechanisms generating the effects from causes do not inform or influence each other. Therefore, the conditional distribution between the target variable given its causes is invariant under distribution shifts. With the causal invariance principle, we first instantiate it to graphs -- a general data structure ubiquitous in many real-world industry and scientific applications, such as financial networks and molecules. Then, we shall see how learning the causality benefits many of the desirable properties of modern machine learning, in terms of (i) OOD generalization capability; (ii) interpretability; and (iii) robustness to adversarial attacks.
  Realizing the causality in machine learning, on the other hand, raises a dilemma for optimization in conventional machine learning, as it often contradicts the objective of ERM...

<div> causal discovery, Large Language Models, fairness, active learning, dynamic scoring
Summary:
The article introduces a hybrid framework for causal discovery that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with a breadth-first search strategy, active learning, and dynamic scoring. This approach aims to improve the efficiency and robustness of discovering fairness-relevant pathways in complex systems. Using a semi-synthetic benchmark based on the UCI Adult dataset, the framework is evaluated in recovering global structure and fairness-critical paths under noisy conditions. Results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed approach, outperform traditional methods in identifying these pathways. The study also examines the benefits of dynamic scoring and active querying in enhancing the discovery process. The findings have implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing causal relationships in machine learning models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery (CD) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex systems. While recent algorithms can detect spurious associations and latent confounding, many struggle to recover fairness-relevant pathways in realistic, noisy settings. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their access to broad semantic knowledge, offer a promising complement to statistical CD approaches, particularly in domains where metadata provides meaningful relational cues. Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding how sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often introduce spurious or biased pathways. We propose a hybrid LLM-based framework for CD that extends a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy with active learning and dynamic scoring. Variable pairs are prioritized for LLM-based querying using a composite score based on mutual information, partial correlation, and LLM confidence, improving discovery efficiency and robustness.
  To evaluate fairness sensitivity, we construct a semi-synthetic benchmark from the UCI Adult dataset, embedding a domain-informed causal graph with injected noise, label corruption, and latent confounding. We assess how well CD methods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.
  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method, demonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways under noisy conditions. We highlight when dynamic scoring and active querying are most beneficial and discuss implications for bias auditing in real-world datasets.

Summary:

The results show strong correlations with ground-truth explanations and positive user feedback, confirming the effectiveness of LLMs as enablers of Human-Centered eXplainable AI. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly embedded in critical decision-making systems, however their foundational ``black-box'' models require eXplainable AI (XAI) solutions to enhance transparency, which are mostly oriented to experts, making no sense to non-experts. Alarming evidence about AI's unprecedented human values risks brings forward the imperative need for transparent human-centered XAI solutions. In this work, we introduce a domain-, model-, explanation-agnostic, generalizable and reproducible framework that ensures both transparency and human-centered explanations tailored to the needs of both experts and non-experts. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and employs in-context learning to convey domain- and explainability-relevant contextual knowledge into LLMs. Through its structured prompt and system setting, our framework encapsulates in one response explanations understandable by non-experts and technical information to experts, all grounded in domain and explainability principles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we establish a ground-truth contextual ``thesaurus'' through a rigorous benchmarking with over 40 data, model, and XAI combinations for an explainable clustering analysis of a well-being scenario. Through a comprehensive quality and human-friendliness evaluation of our framework's explanations, we prove high content quality through strong correlations with ground-truth explanations (Spearman rank correlation=0.92) and improved interpretability and human-friendliness to non-experts through a user study (N=56). Our overall evaluation confirms trust in LLMs as HCXAI enablers, as our framework bridges the above Gaps by delivering (i) high-quality technical explanations aligned with foundational XAI methods and (ii) clear, efficient, and interpretable human-centered explanations for non-experts.

Summary:
This article introduces a collaborative recommender system based on machine learning to optimize process parameters for a fleet of networked manufacturing machines.

Abstract: Fleets of networked manufacturing machines of the same type, that are collocated or geographically distributed, are growing in popularity. An excellent example is the rise of 3D printing farms, which consist of multiple networked 3D printers operating in parallel, enabling faster production and efficient mass customization. However, optimizing process parameters across a fleet of manufacturing machines, even of the same type, remains a challenge due to machine-to-machine variability. Traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient, requiring extensive testing to determine optimal process parameters for an entire fleet. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based collaborative recommender system that optimizes process parameters for each machine in a fleet by modeling the problem as a sequential matrix completion task. Our approach leverages spectral clustering and alternating least squares to iteratively refine parameter predictions, enabling real-time collaboration among the machines in a fleet while minimizing the number of experimental trials. We validate our method using a mini 3D printing farm consisting of ten 3D printers for which we optimize acceleration and speed settings to maximize print quality and productivity. Our approach achieves significantly faster convergence to optimal process parameters compared to non-collaborative matrix completion.

arXiv:2506.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.

Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of grokking in deep networks, which refers to delayed generalization and emergent robustness to input perturbations during training. It explains how grokking is captured in the Jacobian of a deep network, with the alignment of Jacobians with training data ensuring grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. The proposed GrokAlign method utilizes Jacobian regularization to induce grokking earlier in training compared to traditional regularizers like weight decay. Additionally, centroid alignment simplifies Jacobian alignment, aiding in identifying and tracking different stages of deep network training dynamics. The study provides theoretical insights into optimizing deep networks and highlights the advantages of aligning Jacobians in training dynamics. It also offers practical applications through the introduction of the GrokAlign method and centroid alignment for improved understanding of deep network behaviors. <div>
arXiv:2506.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-thought prompting, large language models, confirmation bias, reasoning generation, answer prediction

Summary:
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is used to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies across tasks. This study explores CoT behavior through the concept of confirmation bias from cognitive psychology. It investigates how model beliefs impact both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By analyzing model beliefs, rationale attributes, and performance, the study uncovers strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, influencing both reasoning and answer prediction processes. The study also discusses task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the impact of belief strength on CoT effectiveness. Overall, the research highlights the importance of developing prompting strategies that counter confirmation bias to improve reasoning performance. The code for the study is available at https://github.com/yuewan2/biasedcot. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- CoT prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs
- Confirmation bias influences reasoning and answer prediction
- Model beliefs skew the reasoning process
- Task vulnerability and belief strength impact CoT effectiveness
- Better prompting strategies needed to mitigate confirmation bias. <div>
arXiv:2506.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance. Code is available at \textit{https://github.com/yuewan2/biasedcot}.

Summary:
The article introduces SPIRE, a framework that enables on-device personalization and effective federated learning with diffusion models. SPIRE divides the network into a global backbone and client embeddings, allowing for efficient parameter finetuning. The theoretical analysis bridges conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models, showing the recovery of optimal mixing weights through gradient descent. Empirical results demonstrate SPIRE's superior performance in collaborative pretraining and adaptation to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating few parameters. SPIRE also addresses catastrophic forgetting and remains robust across different finetuning settings. <div>
arXiv:2506.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their sheer size makes on device personalization, and thus effective federated learning (FL), infeasible. We propose Shared Backbone Personal Identity Representation Embeddings (SPIRE), a framework that casts per client diffusion based generation as conditional generation in FL. SPIRE factorizes the network into (i) a high capacity global backbone that learns a population level score function and (ii) lightweight, learnable client embeddings that encode local data statistics. This separation enables parameter efficient finetuning that touches $\leq 0.01\%$ of weights. We provide the first theoretical bridge between conditional diffusion training and maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian mixture models. For a two component mixture we prove that gradient descent on the DDPM with respect to mixing weights loss recovers the optimal mixing weights and enjoys dimension free error bounds. Our analysis also hints at how client embeddings act as biases that steer a shared score network toward personalized distributions. Empirically, SPIRE matches or surpasses strong baselines during collaborative pretraining, and vastly outperforms them when adapting to unseen clients, reducing Kernel Inception Distance while updating only hundreds of parameters. SPIRE further mitigates catastrophic forgetting and remains robust across finetuning learning rate and epoch choices.

Summary: <br />
The article addresses challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and average treatment effects (CATE) due to hidden confounders in observational data. It introduces a method using a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) along with a pseudo-confounder generator to align potential outcomes from observational data with RCT outcomes. This approach does not assume covariate information for the RCT dataset, making it suitable for scenarios with privacy concerns like medical applications. The method aims to mitigate bias introduced by unobserved confounders and has been validated through extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>
arXiv:2506.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in estimating conditional potential outcomes and conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is the presence of hidden confounders. Since testing for hidden confounders cannot be accomplished only with observational data, conditional unconfoundedness is commonly assumed in the literature of CATE estimation. Nevertheless, under this assumption, CATE estimation can be significantly biased due to the effects of unobserved confounders. In this work, we consider the case where in addition to a potentially large observational dataset, a small dataset from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is available. Notably, we make no assumptions on the existence of any covariate information for the RCT dataset, we only require the outcomes to be observed. We propose a CATE estimation method based on a pseudo-confounder generator and a CATE model that aligns the learned potential outcomes from the observational data with those observed from the RCT. Our method is applicable to many practical scenarios of interest, particularly those where privacy is a concern (e.g., medical applications). Extensive numerical experiments are provided demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Summary:
1. The study focuses on analyzing memorization patterns in the Pythia model family, examining factors like model scale, data characteristics, and perturbations.
2. Larger models display incremental memorization expansion but decreased efficiency as scale increases.
3. The rate of new memorization acquisition decreases with model scale, while old memorization forgetting increases.
4. Data characteristics such as token frequency and repetition count have differential effects on memorized versus non-memorized samples.
5. Prefix perturbations decrease memorization and increase generation uncertainty proportionally to their strength, with low-redundancy samples being more vulnerable. Larger models do not offer additional robustness against perturbations. These findings contribute to understanding memorization mechanisms and have implications for training optimization, privacy protection, and architectural enhancements. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability for verbatim memorization. While numerous works have explored factors influencing model memorization, the dynamic evolution memorization patterns remains underexplored. This paper presents a detailed analysis of memorization in the Pythia model family across varying scales and training steps under prefix perturbations. Using granular metrics, we examine how model architecture, data characteristics, and perturbations influence these patterns. Our findings reveal that: (1) as model scale increases, memorization expands incrementally while efficiency decreases rapidly; (2) as model scale increases, the rate of new memorization acquisition decreases while old memorization forgetting increases; (3) data characteristics (token frequency, repetition count, and uncertainty) differentially affect memorized versus non-memorized samples; and (4) prefix perturbations reduce memorization and increase generation uncertainty proportionally to perturbation strength, with low-redundancy samples showing higher vulnerability and larger models offering no additional robustness. These findings advance our understanding of memorization mechanisms, with direct implications for training optimization, privacy safeguards, and architectural improvements.

arXiv:2506.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries (cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to minutes compared with human experts.

Abstract: We propose an efficient encrypted policy synthesis to develop privacy-preserving model-based reinforcement learning. We first demonstrate that the relative-entropy-regularized reinforcement learning framework offers a computationally convenient linear and ``min-free'' structure for value iteration, enabling a direct and efficient integration of fully homomorphic encryption with bootstrapping into policy synthesis. Convergence and error bounds are analyzed as encrypted policy synthesis propagates errors under the presence of encryption-induced errors including quantization and bootstrapping. Theoretical analysis is validated by numerical simulations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RERL framework in integrating FHE for encrypted policy synthesis.

Summary:
HYPER is proposed as a foundation model for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs, allowing for prediction of missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities and relations. It can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and relations, by encoding entities and their positions in hyperedges. The model outperforms existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, displaying strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures. 16 new inductive datasets were constructed to evaluate HYPER, covering a diverse range of relation types with varying arities. This model shows promising results for inductive link prediction tasks and demonstrates the ability to transfer knowledge across different relation types. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.

- Previous research highlighted statistical disparities in intensive care units but lacked causal formalization.
- The study uses a causal inference-based approach to investigate how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements impact clinical decision-making in ICUs.

arXiv:2506.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in decision-making.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Secondary Risks, Safety Mechanisms, Evaluation, Benchmarks

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in critical applications, posing challenges in ensuring their safety and alignment with societal functions. While previous research has focused on adversarial attacks, this study introduces the concept of secondary risks, which are non-adversarial failures arising from imperfect generalization during benign interactions. These risks, characterized by harmful or misleading behaviors, can evade standard safety mechanisms. The study presents two risk primitives and a search framework, SecLens, to systematically evaluate secondary risk behaviors. A benchmark dataset, SecRiskBench, comprising 650 prompts across eight real-world risk categories, is also introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that secondary risks are prevalent, transferable across models, and independent of modality. The study highlights the critical need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel sparse and structured parameterization for sum blocks in Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) to enhance scalability. By utilizing sparse Monarch matrices instead of dense matrices, the method reduces memory and computation costs, enabling significant scaling of PCs. The approach, inspired by circuit multiplication theory, achieves state-of-the-art generative modeling performance on benchmarks like Text8, LM1B, and ImageNet. Additionally, it demonstrates superior scaling behavior by achieving the same performance with fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training compared to previous scaling efforts. The combination of sparse and structured parameterization enhances the efficiency and scalability of PCs for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are tractable representations of probability distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Recent advancements have improved the scalability of PCs either by leveraging their sparse properties or through the use of tensorized operations for better hardware utilization. However, no existing method fully exploits both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse and structured parameterization for the sum blocks in PCs. By replacing dense matrices with sparse Monarch matrices, we significantly reduce the memory and computation costs, enabling unprecedented scaling of PCs. From a theory perspective, our construction arises naturally from circuit multiplication; from a practical perspective, compared to previous efforts on scaling up tractable probabilistic models, our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art generative modeling performance on challenging benchmarks like Text8, LM1B and ImageNet, but also demonstrates superior scaling behavior, achieving the same performance with substantially less compute as measured by the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during training.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of Clustering of Bandits (CB) and Clustering of Neural Bandits (CNB), highlighting their effectiveness in sequential decision-making. However, CNB algorithms face a loss of plasticity over time, hindering their adaptability in dynamic environments. To address this, the proposed Selective Reinitialization (SeRe) framework selectively resets underutilized units to maintain adaptability while preserving stable knowledge retention. By combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, an adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency based on non-stationarity, leading to sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments. Experimental results on real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms outperform traditional approaches by mitigating loss of plasticity and improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering of Bandits (CB) methods enhance sequential decision-making by grouping bandits into clusters based on similarity and incorporating cluster-level contextual information, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability in applications like personalized streaming recommendations. However, when extending CB algorithms to their neural version (commonly referred to as Clustering of Neural Bandits, or CNB), they suffer from loss of plasticity, where neural network parameters become rigid and less adaptable over time, limiting their ability to adapt to non-stationary environments (e.g., dynamic user preferences in recommendation). To address this challenge, we propose Selective Reinitialization (SeRe), a novel bandit learning framework that dynamically preserves the adaptability of CNB algorithms in evolving environments. SeRe leverages a contribution utility metric to identify and selectively reset underutilized units, mitigating loss of plasticity while maintaining stable knowledge retention. Furthermore, when combining SeRe with CNB algorithms, the adaptive change detection mechanism adjusts the reinitialization frequency according to the degree of non-stationarity, ensuring effective adaptation without unnecessary resets. Theoretically, we prove that SeRe enables sublinear cumulative regret in piecewise-stationary environments, outperforming traditional CNB approaches in long-term performances. Extensive experiments on six real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate that SeRe-enhanced CNB algorithms can effectively mitigate the loss of plasticity with lower regrets, improving adaptability and robustness in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia classification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions. The use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they offer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse settings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models in clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead, trustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates multiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two public datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior performance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of 98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the Chapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the relevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its predictions. While quantitative features further improve classification performance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable for real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better classification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for interpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable ECG monitoring.

Abstract: While contrastive multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable success, it implicitly assumes balanced class distribution. However, real-world multi-view data primarily exhibits class imbalance distribution. Consequently, existing methods suffer performance degradation due to their inability to perceive and model such imbalance. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic study of imbalanced multi-view clustering, focusing on two fundamental problems: i. perceiving class imbalance distribution, and ii. mitigating representation degradation of minority samples. We propose PROTOCOL, a novel PaRtial Optimal TranspOrt-enhanced COntrastive Learning framework for imbalanced multi-view clustering. First, for class imbalance perception, we map multi-view features into a consensus space and reformulate the imbalanced clustering as a partial optimal transport (POT) problem, augmented with progressive mass constraints and weighted KL divergence for class distributions. Second, we develop a POT-enhanced class-rebalanced contrastive learning at both feature and class levels, incorporating logit adjustment and class-sensitive learning to enhance minority sample representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PROTOCOL significantly improves clustering performance on imbalanced multi-view data, filling a critical research gap in this field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain time series imputation is an underexplored data-centric research task that presents significant challenges, particularly when the target domain suffers from high missing rates and domain shifts in temporal dynamics. Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.

Abstract: The identification of channel scenarios in wireless systems plays a crucial role in channel modeling, radio fingerprint positioning, and transceiver design. Traditional methods to classify channel scenarios are based on typical statistical characteristics of channels, such as K-factor, path loss, delay spread, etc. However, statistic-based channel identification methods cannot accurately differentiate implicit features induced by dynamic scatterers, thus performing very poorly in identifying similar channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel channel scenario identification method, formulating the identification task as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Furthermore, the MAP estimation is reformulated by a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is then approximated and solved by the conditional generative diffusion model. Specifically, we leverage a transformer network to capture hidden channel features in multiple latent noise spaces within the reverse process of the conditional generative diffusion model. These detailed features, which directly affect likelihood functions in MLE, enable highly accurate scenario identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs), and random forest-based classifiers, improving the identification accuracy by more than 10%.

Abstract: Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-{\delta}, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful.

<title>Merlin: Multi-View Representation Learning for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Unfixed Missing Rates</title>

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) involves predicting future values of multiple interrelated time series. Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks but struggle with label noise in real-world data. Existing studies on graph learning with label noise commonly rely on class-dependent label noise, overlooking the complexities of instance-dependent noise and falling short of capturing real-world corruption patterns. We introduce BeGIN (Benchmarking for Graphs with Instance-dependent Noise), a new benchmark that provides realistic graph datasets with various noise types and comprehensively evaluates noise-handling strategies across GNN architectures, noisy label detection, and noise-robust learning. To simulate instance-dependent corruptions, BeGIN introduces algorithmic methods and LLM-based simulations. Our experiments reveal the challenges of instance-dependent noise, particularly LLM-based corruption, and underscore the importance of node-specific parameterization to enhance GNN robustness. By comprehensively evaluating noise-handling strategies, BeGIN provides insights into their effectiveness, efficiency, and key performance factors. We expect that BeGIN will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research on label noise in graphs and fostering the development of robust GNN training methods. The code is available at https://github.com/kimsu55/BeGIN.

Abstract: Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based method.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently gained attention in deep learning for their ability to efficiently model long-range dependencies, making them promising candidates for edge-AI applications. In this paper, we analyze the effects of quantization on small-scale SSMs with a focus on reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining task performance. Using the S4D architecture, we first investigate post-training quantization (PTQ) and show that the state matrix A and internal state x are particularly sensitive to quantization. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different quantization techniques applied to the parameters and activations in the S4D architecture. To address the observed performance drop after Post-training Quantization (PTQ), we apply Quantization-aware Training (QAT), significantly improving performance from 40% (PTQ) to 96% on the sequential MNIST benchmark at 8-bit precision. We further demonstrate the potential of QAT in enabling sub-8-bit precisions and evaluate different parameterization schemes for QAT stability. Additionally, we propose a heterogeneous quantization strategy that assigns different precision levels to model components, reducing the overall memory footprint by a factor of 6x without sacrificing performance. Our results provide actionable insights for deploying quantized SSMs in resource-constrained environments.

<title>Robust LLM Unlearning with MUDMAN: Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking And Normalization</title>

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

<title>Note on Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader in Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problems</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the optimality and complexity of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in size-invariant combinatorial semi-bandit problems. Recently, Honda et al. (2023) and Lee et al. (2024) showed that FTPL achieves Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) optimality in standard multi-armed bandit problems with Fr\'{e}chet-type distributions. However, the optimality of FTPL in combinatorial semi-bandit problems remains unclear. In this paper, we consider the regret bound of FTPL with geometric resampling (GR) in size-invariant semi-bandit setting, showing that FTPL respectively achieves $O\left(\sqrt{m^2 d^\frac{1}{\alpha}T}+\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ regret with Fr\'{e}chet distributions, and the best possible regret bound of $O\left(\sqrt{mdT}\right)$ with Pareto distributions in adversarial setting. Furthermore, we extend the conditional geometric resampling (CGR) to size-invariant semi-bandit setting, which reduces the computational complexity from $O(d^2)$ of original GR to $O\left(md\left(\log(d/m)+1\right)\right)$ without sacrificing the regret performance of FTPL.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) entails a variety of approaches for aligning models with human intent to alleviate the burden of reward engineering. However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.

<title>BSA: Ball Sparse Attention for Large-scale Geometries</title>

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods, yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

<title>PLD: A Choice-Theoretic List-Wise Knowledge Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12542</link>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact "student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger "teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation (PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST (arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in heterogeneous settings.

<title>Is your batch size the problem? Revisiting the Adam-SGD gap in language modeling</title>

Abstract: Adam is known to perform significantly better than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in language models, a phenomenon for which a number of explanations have been proposed. In this work, we revisit this "optimizer gap" through a series of comprehensively tuned baseline training runs for language modeling with Transformers. We exhaustively study how momentum, gradient clipping, and batch size affect the gap between SGD and Adam. Our empirical findings show that SGD with momentum can actually perform similarly to Adam in small-batch settings, if tuned correctly. We revisit existing explanations for Adam's advantage, including heavy-tailed class imbalance, directional sharpness, and Hessian heterogeneity, which struggle to directly explain this phenomenon. Towards bridging this gap in our understanding, by analyzing our Transformer training runs and simple quadratic settings inspired by the literature, we provide new insights, driven by stochastic differential equation models, into the role of batch size on the training dynamics.

<title>Beyond Laplace and Gaussian: Exploring the Generalized Gaussian Mechanism for Private Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12553</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is obtained by randomizing a data analysis algorithm, which necessarily introduces a tradeoff between its utility and privacy. Many DP mechanisms are built upon one of two underlying tools: Laplace and Gaussian additive noise mechanisms. We expand the search space of algorithms by investigating the Generalized Gaussian mechanism, which samples the additive noise term $x$ with probability proportional to $e^{-\frac{| x |}{\sigma}^{\beta} }$ for some $\beta \geq 1$. The Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms are special cases of GG for $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively.
  In this work, we prove that all members of the GG family satisfy differential privacy, and provide an extension of an existing numerical accountant (the PRV accountant) for these mechanisms. We show that privacy accounting for the GG Mechanism and its variants is dimension independent, which substantially improves computational costs of privacy accounting.
  We apply the GG mechanism to two canonical tools for private machine learning, PATE and DP-SGD; we show empirically that $\beta$ has a weak relationship with test-accuracy, and that generally $\beta=2$ (Gaussian) is nearly optimal. This provides justification for the widespread adoption of the Gaussian mechanism in DP learning, and can be interpreted as a negative result, that optimizing over $\beta$ does not lead to meaningful improvements in performance.

Abstract: Enhancing fairness in machine learning (ML) systems is increasingly important nowadays. While current research focuses on assistant tools for ML pipelines to promote fairness within them, we argue that: 1) The significance of properly defined fairness measures remains underestimated; and 2) Fairness research in ML should integrate societal considerations. The reasons include that detecting discrimination is critical due to the widespread deployment of ML systems and that human-AI feedback loops amplify biases, even when only small social and political biases persist.

arXiv:2506.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on knowledge graph tasks such as link prediction. However, interpreting GNN predictions remains a challenging open problem. While many GNN explainability methods have been proposed for node or graph-level tasks, approaches for generating explanations for link predictions in heterogeneous settings are limited. In this paper, we propose RAW-Explainer, a novel framework designed to generate connected, concise, and thus interpretable subgraph explanations for link prediction. Our method leverages the heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs to identify connected subgraphs that serve as patterns of factual explanation via a random walk objective. Unlike existing methods tailored to knowledge graphs, our approach employs a neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, which significantly speeds up the production of collective explanations. Furthermore, RAW-Explainer is designed to overcome the distribution shift issue when evaluating the quality of an explanatory subgraph which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full graph, by proposing a robust evaluator that generalizes to the subgraph distribution. Extensive quantitative results on real-world knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a balance between explanation quality and computational efficiency.

arXiv:2506.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has questioned the reliability of graph learning benchmarks, citing concerns around task design, methodological rigor, and data suitability. In this extended abstract, we contribute to this discussion by focusing on evaluation strategies in Temporal Link Prediction (TLP). We observe that current evaluation protocols are often affected by one or more of the following issues: (1) inconsistent sampled metrics, (2) reliance on hard negative sampling often introduced as a means to improve robustness, and (3) metrics that implicitly assume equal base probabilities across source nodes by combining predictions. We support these claims through illustrative examples and connections to longstanding concerns in the recommender systems community. Our ongoing work aims to systematically characterize these problems and explore alternatives that can lead to more robust and interpretable evaluation. We conclude with a discussion of potential directions for improving the reliability of TLP benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Sparse Interpolated Mixture-of-Experts (SIMoE) instruction-tuning, an end-to-end algorithm designed to fine-tune a dense pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) into a MoE-style model that possesses capabilities in multiple specialized domains. During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint, with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM's parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router network, leveraging rich cross-expert knowledge for superior downstream generalization that surpasses existing baselines. Empirically, SIMoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on common instruction-tuning benchmarks while maintaining an optimal performance-compute trade-off compared to all baselines.

<title>Semivalue-based data valuation is arbitrary and gameable</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game-theoretic notion of the semivalue offers a popular framework for credit attribution and data valuation in machine learning. Semivalues have been proposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as determining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or filtering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on the specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar score. While it is broadly agreed that this utility function arises from a composition of a learning algorithm and a performance metric, its actual instantiation involves numerous subtle modeling choices. We argue that this underspecification leads to varying degrees of arbitrariness in semivalue-based valuations. Small, but arguably reasonable changes to the utility function can induce substantial shifts in valuations across datapoints. Moreover, these valuation methodologies are also often gameable: low-cost adversarial strategies exist to exploit this ambiguity and systematically redistribute value among datapoints. Through theoretical constructions and empirical examples, we demonstrate that a bad-faith valuator can manipulate utility specifications to favor preferred datapoints, and that a good-faith valuator is left without principled guidance to justify any particular specification. These vulnerabilities raise ethical and epistemic concerns about the use of semivalues in several applications. We conclude by highlighting the burden of justification that semivalue-based approaches place on modelers and discuss important considerations for identifying appropriate uses.

arXiv:2506.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success, yet its application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by a lack of robustness to environmental uncertainties. To solve this challenge, some robust RL algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.

Abstract: Implicit Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning (HITL-RL) is a methodology that integrates passive human feedback into autonomous agent training while minimizing human workload. However, existing methods often rely on active instruction, requiring participants to teach an agent through unnatural expression or gesture. We introduce NEURO-LOOP, an implicit feedback framework that utilizes the intrinsic human reward system to drive human-agent interaction. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a critical first step in the NEURO-LOOP framework: mapping brain signals to agent performance. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we design a dataset to enable future research using passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning. Participants are instructed to observe or guide a reinforcement learning agent in its environment while signals from the prefrontal cortex are collected. We conclude that a relationship between fNIRS data and agent performance exists using classical machine learning techniques. Finally, we highlight the potential that neural interfaces may offer to future applications of human-agent interaction, assistive AI, and adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Many real-world physics and engineering problems arise in geometrically complex domains discretized by meshes for numerical simulations. The nodes of these potentially irregular meshes naturally form point clouds whose limited tractability poses significant challenges for learning mappings via machine learning models. To address this, we introduce a novel and parameter-free encoding scheme that aggregates footprints of points onto grid vertices and yields information-rich grid representations of the topology. Such structured representations are well-suited for standard convolution and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) operations and enable efficient learning of mappings between encoded input-output pairs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we integrate our encoder with a uniquely designed UNet (E-UNet) and benchmark its performance against Fourier- and transformer-based models across diverse 2D and 3D problems where we analyze the performance in terms of predictive accuracy, data efficiency, and noise robustness. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our encoding scheme in various mapping tasks including recovering full point cloud responses from partial observations. Our proposed framework offers a practical alternative to both primitive and computationally intensive encoding schemes; supporting broad adoption in computational science applications involving mesh-based simulations.

arXiv:2506.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time series forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear relationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from both time and frequency domains, we propose the $\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains, we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.

Abstract: Notification recommendation systems are critical to driving user engagement on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Designing such systems involves integrating heterogeneous signals across domains, capturing temporal dynamics, and optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex interactions in such environments. In this paper, we present a cross-domain GNN-based system deployed at LinkedIn that unifies user, content, and activity signals into a single, large-scale graph. By training on this cross-domain structure, our model significantly outperforms single-domain baselines on key tasks, including click-through rate (CTR) prediction and professional engagement. We introduce architectural innovations including temporal modeling and multi-task learning, which further enhance performance. Deployed in LinkedIn's notification system, our approach led to a 0.10% lift in weekly active users and a 0.62% improvement in CTR. We detail our graph construction process, model design, training pipeline, and both offline and online evaluations. Our work demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of cross-domain GNNs in real-world, high-impact applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is playing an increasingly important role in fields such as robotic control and autonomous driving. However, the gap between simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap. The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.

<title>Free Privacy Protection for Wireless Federated Learning: Enjoy It or Suffer from It?</title>

Abstract: Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards, e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies (\lambda,\epsilon)-R\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection.

arXiv:2506.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by 75%.

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction remains a central challenge in temporal graph learning, particularly in designing models that are both effective and practical for real-world deployment. Existing approaches often rely on complex neural architectures, which are computationally intensive and difficult to interpret.
  In this work, we build on the strong recurrence-based foundation of the EdgeBank baseline, by supplementing it with inductive capabilities. We do so by leveraging the predictive power of non-learnable signals from two complementary perspectives: historical edge recurrence, as captured by EdgeBank, and global node popularity, as introduced in the PopTrack model. We propose t-CoMem, a lightweight memory module that tracks temporal co-occurrence patterns and neighborhood activity. Building on this, we introduce Base3, an interpolation-based model that fuses EdgeBank, PopTrack, and t-CoMem into a unified scoring framework. This combination effectively bridges local and global temporal dynamics -- repetition, popularity, and context -- without relying on training. Evaluated on the Temporal Graph Benchmark, Base3 achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art deep models, even outperforming them on some datasets. Importantly, it considerably improves on existing baselines' performance under more realistic and challenging negative sampling strategies -- offering a simple yet robust alternative for temporal graph learning.

Abstract: This paper addresses online learning with ``corrupted'' feedback. Our learner is provided with potentially corrupted gradients $\tilde g_t$ instead of the ``true'' gradients $g_t$. We make no assumptions about how the corruptions arise: they could be the result of outliers, mislabeled data, or even malicious interference. We focus on the difficult ``unconstrained'' setting in which our algorithm must maintain low regret with respect to any comparison point $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$. The unconstrained setting is significantly more challenging as existing algorithms suffer extremely high regret even with very tiny amounts of corruption (which is not true in the case of a bounded domain). Our algorithms guarantee regret $ \|u\|G (\sqrt{T} + k) $ when $G \ge \max_t \|g_t\|$ is known, where $k$ is a measure of the total amount of corruption. When $G$ is unknown we incur an extra additive penalty of $(\|u\|^2+G^2) k$.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions, fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling, capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds, power grids and traffic networks.However, the inherent complexity and dynamics of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo

Abstract: Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources. Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called \textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts. Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos, where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to small perturbations, evolves around zero over time.
  Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular, we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by about $96\%$.

<title>Flow-Based Policy for Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: We present \textbf{FlowRL}, a novel framework for online reinforcement learning that integrates flow-based policy representation with Wasserstein-2-regularized optimization. We argue that in addition to training signals, enhancing the expressiveness of the policy class is crucial for the performance gains in RL. Flow-based generative models offer such potential, excelling at capturing complex, multimodal action distributions. However, their direct application in online RL is challenging due to a fundamental objective mismatch: standard flow training optimizes for static data imitation, while RL requires value-based policy optimization through a dynamic buffer, leading to difficult optimization landscapes. FlowRL first models policies via a state-dependent velocity field, generating actions through deterministic ODE integration from noise. We derive a constrained policy search objective that jointly maximizes Q through the flow policy while bounding the Wasserstein-2 distance to a behavior-optimal policy implicitly derived from the replay buffer. This formulation effectively aligns the flow optimization with the RL objective, enabling efficient and value-aware policy learning despite the complexity of the policy class. Empirical evaluations on DMControl and Humanoidbench demonstrate that FlowRL achieves competitive performance in online reinforcement learning benchmarks.

<title>TrojanTO: Action-Level Backdoor Attacks against Trajectory Optimization Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse TO model architectures.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black box problems where evaluation is expensive and, therefore, design-evaluation pairs (i.e., observations) are few. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where evaluation is cheaper and, thus, observations are more plentiful. An impediment to scaling BO to many observations, $N$, is the $O(N^3)$ scaling of a na{\"i}ve query of the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. Modern implementations reduce this to $O(N^2)$, but the GP remains a bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a surrogate that estimates function values and epistemic uncertainty from $K$ nearest-neighbor observations. ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting, leaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we employ an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between predicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method with our Pareto-based alternative. We demonstrate numerically that TuRBO-ENN can reduce the time to generate proposals by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO and scales to thousands of observations.

<title>PDCNet: a benchmark and general deep learning framework for activity prediction of peptide-drug conjugates</title>

Abstract: Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of these conjugates. To this end, we carefully design and construct a benchmark PDCs dataset compiled from literature-derived collections and PDCdb database, and then develop PDCNet, the first unified deep learning framework for forecasting the activity of PDCs. The architecture systematically captures the complex factors underlying anticancer decisions of PDCs in real-word scenarios through a multi-level feature fusion framework that collaboratively characterizes and learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA scores of 0.9213, 0.7656, 0.7071 and 0.8388 for the test set, outperforming eight established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis and external independent testing, further confirm the superiority, robustness, and usability of the PDCNet architecture. We anticipate that PDCNet represents a novel paradigm, incorporating both a benchmark dataset and advanced models, which can accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

<title>Enhancing Rating-Based Reinforcement Learning to Effectively Leverage Feedback from Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as it often requires extensive human effort and domain expertise. While RL from human feedback has been successful in aligning agents with human intent, acquiring high-quality feedback is costly and labor-intensive, limiting its scalability. Recent advancements in foundation models present a promising alternative--leveraging AI-generated feedback to reduce reliance on human supervision in reward learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce ERL-VLM, an enhanced rating-based RL method that effectively learns reward functions from AI feedback. Unlike prior methods that rely on pairwise comparisons, ERL-VLM queries large vision-language models (VLMs) for absolute ratings of individual trajectories, enabling more expressive feedback and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we propose key enhancements to rating-based RL, addressing instability issues caused by data imbalance and noisy labels. Through extensive experiments across both low-level and high-level control tasks, we demonstrate that ERL-VLM significantly outperforms existing VLM-based reward generation methods. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI feedback for scaling RL with minimal human intervention, paving the way for more autonomous and efficient reward learning.

<title>Private List Learnability vs. Online List Learnability</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12856</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the connection between differential privacy (DP) and online learning in the context of PAC list learning. In this setting, a $k$-list learner outputs a list of $k$ potential predictions for an instance $x$ and incurs a loss if the true label of $x$ is not included in the list. A basic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels states that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020)]. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this equivalence does not hold in the context of list learning. Specifically, we prove that, unlike in the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the classical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list learnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability. However, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary condition.
  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example showing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over $\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This leads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \emph{$k$-monotone dimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike the multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are finite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do not exhibit this relationship. We prove that a finite $k$-monotone dimension is another necessary condition for DP $k$-list learnability, alongside finite $k$-Littlestone dimension. Whether the finiteness of both dimensions implies private $k$-list learnability remains an open question.

arXiv:2506.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made inference efficiency a primary bottleneck in the practical deployment. To address this, semi-structured sparsity offers a promising solution by strategically retaining $N$ elements out of every $M$ weights, thereby enabling hardware-friendly acceleration and reduced memory. However, existing (N:M)-compatible approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based layerwise greedy search, which suffers from considerable errors, and gradient-driven combinatorial learning, which incurs prohibitive training costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel linear-space probabilistic framework named MaskPro, which aims to learn a prior categorical distribution for every $M$ consecutive weights and subsequently leverages this distribution to generate the (N:M)-sparsity throughout an $N$-way sampling without replacement. Furthermore, to mitigate the training instability induced by the high variance of policy gradients in the super large combinatorial space, we propose a novel update method by introducing a moving average tracker of loss residuals instead of vanilla loss. Finally, we conduct comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of MaskPro, as well as its excellent scalability in memory efficiency and exceptional robustness to data samples. Our code is available at https://github.com/woodenchild95/Maskpro.git.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task with numerous applications across diverse fields. Popular algorithms such as k-means often struggle with outliers or imbalances, leading to distorted centroids and suboptimal partitions. We introduce K-Sil, a silhouette-guided refinement of the k-means algorithm that weights points based on their silhouette scores, prioritizing well-clustered instances while suppressing borderline or noisy regions. The algorithm emphasizes user-specified silhouette aggregation metrics: macro-, micro-averaged or a combination, through self-tuning weighting schemes, supported by appropriate sampling strategies and scalable approximations. These components ensure computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse dataset geometries. Theoretical guarantees establish centroid convergence, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates statistically significant improvements in silhouette scores over k-means and two other instance-weighted k-means variants. These results establish K-Sil as a principled alternative for applications demanding high-quality, well-separated clusters.

Abstract: We analyzes the logit dynamics of softmax policy gradient methods. We derive the exact formula for the L2 norm of the logit update vector: $$ \|\Delta \mathbf{z}\|_2 \propto \sqrt{1-2P_c + C(P)} $$ This equation demonstrates that update magnitudes are determined by the chosen action's probability ($P_c$) and the policy's collision probability ($C(P)$), a measure of concentration inversely related to entropy. Our analysis reveals an inherent self-regulation mechanism where learning vigor is automatically modulated by policy confidence, providing a foundational insight into the stability and convergence of these methods.

Abstract: Jailbreaks pose an imminent threat to ensuring the safety of modern AI systems by enabling users to disable safeguards and elicit unsafe information. Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the source model where the only target model responses used to train the source model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in contextual representations computed by models.

Abstract: In this work, a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) based algorithm is used for simulation of nonlinear 1D and 2D Burgers' type models. This scheme relies on a neural network built to approximate the problem solution and use a trial function that meets the initial data and boundary criteria. First of all, a brief mathematical formulation of the problem and the structure of PINNs, including the neural network architecture, loss construction, and training methodology is described. Finally, the algorithm is demonstrated with five test problems involving variations of the 1D coupled, 2D single and 2D coupled Burgers' models. We compare the PINN-based solutions with exact results to assess accuracy and convergence of the developed algorithm. The results demonstrate that PINNs may faithfully replicate nonlinear PDE solutions and offer competitive performance in terms of inaccuracy and flexibility. This work demonstrates the potential of PINNs as a reliable approach to solving complex time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Recent work on neural scaling laws demonstrates that model performance scales predictably with compute budget, model size, and dataset size. In this work, we develop scaling laws based on problem complexity. We analyze two fundamental complexity measures: solution space size and representation space size. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a case study, we show that combinatorial optimization promotes smooth cost trends, and therefore meaningful scaling laws can be obtained even in the absence of an interpretable loss. We then show that suboptimality grows predictably for fixed-size models when scaling the number of TSP nodes or spatial dimensions, independent of whether the model was trained with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on a static dataset. We conclude with an analogy to problem complexity scaling in local search, showing that a much simpler gradient descent of the cost landscape produces similar trends.

Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

Abstract: Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing distributional training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that influence functions (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation; without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.

<title>Differentially Private Bilevel Optimization: Efficient Algorithms with Near-Optimal Rates</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is \textit{convex}, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy, covering both empirical and population-level loss. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM and stochastic convex optimization (SCO), up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the \textit{non-convex} setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.

Abstract: With the growing prominence of antibody-based therapeutics, antibody engineering has gained increasing attention as a critical area of research and development. Recent progress in transformer-based protein large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising applications in protein sequence design and structural prediction. Moreover, the availability of large-scale antibody datasets such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database has opened new avenues for the development of LLMs specialized for processing antibody sequences. Among these, RoBERTa has demonstrated improved performance relative to BERT, while maintaining a smaller parameter count (125M) compared to the BERT-based protein model, ProtBERT (420M). This reduced model size enables more efficient deployment in antibody-related applications. However, despite the numerous advantages of the RoBERTa architecture, antibody-specific foundational models built upon it have remained inaccessible to the research community. In this study, we introduce Ab-RoBERTa, a RoBERTa-based antibody-specific LLM, which is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/mogam-ai/Ab-RoBERTa. This resource is intended to support a wide range of antibody-related research applications including paratope prediction or humanness assessment.

Abstract: Geometrical interpretations of deep learning models offer insightful perspectives into their underlying mathematical structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages differential geometry, particularly concepts from Riemannian geometry, to integrate multiple models into a unified transfer learning framework. By aligning the Ricci curvature of latent space of individual models, we construct an interrelated architecture, namely Geometric Embedding Alignment via cuRvature matching in transfer learning (GEAR), which ensures comprehensive geometric representation across datapoints. This framework enables the effective aggregation of knowledge from diverse sources, thereby improving performance on target tasks. We evaluate our model on 23 molecular task pairs sourced from various domains and demonstrate significant performance gains over existing benchmark model under both random (14.4%) and scaffold (8.3%) data splits.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models are highly overparameterized, resulting in large sets of parameter configurations that yield the same outputs. A significant portion of this redundancy is explained by symmetries in the parameter space--transformations that leave the network function unchanged. These symmetries shape the loss landscape and constrain learning dynamics, offering a new lens for understanding optimization, generalization, and model complexity that complements existing theory of deep learning. This survey provides an overview of parameter space symmetry. We summarize existing literature, uncover connections between symmetry and learning theory, and identify gaps and opportunities in this emerging field.

Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aim to model users' evolving preferences by capturing patterns in their historical interactions. Recent advances in this area have leveraged deep neural networks and attention mechanisms to effectively represent sequential behaviors and time-sensitive interests. In this work, we propose C-TLSAN (Content-Enhanced Time-Aware Long- and Short-Term Attention Network), an extension of the TLSAN architecture that jointly models long- and short-term user preferences while incorporating semantic content associated with items, such as product descriptions.
  C-TLSAN enriches the recommendation pipeline by embedding textual content linked to users' historical interactions directly into both long-term and short-term attention layers. This allows the model to learn from both behavioral patterns and rich item content, enhancing user and item representations across temporal dimensions. By fusing sequential signals with textual semantics, our approach improves the expressiveness and personalization capacity of recommendation systems.
  We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale Amazon datasets, benchmarking C-TLSAN against state-of-the-art baselines, including recent sequential recommenders based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which represent interaction history and predictions in text form. Empirical results demonstrate that C-TLSAN consistently outperforms strong baselines in next-item prediction tasks. Notably, it improves AUC by 1.66%, Recall@10 by 93.99%, and Precision@10 by 94.80% on average over the best-performing baseline (TLSAN) across 10 Amazon product categories. These results highlight the value of integrating content-aware enhancements into temporal modeling frameworks for sequential recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/booml247/cTLSAN.

Abstract: Time series forecasting underpins vital decision-making across various sectors, yet raw predictions from sophisticated models often harbor systematic errors and biases. We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework, pioneering its systematic synopsis. Unlike conventional Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) methods, FTO explicitly refines forecasts through optimization techniques such as ensemble methods, meta-learners, and uncertainty adjustments. Furthermore, deep learning and large language models have established superiority over traditional parametric forecasting models for most enterprise applications. This paper surveys significant advancements from 2016 to 2025, analyzing mainstream deep learning FTO architectures. Focusing on real-world applications in operations management, we demonstrate FTO's crucial role in enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and decision efficacy. Our study establishes foundational guidelines for future forecasting methodologies, bridging theory and operational practicality.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

<title>The Space Complexity of Learning-Unlearning Algorithms</title>

arXiv:2506.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the memory complexity of machine unlearning algorithms that provide strong data deletion guarantees to the users. Formally, consider an algorithm for a particular learning task that initially receives a training dataset. Then, after learning, it receives data deletion requests from a subset of users (of arbitrary size), and the goal of unlearning is to perform the task as if the learner never received the data of deleted users. In this paper, we ask how many bits of storage are needed to be able to delete certain training samples at a later time. We focus on the task of realizability testing, where the goal is to check whether the remaining training samples are realizable within a given hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\).
  Toward that end, we first provide a negative result showing that the VC dimension is not a characterization of the space complexity of unlearning. In particular, we provide a hypothesis class with constant VC dimension (and Littlestone dimension), but for which any unlearning algorithm for realizability testing needs to store \(\Omega(n)\)-bits, where \(n\) denotes the size of the initial training dataset. In fact, we provide a stronger separation by showing that for any hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\), the amount of information that the learner needs to store, so as to perform unlearning later, is lower bounded by the \textit{eluder dimension} of \(\mathcal{H}\), a combinatorial notion always larger than the VC dimension. We complement the lower bound with an upper bound in terms of the star number of the underlying hypothesis class, albeit in a stronger ticketed-memory model proposed by Ghazi et al. (2023). Since the star number for a hypothesis class is never larger than its Eluder dimension, our work highlights a fundamental separation between central and ticketed memory models for machine unlearning.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models generate samples by learning to reverse a noise-injection process that transforms data into noise. Reformulating this reverse process as a deterministic probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) enables efficient sampling using high-order solvers, often requiring only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ steps. Since the score function is typically approximated by a neural network, analyzing the interaction between its regularity, approximation error, and numerical integration error is key to understanding the overall sampling accuracy. In this work, we continue our analysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods derived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \geq 1$. Under the assumption that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we develop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the total variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data distribution can be bounded above by \begin{align*}
  O\bigl(d^{\frac{7}{4}}\varepsilon_{\text{score}}^{\frac{1}{2}} +d(dH_{\max})^p\bigr), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon^2_{\text{score}}$ denotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data dimension and $H_{\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver. We numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets, confirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score function remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for general forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules.

<title>CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in graph representation learning by integrating graph structure and node features. Existing GNNs, unfortunately, fail to account for the uncertainty of class probabilities that vary with the depth of the model, leading to unreliable and risky predictions in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel Evidence Fusing Graph Neural Network (EFGNN for short) to achieve trustworthy prediction, enhance node classification accuracy, and make explicit the risk of wrong predictions. In particular, we integrate the evidence theory with multi-hop propagation-based GNN architecture to quantify the prediction uncertainty of each node with the consideration of multiple receptive fields. Moreover, a parameter-free cumulative belief fusion (CBF) mechanism is developed to leverage the changes in prediction uncertainty and fuse the evidence to improve the trustworthiness of the final prediction. To effectively optimize the EFGNN model, we carefully design a joint learning objective composed of evidence cross-entropy, dissonance coefficient, and false confident penalty. The experimental results on various datasets and theoretical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and trustworthiness, as well as its robustness to potential attacks. The source code of EFGNN is available at https://github.com/Shiy-Li/EFGNN.

<title>Fast and Furious Symmetric Learning in Zero-Sum Games: Gradient Descent as Fictitious Play</title>

arXiv:2506.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sublinear regret guarantees of two non-no-regret algorithms in zero-sum games: Fictitious Play, and Online Gradient Descent with constant stepsizes. In general adversarial online learning settings, both algorithms may exhibit instability and linear regret due to no regularization (Fictitious Play) or small amounts of regularization (Gradient Descent). However, their ability to obtain tighter regret bounds in two-player zero-sum games is less understood. In this work, we obtain strong new regret guarantees for both algorithms on a class of symmetric zero-sum games that generalize the classic three-strategy Rock-Paper-Scissors to a weighted, n-dimensional regime. Under symmetric initializations of the players' strategies, we prove that Fictitious Play with any tiebreaking rule has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, establishing a new class of games for which Karlin's Fictitious Play conjecture holds. Moreover, by leveraging a connection between the geometry of the iterates of Fictitious Play and Gradient Descent in the dual space of payoff vectors, we prove that Gradient Descent, for almost all symmetric initializations, obtains a similar $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when its stepsize is a sufficiently large constant. For Gradient Descent, this establishes the first "fast and furious" behavior (i.e., sublinear regret without time-vanishing stepsizes) for zero-sum games larger than 2x2.

Abstract: Recent research on deep graph learning has shifted from static to dynamic graphs, motivated by the evolving behaviors observed in complex real-world systems. However, the temporal extension in dynamic graphs poses significant data efficiency challenges, including increased data volume, high spatiotemporal redundancy, and reliance on costly dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs). To alleviate the concerns, we pioneer the study of dynamic graph condensation (DGC), which aims to substantially reduce the scale of dynamic graphs for data-efficient DGNN training. Accordingly, we propose DyGC, a novel framework that condenses the real dynamic graph into a compact version while faithfully preserving the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics. Specifically, to endow synthetic graphs with realistic evolving structures, a novel spiking structure generation mechanism is introduced. It draws on the dynamic behavior of spiking neurons to model temporally-aware connectivity in dynamic graphs. Given the tightly coupled spatiotemporal dependencies, DyGC proposes a tailored distribution matching approach that first constructs a semantically rich state evolving field for dynamic graphs, and then performs fine-grained spatiotemporal state alignment to guide the optimization of the condensed graph. Experiments across multiple dynamic graph datasets and representative DGNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of DyGC. Notably, our method retains up to 96.2% DGNN performance with only 0.5% of the original graph size, and achieves up to 1846 times training speedup.

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text, images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT, combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

<title>Honesty in Causal Forests: When It Helps and When It Hurts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal forests are increasingly used to personalize decisions based on estimated treatment effects. A distinctive modeling choice in this method is honest estimation: using separate data for splitting and for estimating effects within leaves. This practice is the default in most implementations and is widely seen as desirable for causal inference. But we show that honesty can hurt the accuracy of individual-level effect estimates. The reason is a classic bias-variance trade-off: honesty reduces variance by preventing overfitting, but increases bias by limiting the model's ability to discover and exploit meaningful heterogeneity in treatment effects. This trade-off depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): honesty helps when effect heterogeneity is hard to detect (low SNR), but hurts when the signal is strong (high SNR). In essence, honesty acts as a form of regularization, and like any regularization choice, it should be guided by out-of-sample performance, not adopted by default.

Abstract: One of the key challenges that Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces is its limited capability to adapt to a change of data distribution caused by uncertainties. This challenge arises especially in RL systems using deep neural networks as decision makers or policies, which are prone to overfitting after prolonged training on fixed environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Gaussian Process Diffusion Policy (GPDP), a new algorithm that integrates diffusion models and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent the policy. GPR guides diffusion models to generate actions that maximize learned Q-function, resembling the policy improvement in RL. Furthermore, the kernel-based nature of GPR enhances the policy's exploration efficiency under distribution shifts at test time, increasing the chance of discovering new behaviors and mitigating overfitting. Simulation results on the Walker2d benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under distribution shift condition by achieving around 67.74% to 123.18% improvement in the RL's objective function while maintaining comparable performance under normal conditions.

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for predictive policing and spatial criminology.

Abstract: Identifying causative genes from patient phenotypes remains a significant challenge in precision medicine, with important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders. We propose a novel graph-based approach for predicting causative genes from patient phenotypes, with or without an available list of candidate genes, by integrating a rare disease knowledge graph (KG). Our model, combining graph neural networks and transformers, achieves substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art. On the real-world MyGene2 dataset, it attains a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 24.64\% and nDCG@100 of 33.64\%, surpassing the best baseline (SHEPHERD) at 19.02\% MRR and 30.54\% nDCG@100. We perform extensive ablation studies to validate the contribution of each model component. Notably, the approach generalizes to cases where only phenotypic data are available, addressing key challenges in clinical decision support when genomic information is incomplete.

Abstract: PDE-Constrained Optimization (PDECO) problems can be accelerated significantly by employing gradient-based methods with surrogate models like neural operators compared to traditional numerical solvers. However, this approach faces two key challenges: (1) **Data inefficiency**: Lack of efficient data sampling and effective training for neural operators, particularly for optimization purpose. (2) **Instability**: High risk of optimization derailment due to inaccurate neural operator predictions and gradients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework: (1) **Optimization-oriented training**: we leverage data from full steps of traditional optimization algorithms and employ a specialized training method for neural operators. (2) **Enhanced derivative learning**: We introduce a *Virtual-Fourier* layer to enhance derivative learning within the neural operator, a crucial aspect for gradient-based optimization. (3) **Hybrid optimization**: We implement a hybrid approach that integrates neural operators with numerical solvers, providing robust regularization for the optimization process. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in accurately learning operators and their derivatives. Furthermore, our hybrid optimization approach exhibits robust convergence.

Abstract: Data scarcity in African agriculture hampers machine learning (ML) model performance, limiting innovations in precision agriculture. The Synthetic Agriculture Data for Africa (SAGDA) library, a Python-based open-source toolkit, addresses this gap by generating, augmenting, and validating synthetic agricultural datasets. We present SAGDA's design and development practices, highlighting its core functions: generate, model, augment, validate, visualize, optimize, and simulate, as well as their roles in applications of ML for agriculture. Two use cases are detailed: yield prediction enhanced via data augmentation, and multi-objective NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) fertilizer recommendation. We conclude with future plans for expanding SAGDA's capabilities, underscoring the vital role of open-source, data-driven practices for African agriculture.

<title>Stochastic Multi-Objective Multi-Armed Bandits: Regret Definition and Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely applied to online optimization tasks that require balancing exploration and exploitation. In practical scenarios, these tasks often involve multiple conflicting objectives, giving rise to multi-objective multi-armed bandits (MO-MAB). Existing MO-MAB approaches predominantly rely on the Pareto regret metric introduced in \cite{drugan2013designing}. However, this metric has notable limitations, particularly in accounting for all Pareto-optimal arms simultaneously. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and comprehensive regret metric that ensures balanced performance across conflicting objectives. Additionally, we introduce the concept of \textit{Efficient Pareto-Optimal} arms, which are specifically designed for online optimization. Based on our new metric, we develop a two-phase MO-MAB algorithm that achieves sublinear regret for both Pareto-optimal and efficient Pareto-optimal arms.

<title>Federated ADMM from Bayesian Duality</title>

Abstract: ADMM is a popular method for federated deep learning which originated in the 1970s and, even though many new variants of it have been proposed since then, its core algorithmic structure has remained unchanged. Here, we take a major departure from the old structure and present a fundamentally new way to derive and extend federated ADMM. We propose to use a structure called Bayesian Duality which exploits a duality of the posterior distributions obtained by solving a variational-Bayesian reformulation of the original problem. We show that this naturally recovers the original ADMM when isotropic Gaussian posteriors are used, and yields non-trivial extensions for other posterior forms. For instance, full-covariance Gaussians lead to Newton-like variants of ADMM, while diagonal covariances result in a cheap Adam-like variant. This is especially useful to handle heterogeneity in federated deep learning, giving up to 7% accuracy improvements over recent baselines. Our work opens a new Bayesian path to improve primal-dual methods.

<title>CertDW: Towards Certified Dataset Ownership Verification via Conformal Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13160</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV) crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations. To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark (i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR, enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. Our codes are at \href{https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/CertDW}{GitHub}.

<title>Efficient Algorithms for Logistic Contextual Slate Bandits with Bandit Feedback</title>

arXiv:2506.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Logistic Contextual Slate Bandit problem, where, at each round, an agent selects a slate of $N$ items from an exponentially large set (of size $2^{\Omega(N)}$) of candidate slates provided by the environment. A single binary reward, determined by a logistic model, is observed for the chosen slate. Our objective is to develop algorithms that maximize cumulative reward over $T$ rounds while maintaining low per-round computational costs. We propose two algorithms, Slate-GLM-OFU and Slate-GLM-TS, that accomplish this goal. These algorithms achieve $N^{O(1)}$ per-round time complexity via local planning (independent slot selections), and low regret through global learning (joint parameter estimation). We provide theoretical and empirical evidence supporting these claims. Under a well-studied diversity assumption, we prove that Slate-GLM-OFU incurs only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Extensive experiments across a wide range of synthetic settings demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines, achieving both the lowest regret and the fastest runtime. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to select in-context examples in prompts of Language Models for solving binary classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our approach achieves competitive test accuracy, making it a viable alternative in practical scenarios.

Abstract: The pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm has driven significant advances across domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision, with representative pretraining paradigms such as masked language modeling and next-token prediction. However, in molecular representation learning, the task design remains largely limited to node-level denoising, which is effective at modeling local atomic environments, yet maybe insufficient for capturing the global molecular structure required by graph-level property prediction tasks, such as energy estimation and molecular regression. In this work, we present GeoRecon, a novel graph-level pretraining framework that shifts the focus from individual atoms to the molecule as an integrated whole. GeoRecon introduces a graph-level reconstruction task: during pretraining, the model is trained to generate an informative graph representation capable of accurately guiding reconstruction of the molecular geometry. This encourages the model to learn coherent, global structural features rather than isolated atomic details. Without relying on additional supervision or external data, GeoRecon outperforms node-centric baselines on multiple molecular benchmarks (e.g., QM9, MD17), demonstrating the benefit of incorporating graph-level reconstruction for learning more holistic and geometry-aware molecular embeddings.

<title>Dynamic Context-oriented Decomposition for Task-aware Low-rank Adaptation with Less Forgetting and Faster Convergence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13187</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM) and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM, our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA, and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library developed by Hugging Face.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for drug discovery. While recent deep learning approaches have demonstrated promising results, they often rely solely on structural features, overlooking valuable biochemical knowledge associated with binding affinity. To address this limitation, we propose KEPLA, a novel deep learning framework that explicitly integrates prior knowledge from Gene Ontology and ligand properties of proteins and ligands to enhance prediction performance. KEPLA takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input and optimizes two complementary objectives: (1) aligning global representations with knowledge graph relations to capture domain-specific biochemical insights, and (2) leveraging cross attention between local representations to construct fine-grained joint embeddings for prediction. Experiments on two benchmark datasets across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that KEPLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, interpretability analyses based on knowledge graph relations and cross attention maps provide valuable insights into the underlying predictive mechanisms.

arXiv:2506.13203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and head-mounted displays, are increasingly used for prolonged tasks like remote learning and work, but sustained interaction often leads to user fatigue, reducing efficiency and engagement. This study proposes a fatigue-aware adaptive interface system for wearable devices that leverages deep learning to analyze physiological data (e.g., heart rate, eye movement) and dynamically adjust interface elements to mitigate cognitive load. The system employs multimodal learning to process physiological and contextual inputs and reinforcement learning to optimize interface features like text size, notification frequency, and visual contrast. Experimental results show a 18% reduction in cognitive load and a 22% improvement in user satisfaction compared to static interfaces, particularly for users engaged in prolonged tasks. This approach enhances accessibility and usability in wearable computing environments.

<title>Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13206</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.

Abstract: We propose Polyra Swarms, a novel machine-learning approach that approximates shapes instead of functions. Our method enables general-purpose learning with very low bias. In particular, we show that depending on the task, Polyra Swarms can be preferable compared to neural networks, especially for tasks like anomaly detection. We further introduce an automated abstraction mechanism that simplifies the complexity of a Polyra Swarm significantly, enhancing both their generalization and transparency. Since Polyra Swarms operate on fundamentally different principles than neural networks, they open up new research directions with distinct strengths and limitations.

arXiv:2506.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network training is inherently sensitive to initialization and the randomness induced by stochastic gradient descent. However, it is unclear to what extent such effects lead to meaningfully different networks, either in terms of the models' weights or the underlying functions that were learned. In this work, we show that during the initial "chaotic" phase of training, even extremely small perturbations reliably causes otherwise identical training trajectories to diverge-an effect that diminishes rapidly over training time. We quantify this divergence through (i) $L^2$ distance between parameters, (ii) the loss barrier when interpolating between networks, (iii) $L^2$ and barrier between parameters after permutation alignment, and (iv) representational similarity between intermediate activations; revealing how perturbations across different hyperparameter or fine-tuning settings drive training trajectories toward distinct loss minima. Our findings provide insights into neural network training stability, with practical implications for fine-tuning, model merging, and diversity of model ensembles.

arXiv:2506.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.

<title>No-Regret Learning Under Adversarial Resource Constraints: A Spending Plan Is All You Need!</title>

arXiv:2506.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online decision making problems under resource constraints, where both reward and cost functions are drawn from distributions that may change adversarially over time. We focus on two canonical settings: $(i)$ online resource allocation where rewards and costs are observed before action selection, and $(ii)$ online learning with resource constraints where they are observed after action selection, under full feedback or bandit feedback. It is well known that achieving sublinear regret in these settings is impossible when reward and cost distributions may change arbitrarily over time. To address this challenge, we analyze a framework in which the learner is guided by a spending plan--a sequence prescribing expected resource usage across rounds. We design general (primal-)dual methods that achieve sublinear regret with respect to baselines that follow the spending plan. Crucially, the performance of our algorithms improves when the spending plan ensures a well-balanced distribution of the budget across rounds. We additionally provide a robust variant of our methods to handle worst-case scenarios where the spending plan is highly imbalanced. To conclude, we study the regret of our algorithms when competing against benchmarks that deviate from the prescribed spending plan.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific curriculum design.

<title>An Explainable and Interpretable Composite Indicator Based on Decision Rules</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13259</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite indicators are widely used to score or classify units evaluated on multiple criteria. Their construction involves aggregating criteria evaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In MCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple criteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the degree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential interactions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is essential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well as the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing explainable and interpretable composite indicators using "if..., then..." decision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of composite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical scores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal qualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into quantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in the form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is constructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units results from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision rules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the class assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected indicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale. Moreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units of interest.

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc. Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler choices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities, underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.

Abstract: Vine copulas are sophisticated models for multivariate distributions and are increasingly used in machine learning. To facilitate their integration into modern ML pipelines, we introduce the vine computational graph, a DAG that abstracts the multilevel vine structure and associated computations. On this foundation, we devise new algorithms for conditional sampling, efficient sampling-order scheduling, and constructing vine structures for customized conditioning variables. We implement these ideas in torchvinecopulib, a GPU-accelerated Python library built upon PyTorch, delivering improved scalability for fitting, sampling, and density evaluation. Our experiments illustrate how gradient flowing through the vine can improve Vine Copula Autoencoders and that incorporating vines for uncertainty quantification in deep learning can outperform MC-dropout, deep ensembles, and Bayesian Neural Networks in sharpness, calibration, and runtime. By recasting vine copula models as computational graphs, our work connects classical dependence modeling with modern deep-learning toolchains and facilitates the integration of state-of-the-art copula methods in modern machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Human intelligence emerges from the interaction of specialized brain networks, each dedicated to distinct cognitive functions such as language processing, logical reasoning, social understanding, and memory retrieval. Inspired by this biological observation, we introduce the Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo) architecture and training paradigm: a modular transformer-based language model with a training curriculum that encourages the emergence of functional specialization among different modules. Inspired by studies in neuroscience, we partition the layers of a pretrained transformer model into four expert modules, each corresponding to a well-studied cognitive brain network. Our Brain-Like model has three key benefits over the state of the art: First, the specialized experts are highly interpretable and functionally critical, where removing a module significantly impairs performance on domain-relevant benchmarks. Second, our model outperforms comparable baselines that lack specialization on seven reasoning benchmarks. And third, the model's behavior can be steered at inference time by selectively emphasizing certain expert modules (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over the style of its response. Our findings suggest that biologically inspired inductive biases involved in human cognition lead to significant modeling gains in interpretability, performance, and controllability.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.

<title>Learning to Explore in Diverse Reward Settings via Temporal-Difference-Error Maximization</title>

Abstract: Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) present a promising solution to restoring and decoding brain activity lost due to injury. However, patients with such neuroprosthetics suffer from permanent skull openings resulting from the devices' bulky wiring. This drives the development of wireless iBMIs, which demand low power consumption and small device footprint. Most recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been researched as potential candidates for low-power neural decoding. In this work, we present the next step of utilizing SNNs for such tasks, building on the recently published results of the 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding Challenge for Motor Control of non-Human Primates. We optimize our model architecture to exceed the existing state of the art on the Primate Reaching dataset while maintaining similar resource demand through various compression techniques. We further focus on implementing a realtime-capable version of the model and discuss the implications of this architecture. With this, we advance one step towards latency-free decoding of cortical spike trains using neuromorphic technology, ultimately improving the lives of millions of paralyzed patients.

<title>CALM: Consensus-Aware Localized Merging for Multi-Task Learning</title>

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate the strengths of multiple fine-tuned models into a unified model while preserving task-specific capabilities. Existing methods, represented by task arithmetic, are typically classified into global- and local-aware methods. However, global-aware methods inevitably cause parameter interference, while local-aware methods struggle to maintain the effectiveness of task-specific details in the merged model. To address these limitations, we propose a Consensus-Aware Localized Merging (CALM) method which incorporates localized information aligned with global task consensus, ensuring its effectiveness post-merging. CALM consists of three key components: (1) class-balanced entropy minimization sampling, providing a more flexible and reliable way to leverage unsupervised data; (2) an efficient-aware framework, selecting a small set of tasks for sequential merging with high scalability; (3) a consensus-aware mask optimization, aligning localized binary masks with global task consensus and merging them conflict-free. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our CALM, significantly outperforming existing methods and achieving performance close to traditional MTL.

Abstract: The high computational complexity and increasing parameter counts of deep neural networks pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or real-time systems. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient neural architecture where neurons are embedded in Euclidean space. During training, their positions are optimized and synaptic weights are determined as the inverse of the spatial distance between connected neurons. These distance-dependent wiring rules replace traditional learnable weight matrices and significantly reduce the number of parameters while introducing a biologically inspired inductive bias: connection strength decreases with spatial distance, reflecting the brain's embedding in three-dimensional space where connections tend to minimize wiring length. We validate this approach for both multi-layer perceptrons and spiking neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that these spatially embedded neural networks achieve a performance competitive with conventional architectures on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the models maintain performance even at pruning rates exceeding 80% sparsity, outperforming traditional networks with the same number of parameters under similar conditions. Finally, the spatial embedding framework offers an intuitive visualization of the network structure.

<title>Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Vibration-Based Predictive Maintenance</title>

Abstract: Advancements in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors enable sophisticated Predictive Maintenance (PM) with high temporal resolution. For cost-efficient solutions, vibration-based condition monitoring is especially of interest. However, analyzing high-resolution vibration data via traditional cloud approaches incurs significant energy and communication costs, hindering battery-powered edge deployments. This necessitates shifting intelligence to the sensor edge. Due to their event-driven nature, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising pathway toward energy-efficient on-device processing. This paper investigates a recurrent SNN for simultaneous regression (flow, pressure, pump speed) and multi-label classification (normal, overpressure, cavitation) for an industrial progressing cavity pump (PCP) using 3-axis vibration data. Furthermore, we provide energy consumption estimates comparing the SNN approach on conventional (x86, ARM) and neuromorphic (Loihi) hardware platforms. Results demonstrate high classification accuracy (>97%) with zero False Negative Rates for critical Overpressure and Cavitation faults. Smoothed regression outputs achieve Mean Relative Percentage Errors below 1% for flow and pump speed, approaching industrial sensor standards, although pressure prediction requires further refinement. Energy estimates indicate significant power savings, with the Loihi consumption (0.0032 J/inf) being up to 3 orders of magnitude less compared to the estimated x86 CPU (11.3 J/inf) and ARM CPU (1.18 J/inf) execution. Our findings underscore the potential of SNNs for multi-task PM directly on resource-constrained edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient industrial monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.

<title>The Price of Freedom: Exploring Expressivity and Runtime Tradeoffs in Equivariant Tensor Products</title>

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30\%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

<title>Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion Framework Based on Conditional Latent Generative Diffusion Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance plays a crucial role in lithological identification and subsurface structure interpretation. However, due to the inherently ill-posed nature of the inversion problem, directly estimating impedance from post-stack seismic data remains highly challenging. Recently, diffusion models have shown great potential in addressing such inverse problems due to their strong prior learning and generative capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing methods operate in the pixel domain and require multiple iterations, limiting their applicability to field data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel seismic acoustic impedance inversion framework based on a conditional latent generative diffusion model, where the inversion process is made in latent space. To avoid introducing additional training overhead when embedding conditional inputs, we design a lightweight wavelet-based module into the framework to project seismic data and reuse an encoder trained on impedance to embed low-frequency impedance into the latent space. Furthermore, we propose a model-driven sampling strategy during the inversion process of this framework to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of required diffusion steps. Numerical experiments on a synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high inversion accuracy and strong generalization capability within only a few diffusion steps. Moreover, application to field data reveals enhanced geological detail and higher consistency with well-log measurements, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning. Previous research has focused on learning-augmented $k$-means in Euclidean metrics, limiting its applicability to complex data representations. In this paper, we generalize learning-augmented $k$-clustering to operate on general metrics, enabling its application to graph-structured and non-Euclidean domains. Our framework also relaxes restrictive cluster size constraints, providing greater flexibility for datasets with imbalanced or unknown cluster distributions. Furthermore, we extend the hardness of query complexity to general metrics: under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), we show that any polynomial-time algorithm must perform approximately $\Omega(k / \alpha)$ queries to achieve a $(1 + \alpha)$-approximation. These contributions strengthen both the theoretical foundations and practical applicability of learning-augmented clustering, bridging gaps between traditional methods and real-world challenges.

arXiv:2506.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous stability framework for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) grounded in variational analysis, operator coercivity, and explicit perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual-based losses over sampled collocation points. We derive deterministic stability bounds that quantify how bounded perturbations in the network output propagate through both residual and supervised loss components. Probabilistic stability is established via McDiarmid's inequality, yielding non-asymptotic concentration bounds that link sampling variability to empirical loss fluctuations under minimal assumptions. Generalization from Sobolev-norm training loss to uniform approximation is analyzed using coercivity and Sobolev embeddings, leading to pointwise error control. The theoretical results apply to both scalar and vector-valued PDEs and cover composite loss formulations. Numerical experiments validate the perturbation sensitivity, sample complexity estimates, and Sobolev-to-uniform generalization bounds. This work provides a mathematically grounded and practically applicable stability framework for PINNs, clarifying the role of operator structure, sampling design, and functional regularity in robust training.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning but introduces new privacy and security challenges. We propose ByITFL and LoByITFL, two novel FL schemes that enhance resilience against Byzantine users while keeping the users' data private from eavesdroppers. To ensure privacy and Byzantine resilience, our schemes build on having a small representative dataset available to the federator and crafting a discriminator function allowing the mitigation of corrupt users' contributions. ByITFL employs Lagrange coded computing and re-randomization, making it the first Byzantine-resilient FL scheme with perfect Information-Theoretic (IT) privacy, though at the cost of a significant communication overhead. LoByITFL, on the other hand, achieves Byzantine resilience and IT privacy at a significantly reduced communication cost, but requires a Trusted Third Party, used only in a one-time initialization phase before training. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and Byzantine resilience, along with convergence guarantees and experimental results validating our findings.

arXiv:2506.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) focuses on optimizing makespan under deterministic constraints. Real-world production environments introduce additional complexities that cause traditional scheduling approaches to be less effective. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds potential in addressing these challenges, as it allows agents to learn adaptive scheduling strategies. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive, general-purpose frameworks for effectively training and evaluating RL agents under real-world constraints. To address this gap, we propose a modular framework that extends classical JSSP formulations by incorporating key \mbox{real-world} constraints inherent to the shopfloor, including transport logistics, buffer management, machine breakdowns, setup times, and stochastic processing conditions, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. The framework is a customizable solution that offers flexibility in defining problem instances and configuring simulation parameters, enabling adaptation to diverse production scenarios. A standardized interface ensures compatibility with various RL approaches, providing a robust environment for training RL agents and facilitating the standardized comparison of different scheduling methods under dynamic and uncertain conditions. We release JobShopLab as an open-source tool for both research and industrial applications, accessible at: https://github.com/proto-lab-ro/jobshoplab

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

<title>Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

Abstract: Generating rational and generally accurate responses to tasks, often accompanied by example demonstrations, highlights Large Language Model's (LLM's) remarkable In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities without requiring updates to the model's parameter space. Despite having an ongoing exploration focused on the inference from a document-level concept, its behavior in learning well-defined functions or relations in context needs a careful investigation. In this article, we present the performance of ICL on partially ordered relation by introducing the notion of inductively increasing complexity in prompts. In most cases, the saturated performance of the chosen metric indicates that while ICL offers some benefits, its effectiveness remains constrained as we increase the complexity in the prompts even in presence of sufficient demonstrative examples. The behavior is evident from our empirical findings and has further been theoretically justified in term of its implicit optimization process. The code is available \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICLonPartiallyOrderSet}{here}.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in medical research by mitigating privacy concerns and enabling large-scale patient data analysis. This study presents a beta-Variational Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Neural Network framework for generating synthetic Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms (AAA). Using a small real-world dataset, our approach extracts key anatomical features and captures complex statistical relationships within a compact disentangled latent space. To address data limitations, low-impact data augmentation based on Procrustes analysis was employed, preserving anatomical integrity. The generation strategies, both deterministic and stochastic, manage to enhance data diversity while ensuring realism. Compared to PCA-based approaches, our model performs more robustly on unseen data by capturing complex, nonlinear anatomical variations. This enables more comprehensive clinical and statistical analyses than the original dataset alone. The resulting synthetic AAA dataset preserves patient privacy while providing a scalable foundation for medical research, device testing, and computational modeling.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning. In this paper, we study the convergence of the adjoint gradient descent optimization method for training neural-network PDE models in the limit where both the number of hidden units and the training time tend to infinity. Specifically, for a general class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs with a neural network embedded in the source term, we prove convergence of the trained neural-network PDE solution to the target data (i.e., a global minimizer). The global convergence proof poses a unique mathematical challenge that is not encountered in finite-dimensional neural network convergence analyses due to (1) the neural network training dynamics involving a non-local neural network kernel operator in the infinite-width hidden layer limit where the kernel lacks a spectral gap for its eigenvalues and (2) the nonlinearity of the limit PDE system, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem, even in the infinite-width hidden layer limit (unlike in typical neual network training cases where the optimization problem becomes convex in the large neuron limit). The theoretical results are illustrated and empirically validated by numerical studies.

Abstract: We introduce xbench, a dynamic, profession-aligned evaluation suite designed to bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and real-world productivity. While existing benchmarks often focus on isolated technical skills, they may not accurately reflect the economic value agents deliver in professional settings. To address this, xbench targets commercially significant domains with evaluation tasks defined by industry professionals. Our framework creates metrics that strongly correlate with productivity value, enables prediction of Technology-Market Fit (TMF), and facilitates tracking of product capabilities over time. As our initial implementations, we present two benchmarks: Recruitment and Marketing. For Recruitment, we collect 50 tasks from real-world headhunting business scenarios to evaluate agents' abilities in company mapping, information retrieval, and talent sourcing. For Marketing, we assess agents' ability to match influencers with advertiser needs, evaluating their performance across 50 advertiser requirements using a curated pool of 836 candidate influencers. We present initial evaluation results for leading contemporary agents, establishing a baseline for these professional domains. Our continuously updated evalsets and evaluations are available at https://xbench.org.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are essential for supporting a wide range of activities and decision-making processes, as well as mitigating the impacts of adverse weather events. While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.

<title>We Should Identify and Mitigate Third-Party Safety Risks in MCP-Powered Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a experience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven learning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However, as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2) We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial. (3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more researchers to join this important research direction.

Abstract: Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically leverages replay buffers for reusing past experiences during learning. This can help improve sample efficiency when the collected data is informative and aligned with the learning objectives; when that is not the case, it can have the effect of "polluting" the replay buffer with data which can exacerbate optimization challenges in addition to wasting environment interactions due to wasteful sampling. We argue that sampling these uninformative and wasteful transitions can be avoided by addressing the sunk cost fallacy, which, in the context of deep RL, is the tendency towards continuing an episode until termination. To address this, we propose learn to stop (LEAST), a lightweight mechanism that enables strategic early episode termination based on Q-value and gradient statistics, which helps agents recognize when to terminate unproductive episodes early. We demonstrate that our method improves learning efficiency on a variety of RL algorithms, evaluated on both the MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks.

<title>A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction</title>

Abstract: Human activity intensity prediction is a crucial to many location-based services. Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints of spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial correlation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to integrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating constraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the likelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial interactions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention matrices. The underlying law of human activity can be explicitly modeled by the proposed adaptive gravity model. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer structure is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws. This work provides a novel insight into integrating physical laws with deep learning for spatiotemporal predictive learning.

<title>Hybrid Meta-learners for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>

Abstract: Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational data involves modeling decisions that differ from supervised learning, particularly concerning how to regularize model complexity. Previous approaches can be grouped into two primary "meta-learner" paradigms that impose distinct inductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate potential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their difference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize estimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently outperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when the PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is simpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid Learner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between the direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand. The H-learner achieves this by learning intermediate functions whose difference closely approximates the CATE without necessarily requiring accurate individual approximations of the POs themselves. We demonstrate empirically that intentionally allowing suboptimal fits to the POs improves the bias-variance tradeoff in estimating CATE. Experiments conducted on semi-synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets illustrate that the H-learner consistently operates at the Pareto frontier, effectively combining the strengths of both direct and indirect meta-learners.

<title>What Happens During the Loss Plateau? Understanding Abrupt Learning in Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Transformers on algorithmic tasks frequently demonstrates an intriguing abrupt learning phenomenon: an extended performance plateau followed by a sudden, sharp improvement. This work investigates the underlying mechanisms for such dynamics, primarily in shallow Transformers. We reveal that during the plateau, the model often develops an interpretable partial solution while simultaneously exhibiting a strong repetition bias in their outputs. This output degeneracy is accompanied by internal representation collapse, where hidden states across different tokens become nearly parallel. We further identify the slow learning of optimal attention maps as a key bottleneck. Hidden progress in attention configuration during the plateau precedes the eventual rapid convergence, and directly intervening on attention significantly alters plateau duration and the severity of repetition bias and representational collapse. We validate that these identified phenomena-repetition bias and representation collapse-are not artifacts of toy setups but also manifest in the early pre-training stage of large language models like Pythia and OLMo.

<title>Meta-learning how to Share Credit among Macro-Actions</title>

Abstract: One proposed mechanism to improve exploration in reinforcement learning is through the use of macro-actions. Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the naive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather the opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful macros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively environment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different perspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between reducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size of the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action as independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and making typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we propose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between actions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by reducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving exploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned jointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy looking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment. Our results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all environments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is transferable to related environments. We believe this work is a small but important step towards understanding how the similarity-imposed geometry on the action space can be exploited to improve credit assignment and exploration, therefore making learning more effective.

<title>Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning</title>

Abstract: Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.

<title>TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

Abstract: We characterize the effectiveness of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) under machine unlearning scheme, where unlearning forget signals interferes with learning retain signals. While previous work prove that SAM improves generalization with noise memorization prevention, we show that SAM abandons such denoising property when fitting the forget set, leading to various test error bounds depending on signal strength. We further characterize the signal surplus of SAM in the order of signal strength, which enables learning from less retain signals to maintain model performance and putting more weight on unlearning the forget set. Empirical studies show that SAM outperforms SGD with relaxed requirement for retain signals and can enhance various unlearning methods either as pretrain or unlearn algorithm. Observing that overfitting can benefit more stringent sample-specific unlearning, we propose Sharp MinMax, which splits the model into two to learn retain signals with SAM and unlearn forget signals with sharpness maximization, achieving best performance. Extensive experiments show that SAM enhances unlearning across varying difficulties measured by data memorization, yielding decreased feature entanglement between retain and forget sets, stronger resistance to membership inference attacks, and a flatter loss landscape.

Abstract: Contrastive self-supervised learning based on point-wise comparisons has been widely studied for vision tasks. In the visual cortex of the brain, neuronal responses to distinct stimulus classes are organized into geometric structures known as neural manifolds. Accurate classification of stimuli can be achieved by effectively separating these manifolds, akin to solving a packing problem. We introduce Contrastive Learning As Manifold Packing (CLAMP), a self-supervised framework that recasts representation learning as a manifold packing problem. CLAMP introduces a loss function inspired by the potential energy of short-range repulsive particle systems, such as those encountered in the physics of simple liquids and jammed packings. In this framework, each class consists of sub-manifolds embedding multiple augmented views of a single image. The sizes and positions of the sub-manifolds are dynamically optimized by following the gradient of a packing loss. This approach yields interpretable dynamics in the embedding space that parallel jamming physics, and introduces geometrically meaningful hyperparameters within the loss function. Under the standard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only a linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that neural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are effectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the potential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs. While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification). Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning, while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling. Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

arXiv:2506.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces MARCO (Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning with Conformal Optimization), a novel hardware-aware framework for efficient neural architecture search (NAS) targeting resource-constrained edge devices. By significantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict hardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and CAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its unique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal Prediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for deploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet approaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task into a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The HCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer bit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal within a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key innovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides statistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune unpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial training or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the search space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high probability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared to an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%). Furthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000 evaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with simulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%.

Abstract: We present a non-linear AI-model designed to reconstruct monthly mean anomalies of the European temperature and precipitation based on the Euro-Atlantic Weather regimes (WR) indices. WR represent recurrent, quasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that exert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an opportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has focused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather, the estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is currently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and introduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices, describing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the corresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We discuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter temperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and summer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric circulation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the reconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields improved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal forecast system, SEAS5. As a demonstration of practical applicability, we evaluate the model using WR indices predicted by SEAS5, finding slightly better or comparable skill relative to the SEAS5 forecast itself. Our findings demonstrate that WR-based anomaly reconstruction, powered by AI tools, offers a promising pathway for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic survey of Discrete Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) and Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Language Models (dMLLMs). Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed.
  The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models, and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

Abstract: Comparison-based preference learning has become central to the alignment of AI models with human preferences. However, these methods may behave counterintuitively. After empirically observing that, when accounting for a preference for response $y$ over $z$, the model may actually decrease the probability (and reward) of generating $y$ (an observation also made by others), this paper investigates the root causes of (non) monotonicity, for a general comparison-based preference learning framework that subsumes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) and Generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT). Under mild assumptions, we prove that such methods still satisfy what we call local pairwise monotonicity. We also provide a bouquet of formalizations of monotonicity, and identify sufficient conditions for their guarantee, thereby providing a toolbox to evaluate how prone learning models are to monotonicity violations. These results clarify the limitations of current methods and provide guidance for developing more trustworthy preference learning algorithms.

Abstract: We prove that any Turing machine running on inputs of arbitrary length can be simulated by a constant bit-size transformer, as long as the context window is sufficiently long. This improves previous works, which require scaling up either the model's precision or the number of parameters on longer inputs. Furthermore, we prove that the complexity class SPACE$[s(n)]$ exactly characterizes the expressive power of a constant bit-size transformer with a context window of length $s(n)$. Our approach relies on simulating Post machines, a Turing-complete computational model. Post machines can be modeled as automata equipped with a queue, exhibiting computational behaviors naturally aligned with those of transformers. The behavioral similarity between transformers and Post machines may offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the reasoning abilities of transformers.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving city safety and informing policy decisions. In this study, we analyze traffic incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in improving classification reliability.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE. Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in large-scale models.

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable. Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid variational framework that enhances Neural Quantum States (NQS) with a Normalising Flow-based sampler to improve the expressivity and trainability of quantum many-body wavefunctions. Our approach decouples the sampling task from the variational ansatz by learning a continuous flow model that targets a discretised, amplitude-supported subspace of the Hilbert space. This overcomes limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and autoregressive methods, especially in regimes with long-range correlations and volume-law entanglement. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model with both short- and long-range interactions, our method achieves comparable ground state energy errors with state-of-the-art matrix product states and lower energies than autoregressive NQS. For systems up to 50 spins, we demonstrate high accuracy and robust convergence across a wide range of coupling strengths, including regimes where competing methods fail. Our results showcase the utility of flow-assisted sampling as a scalable tool for quantum simulation and offer a new approach toward learning expressive quantum states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: Evaluating anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) requires careful consideration of temporal dependencies, particularly when detecting subsequence anomalies common in fault detection scenarios. While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000 MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only 10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in MRI such as classification of image properties including body location, sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many applications.

Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) inference on power-constrained edge devices is bottlenecked by costly weight storage and data movement. We introduce MIWEN, a radio-frequency (RF) analog architecture that ``disaggregates'' memory by streaming weights wirelessly and performing classification in the analog front end of standard transceivers. By encoding weights and activations onto RF carriers and using native mixers as computation units, MIWEN eliminates local weight memory and the overhead of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion. We derive the effective number of bits of radio-frequency analog computation under thermal noise, quantify the energy--precision trade-off, and demonstrate digital-comparable MNIST accuracy at orders-of-magnitude lower energy, unlocking real-time inference on low-power, memory-free edge devices.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are central to science and engineering applications including causal inference, scheduling, and neural architecture search. In this work, we introduce the DAG Convolutional Network (DCN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed specifically for convolutional learning from signals supported on DAGs. The DCN leverages causal graph filters to learn nodal representations that account for the partial ordering inherent to DAGs, a strong inductive bias does not present in conventional GNNs. Unlike prior art in machine learning over DAGs, DCN builds on formal convolutional operations that admit spectral-domain representations. We further propose the Parallel DCN (PDCN), a model that feeds input DAG signals to a parallel bank of causal graph-shift operators and processes these DAG-aware features using a shared multilayer perceptron. This way, PDCN decouples model complexity from graph size while maintaining satisfactory predictive performance. The architectures' permutation equivariance and expressive power properties are also established. Comprehensive numerical tests across several tasks, datasets, and experimental conditions demonstrate that (P)DCN compares favorably with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results position (P)DCN as a viable framework for deep learning from DAG-structured data that is designed from first (graph) signal processing principles.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the SSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the model's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a 3.9\% improvement on the AudioSet-2M (AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1\% (mAP).

Abstract: This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each method from first principles with complete mathematical development, emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the era of large astronomical surveys.

Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3\% in precision and up to 22.3\% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot. We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use, and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less user burden relative to non-active baselines.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge. Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3% on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

We make a case for developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to automate cloud infrastructure management tasks. In a preliminary study, we investigate the potential for AI agents to use different cloud/user interfaces such as software development kits (SDK), command line interfaces (CLI), Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platforms, and web portals. We report takeaways on their effectiveness on different management tasks, and identify research challenges and potential solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.

<title>Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory</title>

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.

Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) at the wrists could enable natural, keyboard-free text entry, yet the state-of-the-art emg2qwerty baseline still misrecognizes $51.8\%$ of characters in the zero-shot setting on unseen users and $7.0\%$ after user-specific fine-tuning. We trace many of these errors to mismatched cross-user signal statistics, fragile reliance on high-order feature dependencies, and the absence of architectural inductive biases aligned with the bilateral nature of typing. To address these issues, we introduce three simple modifications: (i) Rolling Time Normalization, which adaptively aligns input distributions across users; (ii) Aggressive Channel Masking, which encourages reliance on low-order feature combinations more likely to generalize across users; and (iii) a Split-and-Share encoder that processes each hand independently with weight-shared streams to reflect the bilateral symmetry of the neuromuscular system. Combined with a five-fold reduction in spectral resolution ($33\!\rightarrow\!6$ frequency bands), these components yield a compact Split-and-Share model, SplashNet-mini, which uses only $\tfrac14$ the parameters and $0.6\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline while reducing character-error rate (CER) to $36.4\%$ zero-shot and $5.9\%$ after fine-tuning. An upscaled variant, SplashNet ($\tfrac12$ the parameters, $1.15\times$ the FLOPs of the baseline), further lowers error to $35.7\%$ and $5.5\%$, representing relative improvements of $31\%$ and $21\%$ in the zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, respectively. SplashNet therefore establishes a new state of the art without requiring additional data.

Abstract: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing, training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%.

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs, inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria; and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Abstract: Explainable ML algorithms are designed to provide transparency and insight into their decision-making process. Explaining how ML models come to their prediction is critical in fields such as healthcare and finance, as it provides insight into how models can help detect bias in predictions and help comply with GDPR compliance in these fields. QML leverages quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition, offering the potential for computational speedup and greater insights compared to classical ML. However, QML models also inherit the black-box nature of their classical counterparts, requiring the development of explainability techniques to be applied to these QML models to help understand why and how a particular output was generated.
  This paper will explore the idea of creating a modular, explainable QML framework that splits QML algorithms into their core components, such as feature maps, variational circuits (ansatz), optimizers, kernels, and quantum-classical loops. Each component will be analyzed using explainability techniques, such as ALE and SHAP, which have been adapted to analyse the different components of these QML algorithms. By combining insights from these parts, the paper aims to infer explainability to the overall QML model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically, Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning (R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any architectural changes.

Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have experienced rapid advancements in recent years due to their ability to learn meaningful representations from graph data structures. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a viable machine learning approach for training a shared model on decentralized data, addressing privacy concerns while leveraging parallelism. Existing methods that address the unique requirements of federated GNN training using remote embeddings to enhance convergence accuracy are limited by their diminished performance due to large communication costs with a shared embedding server. In this paper, we present OpES, an optimized federated GNN training framework that uses remote neighbourhood pruning, and overlaps pushing of embeddings to the server with local training to reduce the network costs and training time. The modest drop in per-round accuracy due to pre-emptive push of embeddings is out-stripped by the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like Reddit and Products, converging up to $\approx2\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art technique using an embedding server and giving up to $20\%$ better accuracy than vanilla federated GNN learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Adjusted Shuffling SARAH, a novel algorithm that integrates shuffling techniques with the well-known variance-reduced algorithm SARAH while dynamically adjusting the stochastic gradient weights in each update to enhance exploration. Our method achieves the best-known gradient complexity for shuffling variance reduction methods in a strongly convex setting. This result applies to any shuffling technique, which narrows the gap in the complexity analysis of variance reduction methods between uniform sampling and shuffling data. Furthermore, we introduce Inexact Adjusted Reshuffling SARAH, an inexact variant of Adjusted Shuffling SARAH that eliminates the need for full-batch gradient computations. This algorithm retains the same linear convergence rate as Adjusted Shuffling SARAH while showing an advantage in total complexity when the sample size is very large.

Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Link prediction in multilayer networks is a key challenge in applications such as recommendation systems and protein-protein interaction prediction. While many techniques have been developed, most rely on assumptions about shared structures and require access to raw auxiliary data, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for multilayer networks using a bi-level model averaging method. A $K$-fold cross-validation criterion based on edges is used to automatically weight inter-layer and intra-layer candidate models. This enables the transfer of information from auxiliary layers while mitigating model uncertainty, even without prior knowledge of shared structures. Theoretically, we prove the optimality and weight convergence of our method under mild conditions. Computationally, our framework is efficient and privacy-preserving, as it avoids raw data sharing and supports parallel processing across multiple servers. Simulations show our method outperforms others in predictive accuracy and robustness. We further demonstrate its practical value through two real-world recommendation system applications.

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) transmit delicate quantum information across noisy quantum channels. Crucial applications, like quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation (DQC), rely on efficient quantum information transmission. Learning the best path between a pair of end nodes in a QN is key to enhancing such applications. This paper addresses learning the best path in a QN in the online learning setting. We explore two types of feedback: "link-level" and "path-level". Link-level feedback pertains to QNs with advanced quantum switches that enable link-level benchmarking. Path-level feedback, on the other hand, is associated with basic quantum switches that permit only path-level benchmarking. We introduce two online learning algorithms, BeQuP-Link and BeQuP-Path, to identify the best path using link-level and path-level feedback, respectively. To learn the best path, BeQuP-Link benchmarks the critical links dynamically, while BeQuP-Path relies on a subroutine, transferring path-level observations to estimate link-level parameters in a batch manner. We analyze the quantum resource complexity of these algorithms and demonstrate that both can efficiently and, with high probability, determine the best path. Finally, we perform NetSquid-based simulations and validate that both algorithms accurately and efficiently identify the best path.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves adaptation performance across different video classification models and represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into video TTA.

Abstract: This thesis deals with neural networks that respect symmetries and presents the advantages in applying them to lattice field theory problems. The concept of equivariance is explained, together with the reason why such a property is crucial for the network to preserve the desired symmetry. The benefits of choosing equivariant networks are first illustrated for translational symmetry on a complex scalar field toy model. The discussion is then extended to gauge theories, for which Lattice Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (L-CNNs) are specifically designed ad hoc. Regressions of physical observables such as Wilson loops are successfully solved by L-CNNs, whereas traditional architectures which are not gauge symmetric perform significantly worse. Finally, we introduce the technique of neural gradient flow, which is an ordinary differential equation solved by neural networks, and propose it as a method to generate lattice gauge configurations.

Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials design, yet predicting complex properties like alloy ductility remains challenging due to the influence of processing conditions and microstructural features that resist quantification through traditional reductionist approaches. Here, we present an innovative information fusion architecture that integrates domain-specific texts from materials science literature with quantitative physical descriptors to overcome these limitations. Our framework employs MatSciBERT for advanced textual comprehension and incorporates contrastive learning to automatically extract implicit knowledge regarding processing parameters and microstructural characteristics. Through rigorous ablation studies and comparative experiments, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.849 and 0.680 on titanium alloy validation set and refractory multi-principal-element alloy test set. This systematic approach provides a holistic framework for property prediction in complex material systems where quantitative descriptors are incomplete and establishes a foundation for knowledge-guided materials design and informatics-driven materials discovery.

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/llm-media-profiling.

<title>Language Models Enable Data-Augmented Synthesis Planning for Inorganic Materials</title>

Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1 precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 % on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 {\deg}C, matching specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to 70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset, SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73 {\deg}C and in calcination temperature to 98 {\deg}C. This strategy improves models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.

<title>Performance Plateaus in Inference-Time Scaling for Text-to-Image Diffusion Without External Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Abstract: Our research addresses the critical challenge of managing blood transfusions and optimizing allocation in resource-constrained regions. We present heuristic matching algorithms for donor-patient and blood bank selection, alongside machine learning methods to analyze blood transfusion acceptance data and predict potential shortages. We developed simulations to optimize blood bank operations, progressing from random allocation to a system incorporating proximity-based selection, blood type compatibility, expiration prioritization, and rarity scores. Moving from blind matching to a heuristic-based approach yielded a 28.6% marginal improvement in blood request acceptance, while a multi-level heuristic matching resulted in a 47.6% improvement. For shortage prediction, we compared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear Regression, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, trained on 170 days of historical data. Linear Regression slightly outperformed others with a 1.40% average absolute percentage difference in predictions. Our solution leverages a Cassandra NoSQL database, integrating heuristic optimization and shortage prediction to proactively manage blood resources. This scalable approach, designed for resource-constrained environments, considers factors such as proximity, blood type compatibility, inventory expiration, and rarity. Future developments will incorporate real-world data and additional variables to improve prediction accuracy and optimization performance.

<title>Glocal Smoothness: Line Search can really help!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iteration complexities for first-order optimization algorithms are typically stated in terms of a global Lipschitz constant of the gradient, and near-optimal results are achieved using fixed step sizes. But many objective functions that arise in practice have regions with small Lipschitz constants where larger step sizes can be used. Many local Lipschitz assumptions have been proposed, which have lead to results showing that adaptive step sizes and/or line searches yield improved convergence rates over fixed step sizes. However, these faster rates tend to depend on the iterates of the algorithm, which makes it difficult to compare the iteration complexities of different methods. We consider a simple characterization of global and local ("glocal") smoothness that only depends on properties of the function. This allows upper bounds on iteration complexities in terms of iterate-independent constants and enables us to compare iteration complexities between algorithms. Under this assumption it is straightforward to show the advantages of line searches over fixed step sizes, and that in some settings, gradient descent with line search has a better iteration complexity than accelerated methods with fixed step sizes. We further show that glocal smoothness can lead to improved complexities for the Polyak and AdGD step sizes, as well other algorithms including coordinate optimization, stochastic gradient methods, accelerated gradient methods, and non-linear conjugate gradient methods.

<title>Beyond Sin-Squared Error: Linear-Time Entrywise Uncertainty Quantification for Streaming PCA</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical inference framework for streaming principal component analysis (PCA) using Oja's algorithm, enabling the construction of confidence intervals for individual entries of the estimated eigenvector. Most existing works on streaming PCA focus on providing sharp sin-squared error guarantees. Recently, there has been some interest in uncertainty quantification for the sin-squared error. However, uncertainty quantification or sharp error guarantees for entries of the estimated eigenvector in the streaming setting remains largely unexplored. We derive a sharp Bernstein-type concentration bound for elements of the estimated vector matching the optimal error rate up to logarithmic factors. We also establish a Central Limit Theorem for a suitably centered and scaled subset of the entries. To efficiently estimate the coordinate-wise variance, we introduce a provably consistent subsampling algorithm that leverages the median-of-means approach, empirically achieving similar accuracy to multiplier bootstrap methods while being significantly more computationally efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in providing reliable uncertainty estimates with a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods.

<title>INTERPOS: Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing for Mobile App Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: The mobile app market has expanded exponentially, offering millions of apps with diverse functionalities, yet research in mobile app recommendation remains limited. Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items in users' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users. Position embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for natural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in sequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can capture the order of items in a user's historical interaction sequence. Nevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two interactions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as "user rhythm". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This approach enables a deep understanding of users' rhythms at a fine-grained level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures. Our extensive evaluations show that INTERPOS outperforms state-of-the-art models using 7 mobile app recommendation datasets on NDCG@K and HIT@K metrics. The source code of INTERPOS is available at https://github.com/dlgrad/INTERPOS.

Abstract: Numerous tools for neural network inference are currently available, yet many do not meet the requirements of real-time audio applications. In response, we introduce anira, an efficient cross-platform library. To ensure compatibility with a broad range of neural network architectures and frameworks, anira supports ONNX Runtime, LibTorch, and TensorFlow Lite as backends. Each inference engine exhibits real-time violations, which anira mitigates by decoupling the inference from the audio callback to a static thread pool. The library incorporates built-in latency management and extensive benchmarking capabilities, both crucial to ensure a continuous signal flow. Three different neural network architectures for audio effect emulation are then subjected to benchmarking across various configurations. Statistical modeling is employed to identify the influence of various factors on performance. The findings indicate that for stateless models, ONNX Runtime exhibits the lowest runtimes. For stateful models, LibTorch demonstrates the fastest performance. Our results also indicate that for certain model-engine combinations, the initial inferences take longer, particularly when these inferences exhibit a higher incidence of real-time violations.

Abstract: Policymakers in resource-constrained settings require experimental designs that satisfy strict budget limits while ensuring precise estimation of treatment effects. We propose a framework that applies a dependent randomized rounding procedure to convert assignment probabilities into binary treatment decisions. Our proposed solution preserves the marginal treatment probabilities while inducing negative correlations among assignments, leading to improved estimator precision through variance reduction. We establish theoretical guarantees for the inverse propensity weighted and general linear estimators, and demonstrate through empirical studies that our approach yields efficient and accurate inference under fixed budget constraints.

<title>Adapting by Analogy: OOD Generalization of Visuomotor Policies via Functional Correspondence</title>

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors. However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds, or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil. The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator. Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and environment conditions with low feedback.

<title>MGDFIS: Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy for Small Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks, achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online. We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently, we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly. Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10% performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a 7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

Abstract: Generalized linear bandits have been extensively studied due to their broad applicability in real-world online decision-making problems. However, these methods typically assume that the expected reward function is known to the users, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. Misspecification of this link function can lead to the failure of all existing algorithms. In this work, we address this critical limitation by introducing a new problem of generalized linear bandits with unknown reward functions, also known as single index bandits. We first consider the case where the unknown reward function is monotonically increasing, and propose two novel and efficient algorithms, STOR and ESTOR, that achieve decent regrets under standard assumptions. Notably, our ESTOR can obtain the nearly optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the time horizon $T$. We then extend our methods to the high-dimensional sparse setting and show that the same regret rate can be attained with the sparsity index. Next, we introduce GSTOR, an algorithm that is agnostic to general reward functions, and establish regret bounds under a Gaussian design assumption. Finally, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<title>Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework for Recommendation Models</title>

Abstract: In modern recommender systems, CTR/CVR models are increasingly trained with ranking objectives to improve item ranking quality. While this shift aligns training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems.

Abstract: In autonomous underwater missions, the successful completion of predefined paths mainly depends on the ability of underwater vehicles to recognise their surroundings. In this study, we apply the concept of Fast Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (FIT2-FELM) to train a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang IT2 Fuzzy Inference System (TSK IT2-FIS) for on-board sonar data classification using an underwater vehicle called BlueROV2. The TSK IT2-FIS is integrated into a Hierarchical Navigation Strategy (HNS) as the main navigation engine to infer local motions and provide the BlueROV2 with full autonomy to follow an obstacle-free trajectory in a water container of 2.5m x 2.5m x 3.5m. Compared to traditional navigation architectures, using the proposed method, we observe a robust path following behaviour in the presence of uncertainty and noise. We found that the proposed approach provides the BlueROV with a more complete sensory picture about its surroundings while real-time navigation planning is performed by the concurrent execution of two or more tasks.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a critical challenge in robotics: translating text-driven human motions into executable actions for humanoid robots, enabling efficient and cost-effective learning of new behaviors. While existing text-to-motion generation methods achieve semantic alignment between language and motion, they often produce kinematically or physically infeasible motions unsuitable for real-world deployment. To bridge this sim-to-real gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that integrates physics-aware motion evaluation with text-conditioned motion generation. RLPF employs a motion tracking policy to assess feasibility in a physics simulator, generating rewards for fine-tuning the motion generator. Furthermore, RLPF introduces an alignment verification module to preserve semantic fidelity to text instructions. This joint optimization ensures both physical plausibility and instruction alignment. Extensive experiments show that RLPF greatly outperforms baseline methods in generating physically feasible motions while maintaining semantic correspondence with text instruction, enabling successful deployment on real humanoid robots.

Abstract: Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation.

Abstract: Generalization under distribution shift remains a core challenge in modern machine learning, yet existing learning bound theory is limited to narrow, idealized settings and is non-estimable from samples. In this paper, we bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. We first show that existing bounds become loose and non-estimable because their concept shift definition breaks when the source and target supports mismatch. Leveraging entropic optimal transport, we propose new support-agnostic definitions for covariate and concept shifts, and derive a novel unified error bound that applies to broad loss functions, label spaces, and stochastic labeling. We further develop estimators for these shifts with concentration guarantees, and the DataShifts algorithm, which can quantify distribution shifts and estimate the error bound in most applications -- a rigorous and general tool for analyzing learning error under distribution shift.

Abstract: Fair clustering has become a socially significant task with the advancement of machine learning technologies and the growing demand for trustworthy AI. Group fairness ensures that the proportions of each sensitive group are similar in all clusters. Most existing group-fair clustering methods are based on the $K$-means clustering and thus require the distance between instances and the number of clusters to be given in advance. To resolve this limitation, we propose a fair Bayesian model-based clustering called Fair Bayesian Clustering (FBC). We develop a specially designed prior which puts its mass only on fair clusters, and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm. Advantages of FBC are that it can infer the number of clusters and can be applied to any data type as long as the likelihood is defined (e.g., categorical data). Experiments on real-world datasets show that FBC (i) reasonably infers the number of clusters, (ii) achieves a competitive utility-fairness trade-off compared to existing fair clustering methods, and (iii) performs well on categorical data.

Abstract: The emergence of online social platforms, such as social networks and social media, has drastically affected the way people apprehend the information flows to which they are exposed. In such platforms, various information cascades spreading among users is the main force creating complex dynamics of opinion formation, each user being characterized by their own behavior adoption mechanism. Moreover, the spread of multiple pieces of information or beliefs in a networked population is rarely uncorrelated. In this paper, we introduce the Mixture of Interacting Cascades (MIC), a model of marked multidimensional Hawkes processes with the capacity to model jointly non-trivial interaction between cascades and users. We emphasize on the interplay between information cascades and user activity, and use a mixture of temporal point processes to build a coupled user/cascade point process model. Experiments on synthetic and real data highlight the benefits of this approach and demonstrate that MIC achieves superior performance to existing methods in modeling the spread of information cascades. Finally, we demonstrate how MIC can provide, through its learned parameters, insightful bi-layered visualizations of real social network activity data.

Abstract: Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred. Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models. However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack -- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of AI-generated text.

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2) The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results suggest that different network architectures have different frequency preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a valuable reference to the AI model security community.

<title>Evolutionary Developmental Biology Can Serve as the Conceptual Foundation for a New Design Paradigm in Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by advancements in machine learning, has made significant strides in solving complex tasks. However, the current neural network-based paradigm, while effective, is heavily constrained by inherent limitations, primarily a lack of structural organization and a progression of learning that displays undesirable properties. As AI research progresses without a unifying framework, it either tries to patch weaknesses heuristically or draws loosely from biological mechanisms without strong theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, the recent paradigm shift in evolutionary understanding -- driven primarily by evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) -- has been largely overlooked in AI literature, despite a striking analogy between the Modern Synthesis and contemporary machine learning, evident in their shared assumptions, approaches, and limitations upon careful analysis. Consequently, the principles of adaptation from EDB that reshaped our understanding of the evolutionary process can also form the foundation of a unifying conceptual framework for the next design philosophy in AI, going beyond mere inspiration and grounded firmly in biology's first principles. This article provides a detailed overview of the analogy between the Modern Synthesis and modern machine learning, and outlines the core principles of a new AI design paradigm based on insights from EDB. To exemplify our analysis, we also present two learning system designs grounded in specific developmental principles -- regulatory connections, somatic variation and selection, and weak linkage -- that resolve multiple major limitations of contemporary machine learning in an organic manner, while also providing deeper insights into the role of these mechanisms in biological evolution.

Abstract: Variational Learning (VL) has recently gained popularity for training deep neural networks and is competitive to standard learning methods. Part of its empirical success can be explained by theories such as PAC-Bayes bounds, minimum description length and marginal likelihood, but there are few tools to unravel the implicit regularization in play. Here, we analyze the implicit regularization of VL through the Edge of Stability (EoS) framework. EoS has previously been used to show that gradient descent can find flat solutions and we extend this result to VL to show that it can find even flatter solutions. This is obtained by controlling the posterior covariance and the number of Monte Carlo samples from the posterior. These results are derived in a similar fashion as the standard EoS literature for deep learning, by first deriving a result for a quadratic problem and then extending it to deep neural networks. We empirically validate these findings on a wide variety of large networks, such as ResNet and ViT, to find that the theoretical results closely match the empirical ones. Ours is the first work to analyze the EoS dynamics in VL.

<title>Constraint-Guided Prediction Refinement via Deterministic Diffusion Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning tasks require outputs that satisfy hard constraints, such as physical conservation laws, structured dependencies in graphs, or column-level relationships in tabular data. Existing approaches rely either on domain-specific architectures and losses or on strong assumptions on the constraint space, restricting their applicability to linear or convex constraints. We propose a general-purpose framework for constraint-aware refinement that leverages denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs). Starting from a coarse prediction, our method iteratively refines it through a deterministic diffusion trajectory guided by a learned prior and augmented by constraint gradient corrections. The approach accommodates a wide class of non-convex and nonlinear equality constraints and can be applied post hoc to any base model. We demonstrate the method in two representative domains: constrained adversarial attack generation on tabular data with column-level dependencies and in AC power flow prediction under Kirchhoff's laws. Across both settings, our diffusion-guided refinement improves both constraint satisfaction and performance while remaining lightweight and model-agnostic.

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration, memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of emergent agent behavior.

<title>Reasoning Model Unlearning: Forgetting Traces, Not Just Answers, While Preserving Reasoning Skills</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled strong chain-of-thought (CoT) generation through test-time computation. While these multi-step reasoning capabilities represent a major milestone in language model performance, they also introduce new safety risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study to revisit the problem of machine unlearning in the context of LRMs. Machine unlearning refers to the process of removing the influence of sensitive, harmful, or undesired data or knowledge from a trained model without full retraining. We show that conventional unlearning algorithms, originally designed for non-reasoning models, are inadequate for LRMs. In particular, even when final answers are successfully erased, sensitive information often persists within the intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., CoT trajectories. To address this challenge, we extend conventional unlearning and propose Reasoning-aware Representation Misdirection for Unlearning ($R^2MU$), a novel method that effectively suppresses sensitive reasoning traces and prevents the generation of associated final answers, while preserving the model's reasoning ability. Our experiments demonstrate that $R^2MU$ significantly reduces sensitive information leakage within reasoning traces and achieves strong performance across both safety and reasoning benchmarks, evaluated on state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

Abstract: Data discovery and table unionability in particular became key tasks in modern Data Science. However, the human perspective for these tasks is still under-explored. Thus, this research investigates the human behavior in determining table unionability within data discovery. We have designed an experimental survey and conducted a comprehensive analysis, in which we assess human decision-making for table unionability. We use the observations from the analysis to develop a machine learning framework to boost the (raw) performance of humans. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary study on how LLM performance is compared to humans indicating that it is typically better to consider a combination of both. We believe that this work lays the foundations for developing future Human-in-the-Loop systems for efficient data discovery.

Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.

Abstract: Existing work in automatic music generation has primarily focused on end-to-end systems that produce complete compositions or continuations. However, because musical composition is typically an iterative process, such systems make it difficult to engage in the back-and-forth between human and machine that is essential to computer-assisted creativity. In this study, we address the task of personalizable, multi-track, long-context, and controllable symbolic music infilling to enhance the process of computer-assisted composition. We present MIDI-RWKV, a novel model based on the RWKV-7 linear architecture, to enable efficient and coherent musical cocreation on edge devices. We also demonstrate that MIDI-RWKV admits an effective method of finetuning its initial state for personalization in the very-low-sample regime. We evaluate MIDI-RWKV and its state tuning on several quantitative and qualitative metrics, and release model weights and code at https://github.com/christianazinn/MIDI-RWKV.

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on efficiently removing specific data from trained models, addressing privacy and compliance concerns with reasonable costs. Although exact unlearning ensures complete data removal equivalent to retraining, it is impractical for large-scale models, leading to growing interest in inexact unlearning methods. However, the lack of formal guarantees in these methods necessitates the need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess their privacy and effectiveness. In this work, we first identify several key pitfalls of the existing unlearning evaluation frameworks, e.g., focusing on average-case evaluation or targeting random samples for evaluation, incomplete comparisons with the retraining baseline. Then, we propose RULI (Rectified Unlearning Evaluation Framework via Likelihood Inference), a novel framework to address critical gaps in the evaluation of inexact unlearning methods. RULI introduces a dual-objective attack to measure both unlearning efficacy and privacy risks at a per-sample granularity. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art unlearning methods, where RULI achieves higher attack success rates, exposing privacy risks underestimated by existing methods. Built on a game-based foundation and validated through empirical evaluations on both image and text data (spanning tasks from classification to generation), RULI provides a rigorous, scalable, and fine-grained methodology for evaluating unlearning techniques.

Abstract: Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that low-resource languages face.

We identify critical gaps in current research, including the paradox of detection without distinction, the lack of clear criteria for practitioners to evaluate certification schemes, and the potential security risks arising from users' expectations surrounding ``guaranteed" robustness claims. This position paper is a call to arms for the certification research community, proposing concrete steps to address these fundamental challenges and advance the field toward practical applicability.

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations. Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and (iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/StressTestingMMFMinCR.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to navigate the highly non-convex landscape of the object function to achieve three types of transmission matrices: (1) Fixed-ratio power conversion and zero-transmission mode in rank-1 matrices, (2) exceptional points with degenerate eigenvalues and unidirectional mode conversion, and (3) uniform channel participation is enforced when transmission eigenvalues are degenerate.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

Abstract: While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach for the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). Our system aims to improve the accuracy of translating named entities by combining two key approaches: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative self-refinement techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs). A distinctive feature of our system is its self-evaluation mechanism, where the LLM assesses its own translations based on two key criteria: the accuracy of entity translations and overall translation quality. We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

Abstract: Solving Inverse Kinematics (IK) problems is fundamental to robotics, but has primarily been successful with single serial manipulators. For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS) is essential for personalized online learning, yet current approaches struggle to balance complex educational constraints and maintain optimization stability. This paper proposes a Memetic Walrus Optimizer (MWO) that enhances optimization performance through three key innovations: (1) an expert-guided strategy with aging mechanism that improves escape from local optima; (2) an adaptive control signal framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation; and (3) a three-tier priority mechanism for generating educationally meaningful sequences. We formulate ACS as a multi-objective optimization problem considering concept coverage, time constraints, and learning style compatibility. Experiments on the OULAD dataset demonstrate MWO's superior performance, achieving 95.3% difficulty progression rate (compared to 87.2% in baseline methods) and significantly better convergence stability (standard deviation of 18.02 versus 28.29-696.97 in competing algorithms). Additional validation on benchmark functions confirms MWO's robust optimization capability across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate MWO's effectiveness in generating personalized learning sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: In this white paper, we present AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent that substantially enhances capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on highly challenging tasks such as tackling open scientific problems or optimizing critical pieces of computational infrastructure. AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often operate on high-dimensional data and rely on overparameterized models, where classical low-dimensional intuitions break down. In particular, the proportional regime where the data dimension, sample size, and number of model parameters are all large and comparable, gives rise to novel and sometimes counterintuitive behaviors. This paper extends traditional Random Matrix Theory (RMT) beyond eigenvalue-based analysis of linear models to address the challenges posed by nonlinear ML models such as DNNs in this regime. We introduce the concept of High-dimensional Equivalent, which unifies and generalizes both Deterministic Equivalent and Linear Equivalent, to systematically address three technical challenges: high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and the need to analyze generic eigenspectral functionals. Leveraging this framework, we provide precise characterizations of the training and generalization performance of linear models, nonlinear shallow networks, and deep networks. Our results capture rich phenomena, including scaling laws, double descent, and nonlinear learning dynamics, offering a unified perspective on the theoretical understanding of deep learning in high dimensions.

Abstract: An internet network service provider manages its network with multiple objectives, such as high quality of service (QoS) and minimum computing resource usage. To achieve these objectives, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) algorithm has been proposed to train its network management agent. Usually, their algorithms optimize their agents with respect to a single static reward formulation consisting of multiple objectives with fixed importance factors, which we call preferences. However, in practice, the preference could vary according to network status, external concerns and so on. For example, when a server shuts down and it can cause other servers' traffic overloads leading to additional shutdowns, it is plausible to reduce the preference of QoS while increasing the preference of minimum computing resource usages. In this paper, we propose new RL-based network management agents that can select actions based on both states and preferences. With our proposed approach, we expect a single agent to generalize on various states and preferences. Furthermore, we propose a numerical method that can estimate the distribution of preference that is advantageous for unbiased training. Our experiment results show that the RL agents trained based on our proposed approach significantly generalize better with various preferences than the previous RL approaches, which assume static preference during training. Moreover, we demonstrate several analyses that show the advantages of our numerical estimation method.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

<title>Efficient Approximate Temporal Triangle Counting in Streaming with Predictions</title>

Abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental and widely studied problem on static graphs, and recently on temporal graphs, where edges carry information on the timings of the associated events. Streaming processing and resource efficiency are crucial requirements for counting triangles in modern massive temporal graphs, with millions of nodes and up to billions of temporal edges. However, current exact and approximate algorithms are unable to handle large-scale temporal graphs. To fill such a gap, we introduce STEP, a scalable and efficient algorithm to approximate temporal triangle counts from a stream of temporal edges. STEP combines predictions to the number of triangles a temporal edge is involved in, with a simple sampling strategy, leading to scalability, efficiency, and accurate approximation of all eight temporal triangle types simultaneously. We analytically prove that, by using a sublinear amount of memory, STEP obtains unbiased and very accurate estimates. In fact, even noisy predictions can significantly reduce the variance of STEP's estimates. Our extensive experiments on massive temporal graphs with up to billions of edges demonstrate that STEP outputs high-quality estimates and is more efficient than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing conceptual knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/align-then-unlearn.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is extensively employed in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to its non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution. However, EEG analysis faces significant challenges, including noise, nonstationarity, and inter-subject variability, which hinder its clinical utility. Traditional neural networks often lack integration with biophysical knowledge, limiting their interpretability, robustness, and potential for medical translation. To address these limitations, this study introduces NeuroPhysNet, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework tailored for EEG signal analysis and motor imagery classification in medical contexts. NeuroPhysNet incorporates the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, embedding neurodynamical principles to constrain predictions and enhance model robustness. Evaluated on the BCIC-IV-2a dataset, the framework achieved superior accuracy and generalization compared to conventional methods, especially in data-limited and cross-subject scenarios, which are common in clinical settings. By effectively integrating biophysical insights with data-driven techniques, NeuroPhysNet not only advances BCI applications but also holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and reliability of clinical diagnostics, such as motor disorder assessments and neurorehabilitation planning.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks. Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some (possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies. Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the boundary on average.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization, which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose $TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis. This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source localization. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WenlongWan/Audible623.

Abstract: Disassembly is a crucial yet challenging step in binary analysis. While emerging neural disassemblers show promise for efficiency and accuracy, they frequently generate outputs violating fundamental structural constraints, which significantly compromise their practical usability. To address this critical problem, we regularize the disassembly solution space by formalizing and applying key structural constraints based on post-dominance relations. This approach systematically detects widespread errors in existing neural disassemblers' outputs. These errors often originate from models' limited context modeling and instruction-level decoding that neglect global structural integrity. We introduce Tady, a novel neural disassembler featuring an improved model architecture and a dedicated post-processing algorithm, specifically engineered to address these deficiencies. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse binaries demonstrate that Tady effectively eliminates structural constraint violations and functions with high efficiency, while maintaining instruction-level accuracy.

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations, and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at https://github.com/just1nseo/verifying-the-verifiers

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

<title>Socratic RL: A Novel Framework for Efficient Knowledge Acquisition through Iterative Reflection and Viewpoint Distillation</title>

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: We study finite-armed semiparametric bandits, where each arm's reward combines a linear component with an unknown, potentially adversarial shift. This model strictly generalizes classical linear bandits and reflects complexities common in practice. We propose the first experimental-design approach that simultaneously offers a sharp regret bound, a PAC bound, and a best-arm identification guarantee. Our method attains the minimax regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$, matching the known lower bound for finite-armed linear bandits, and further achieves logarithmic regret under a positive suboptimality gap condition. These guarantees follow from our refined non-asymptotic analysis of orthogonalized regression that attains the optimal $\sqrt{d}$ rate, paving the way for robust and efficient learning across a broad class of semiparametric bandit problems.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for high-performance Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing systems such as 5G New Radio, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio and stringent latency constraints. This letter presents HELENA, a compact deep learning model that combines a lightweight convolutional backbone with two efficient attention mechanisms: patch-wise multi-head self-attention for capturing global dependencies and a squeeze-and-excitation block for local feature refinement. Compared to CEViT, a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based estimator, HELENA reduces inference time by 45.0\% (0.175\,ms vs.\ 0.318\,ms), achieves comparable accuracy ($-16.78$\,dB vs.\ $-17.30$\,dB), and requires $8\times$ fewer parameters (0.11M vs.\ 0.88M), demonstrating its suitability for low-latency, real-time deployment.

<title>Balancing Intensity and Focality in Directional DBS Under Uncertainty: A Simulation Study of Electrode Optimization via a Metaheuristic L1L1 Approach</title>

Abstract: As DBS technology advances toward directional leads and optimization-based current steering, this study aims to improve the selection of electrode contact configurations using the recently developed L1-norm regularized L1-norm fitting (L1L1) method. The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a priori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional approaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework incorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field attenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves to avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode configurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite element (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model accounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the feasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1 method was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both noiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect attenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current distribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization extracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These configurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high gain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods, the L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation within the target region while minimizing unintended current spread, particularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current steering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation parameters.

<title>Language Agents for Hypothesis-driven Clinical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

<title>Curriculum Learning for Biological Sequence Prediction: The Case of De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>

Abstract: Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.

<title>Hierarchical Multi-Positive Contrastive Learning for Patent Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.

Abstract: This paper comprehensively surveys research trends in imitation learning for contact-rich robotic tasks. Contact-rich tasks, which require complex physical interactions with the environment, represent a central challenge in robotics due to their nonlinear dynamics and sensitivity to small positional deviations. The paper examines demonstration collection methodologies, including teaching methods and sensory modalities crucial for capturing subtle interaction dynamics. We then analyze imitation learning approaches, highlighting their applications to contact-rich manipulation. Recent advances in multimodal learning and foundation models have significantly enhanced performance in complex contact tasks across industrial, household, and healthcare domains. Through systematic organization of current research and identification of challenges, this survey provides a foundation for future advancements in contact-rich robotic manipulation.

<title>TensorSLM: Energy-efficient Embedding Compression of Sub-billion Parameter Language Models on Low-end Devices</title>

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy consumption of a single query drops by half.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

Abstract: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared: (1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span, maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across diverse FBG sensor configurations.

Abstract: In this work, we reflect on the data-driven modeling paradigm that is gaining ground in AI-driven automation of patient care. We argue that the repurposing of existing real-world patient datasets for machine learning may not always represent an optimal approach to model development as it could lead to undesirable outcomes in patient care. We reflect on the history of data analysis to explain how the data-driven paradigm rose to popularity, and we envision ways in which systems thinking and clinical domain theory could complement the existing model development approaches in reaching human-centric outcomes. We call for a purpose-driven machine learning paradigm that is grounded in clinical theory and the sociotechnical realities of real-world operational contexts. We argue that understanding the utility of existing patient datasets requires looking in two directions: upstream towards the data generation, and downstream towards the automation objectives. This purpose-driven perspective to AI system development opens up new methodological opportunities and holds promise for AI automation of patient care.

Abstract: We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we focus on the following parametric family: mixtures of isotropic Gaussians (i.e., with diagonal covariance matrices proportional to the identity) and uniform weights. We develop a variational framework and provide efficient algorithms suited for this family. In contrast with mixtures of Gaussian with generic covariance matrices, this choice presents a balance between accurate approximations of multimodal Bayesian posteriors, while being memory and computationally efficient. Our algorithms implement gradient descent on the location of the mixture components (the modes of the Gaussians), and either (an entropic) Mirror or Bures descent on their variance parameters. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms on numerical experiments.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3 within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of recall and precision across habitat formations.

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table, Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1 score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames, forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to support further research in this domain.

Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics, ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.

<title>Turning Down the Heat: A Critical Analysis of Min-p Sampling in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

<title>Enforcing tail calibration when training probabilistic forecast models</title>

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasts are typically obtained using state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models, with model parameters estimated by optimizing a proper scoring rule over a set of training data. If the model class is not correctly specified, then the learned model will not necessarily issue forecasts that are calibrated. Calibrated forecasts allow users to appropriately balance risks in decision making, and it is particularly important that forecast models issue calibrated predictions for extreme events, since such outcomes often generate large socio-economic impacts. In this work, we study how the loss function used to train probabilistic forecast models can be adapted to improve the reliability of forecasts made for extreme events. We investigate loss functions based on weighted scoring rules, and additionally propose regularizing loss functions using a measure of tail miscalibration. We apply these approaches to a hierarchy of increasingly flexible forecast models for UK wind speeds, including simple parametric models, distributional regression networks, and conditional generative models. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art models do not issue calibrated forecasts for extreme wind speeds, and that the calibration of forecasts for extreme events can be improved by suitable adaptations to the loss function during model training. This, however, introduces a trade-off between calibrated forecasts for extreme events and calibrated forecasts for more common outcomes.

<title>Gradient-Normalized Smoothness for Optimization with Approximate Hessians</title>

Abstract: In this work, we develop new optimization algorithms that use approximate second-order information combined with the gradient regularization technique to achieve fast global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives. The key innovation of our analysis is a novel notion called Gradient-Normalized Smoothness, which characterizes the maximum radius of a ball around the current point that yields a good relative approximation of the gradient field. Our theory establishes a natural intrinsic connection between Hessian approximation and the linearization of the gradient. Importantly, Gradient-Normalized Smoothness does not depend on the specific problem class of the objective functions, while effectively translating local information about the gradient field and Hessian approximation into the global behavior of the method. This new concept equips approximate second-order algorithms with universal global convergence guarantees, recovering state-of-the-art rates for functions with H\"older-continuous Hessians and third derivatives, quasi-self-concordant functions, as well as smooth classes in first-order optimization. These rates are achieved automatically and extend to broader classes, such as generalized self-concordant functions. We demonstrate direct applications of our results for global linear rates in logistic regression and softmax problems with approximate Hessians, as well as in non-convex optimization using Fisher and Gauss-Newton approximations.

Abstract: We introduce a frequency-domain framework for convergence analysis of hyperparameters in game optimization, leveraging High-Resolution Differential Equations (HRDEs) and Laplace transforms. Focusing on the Lookahead algorithm--characterized by gradient steps $k$ and averaging coefficient $\alpha$--we transform the discrete-time oscillatory dynamics of bilinear games into the frequency domain to derive precise convergence criteria. Our higher-precision $O(\gamma^2)$-HRDE models yield tighter criteria, while our first-order $O(\gamma)$-HRDE models offer practical guidance by prioritizing actionable hyperparameter tuning over complex closed-form solutions. Empirical validation in discrete-time settings demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which may further extend to locally linear operators, offering a scalable framework for selecting hyperparameters for learning in games.

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant machine learning models exploit symmetries and structural patterns in data to improve sample efficiency. While empirical studies suggest that data-driven methods such as regularization and data augmentation can perform comparably to explicitly invariant models, theoretical insights remain scarce. In this paper, we provide a theoretical comparison of three approaches for achieving invariance: data augmentation, regularization, and hard-wiring. We focus on mean squared error regression with deep linear networks, which parametrize rank-bounded linear maps and can be hard-wired to be invariant to specific group actions. We show that the critical points of the optimization problems for hard-wiring and data augmentation are identical, consisting solely of saddles and the global optimum. By contrast, regularization introduces additional critical points, though they remain saddles except for the global optimum. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regularization path is continuous and converges to the hard-wired solution.

Abstract: The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the problem-solving performance of large language models, particularly on math and coding benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are \emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\% attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32 percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.

<title>Instruction Following by Boosting Attention of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting (InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions. Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both traditional prompting and latent steering.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability</title>

Abstract: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables a set of client devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing raw data. This process, though, operates under the constrained computation and communication resources of edge devices. These constraints combined with systems heterogeneity force some participating clients to perform fewer local updates than expected by the server, thus slowing down convergence. Exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters in FL, furthermore, can be resource-intensive, without which the convergence is adversely affected. In this work, we propose GEL, the guess and learn algorithm. GEL enables constrained edge devices to perform additional learning through guessed updates on top of gradient-based steps. These guesses are gradientless, i.e., participating clients leverage them for free. Our generic guessing algorithm (i) can be flexibly combined with several state-of-the-art algorithms including FEDPROX, FEDNOVA, FEDYOGI or SCALEFL; and (ii) achieves significantly improved performance when the learning rates are not best tuned. We conduct extensive experiments and show that GEL can boost empirical convergence by up to 40% in resource constrained networks while relieving the need for exhaustive learning rate tuning.

Abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure. In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for swap regret, and thus, along the way, imply convergence to a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of weighted regret minimization, with unknown weights determined by the path length of the agents' policy sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.

Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural network architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.

Abstract: Complementary-label learning (CLL) is a weakly-supervised learning paradigm that aims to train a multi-class classifier using only complementary labels, which indicate classes to which an instance does not belong. Despite numerous algorithmic proposals for CLL, their practical applicability remains unverified for two reasons. Firstly, these algorithms often rely on assumptions about the generation of complementary labels, and it is not clear how far the assumptions are from reality. Secondly, their evaluation has been limited to synthetically labeled datasets. To gain insights into the real-world performance of CLL algorithms, we developed a protocol to collect complementary labels from human annotators. Our efforts resulted in the creation of four datasets: CLCIFAR10, CLCIFAR20, CLMicroImageNet10, and CLMicroImageNet20, derived from well-known classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200. These datasets represent the very first real-world CLL datasets, namely CLImage, which are publicly available at: https://github.com/ntucllab/CLImage\_Dataset. Through extensive benchmark experiments, we discovered a notable decrease in performance when transitioning from synthetically labeled datasets to real-world datasets. We investigated the key factors contributing to the decrease with a thorough dataset-level ablation study. Our analyses highlight annotation noise as the most influential factor in the real-world datasets. In addition, we discover that the biased-nature of human-annotated complementary labels and the difficulty to validate with only complementary labels are two outstanding barriers to practical CLL. These findings suggest that the community focus more research efforts on developing CLL algorithms and validation schemes that are robust to noisy and biased complementary-label distributions.

Abstract: We provide an implementation to compute the flat metric in any dimension. The flat metric, also called dual bounded Lipschitz distance, generalizes the well-known Wasserstein distance $W_1$ to the case that the distributions are of unequal total mass. Thus, our implementation adapts very well to mass differences and uses them to distinguish between different distributions. This is of particular interest for unbalanced optimal transport tasks and for the analysis of data distributions where the sample size is important or normalization is not possible. The core of the method is based on a neural network to determine an optimal test function realizing the distance between two given measures. Special focus was put on achieving comparability of pairwise computed distances from independently trained networks. We tested the quality of the output in several experiments where ground truth was available as well as with simulated data.

Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation is the statistical discrepancy between distinct treatment groups. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method for CATE estimation. First, we derive regret bounds for general data augmentation methods suggesting that a small imputation error may be necessary for accurate CATE estimation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a contrastive learning approach that reliably imputes missing potential outcomes for a selected subset of individuals formed using a similarity measure. We augment the original dataset with these reliable imputations to reduce the discrepancy between different treatment groups while inducing minimal imputation error. The augmented dataset can subsequently be employed to train standard CATE estimation models. We provide both theoretical guarantees and extensive numerical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of numerous CATE estimation models.

Abstract: In the rapidly growing literature on explanation algorithms, it often remains unclear what precisely these algorithms are for and how they should be used. In this position paper, we argue for a novel and pragmatic perspective: Explainable machine learning needs to recognize its parallels with applied statistics. Concretely, explanations are statistics of high-dimensional functions, and we should think about them analogously to traditional statistical quantities. Among others, this implies that we must think carefully about the matter of interpretation, or how the explanations relate to intuitive questions that humans have about the world. The fact that this is scarcely being discussed in research papers is one of the main drawbacks of the current literature. Moving forward, the analogy between explainable machine learning and applied statistics suggests fruitful ways for how research practices can be improved.

Abstract: Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.

Abstract: Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. In this paper, we present the first systematic classification framework for lane-level traffic prediction, offering a structured taxonomy and analysis of existing methods. We construct three representative datasets from two real-world road networks, covering both regular and irregular lane configurations, and make them publicly available to support future research. We further establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction task formulation, and proposes a simple yet effective baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. This unified framework enables consistent evaluation across datasets and modeling paradigms. We also reproduce previously unavailable code from existing studies and conduct extensive experiments to assess a range of models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability, providing the first benchmark that jointly considers predictive performance and training cost for lane-level traffic scenarios. All datasets and code are released at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/LaneLevel-Traffic-Benchmark.

Abstract: We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary demonstrations from experts who made their decisions based on unobserved contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different problems than what the learner faces. This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning with an unknown distribution over the unobserved contextual variables and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved variables are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), an empirical Bayes approach that utilizes expert data to establish an informative prior distribution over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior distribution enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning, online, and online-offline baselines for multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes (MDPs), and partially observable MDPs, showcasing the broad reach and utility of ExPerior in using expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven profound transformations in wireless networks. However, within wireless environments, the training of LLMs faces significant challenges related to security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL), with its decentralized architecture, offers enhanced data privacy protection. Nevertheless, when integrated with LLMs, FL still struggles with several critical limitations, including large-scale and heterogeneous data, resource-intensive training, and substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a systematic analysis of the distinct training stages of LLMs in wireless networks, including pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment tuning. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Personalized Wireless Federated Fine-tuning (PWFF) framework. Initially, we utilize the adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to decrease energy consumption, while employing global partial aggregation to reduce communication delay. Subsequently, we develop two reward models and design a personalized loss function to fulfill the goal of personalized learning. Furthermore, we implement a local multi-objective alignment to ensure the stability and effectiveness of the FL process. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to validate the performance of the proposed PWFF method and provide an in-depth discussion of the open issues.

Abstract: In Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) agents are tasked with optimising decision-making behaviours that trade-off between multiple, possibly conflicting, objectives. MORL based on decomposition is a family of solution methods that employ a number of utility functions to decompose the multi-objective problem into individual single-objective problems solved simultaneously in order to approximate a Pareto front of policies. We focus on the case of linear utility functions parametrised by weight vectors w. We introduce a method based on Upper Confidence Bound to efficiently search for the most promising weight vectors during different stages of the learning process, with the aim of maximising the hypervolume of the resulting Pareto front. The proposed method demonstrates consistency and strong performance across various MORL baselines on Mujoco benchmark problems. The code is released in: https://github.com/SYCAMORE-1/ucb-MOPPO

Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities, leading to habitat destruction, pollutant emissions, and biodiversity loss. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is crucial for mitigating these impacts and safeguarding both environmental and human health. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wildfire risk prediction methodologies, with a particular focus on deep learning approaches combined with remote sensing. We begin by defining wildfire risk and summarizing the geographical distribution of related studies. In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of feature collinearity assessment and model interpretability to improve the understanding of prediction outcomes. Regarding methodology, we classify deep learning models into three primary categories: time-series forecasting, image segmentation, and spatiotemporal prediction, and further discuss methods for converting model outputs into risk classifications or probability-adjusted predictions. Finally, we identify the key challenges and limitations of current wildfire-risk prediction models and outline several research opportunities. These include integrating diverse remote sensing data, developing multimodal models, designing more computationally efficient architectures, and incorporating cross-disciplinary methods--such as coupling with numerical weather-prediction models--to enhance the accuracy and robustness of wildfire-risk assessments.

Abstract: We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to jointly optimize wireless network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and 2. enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.

Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove the consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization this method may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.

Abstract: Determining the optimal model for a given task often requires training multiple models from scratch, which becomes impractical as dataset and model sizes grow. A more efficient alternative is to expand smaller pre-trained models, but this approach is underutilized due to a limited understanding of its impact on the training dynamics. Existing methods for quantifying this impact have notable limitations, including computation cost. To address this, we introduce a new perspective based on the loss landscape, which has been shown to contain a manifold of linearly connected minima. Specifically, we propose a metric that estimates the size of this manifold to study the impact of model expansion. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between performance gains and our manifold metric, enabling more informed model comparison and offering a first step toward a geometry-driven approach for reliable model expansion. Notably, our metric outperforms other baselines, even when different types of expansion with equivalent number of parameters are applied to a model.

<title>Does learning the right latent variables necessarily improve in-context learning?</title>

Abstract: Large autoregressive models like Transformers can solve tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without learning new weights, suggesting avenues for efficiently solving new tasks. For many tasks, e.g., linear regression, the data factorizes: examples are independent given a task latent that generates the data, e.g., linear coefficients. While an optimal predictor leverages this factorization by inferring task latents, it is unclear if Transformers implicitly do so or if they instead exploit heuristics and statistical shortcuts enabled by attention layers. Both scenarios have inspired active ongoing work. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of explicitly inferring task latents. We minimally modify the Transformer architecture with a bottleneck designed to prevent shortcuts in favor of more structured solutions, and then compare performance against standard Transformers across various ICL tasks. Contrary to intuition and some recent works, we find little discernible difference between the two; biasing towards task-relevant latent variables does not lead to better out-of-distribution performance, in general. Curiously, we find that while the bottleneck effectively learns to extract latent task variables from context, downstream processing struggles to utilize them for robust prediction. Our study highlights the intrinsic limitations of Transformers in achieving structured ICL solutions that generalize, and shows that while inferring the right latents aids interpretability, it is not sufficient to alleviate this problem.

Abstract: This paper focuses on extending the success of large language models (LLMs) to sequential decision making. Existing efforts either (i) re-train or finetune LLMs for decision making, or (ii) design prompts for pretrained LLMs. The former approach suffers from the computational burden of gradient updates, and the latter approach does not show promising results. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages online model selection algorithms to efficiently incorporate LLMs agents into sequential decision making. Statistically, our approach significantly outperforms both traditional decision making algorithms and vanilla LLM agents. Computationally, our approach avoids the need for expensive gradient updates of LLMs, and throughout the decision making process, it requires only a small number of LLM calls. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. As an example, on a large-scale Amazon dataset, our approach achieves more than a 6x performance gain over baselines while calling LLMs in only 1.5% of the time steps.

Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal for developing new medical treatments but typically carry risks such as patient mortality and enrollment failure that waste immense efforts spanning over a decade. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to predict key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of 23 meticulously curated AI-ready datasets covering multi-modal input features and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

<title>Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for V2X Communications</title>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication has attracted much attention due to its superior performance in coverage, latency, and throughput. Resource allocation within C-V2X is crucial for ensuring the transmission of safety information and meeting the stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and high reliability in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. This paper proposes a method that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address this challenge. By constructing a dynamic graph with communication links as nodes and employing the Graph Sample and Aggregation (GraphSAGE) model to adapt to changes in graph structure, the model aims to ensure a high success rate for V2V communication while minimizing interference on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links, thereby ensuring the successful transmission of V2V link information and maintaining high transmission rates for V2I links. The proposed method retains the global feature learning capabilities of GNN and supports distributed network deployment, allowing vehicles to extract low-dimensional features that include structural information from the graph network based on local observations and to make independent resource allocation decisions. Simulation results indicate that the introduction of GNN, with a modest increase in computational load, effectively enhances the decision-making quality of agents, demonstrating superiority to other methods. This study not only provides a theoretically efficient resource allocation strategy for V2V and V2I communications but also paves a new technical path for resource management in practical IoV environments.

Abstract: We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$, either in expectation or with constant probability. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time \textit{for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is the introduction of an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. Under the given assumption, we show that the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average-reward setting where the discount factor is $1$. Our algorithm design uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Thus, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Climate change stands as one of the most pressing global challenges of the twenty-first century, with far-reaching consequences such as rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and increasingly extreme weather patterns. Accurate forecasting is critical for monitoring these phenomena and supporting mitigation strategies. While recent data-driven models for time-series forecasting, including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers, have shown promise, they often struggle with sequential dependencies and limited parallelization, especially in long-horizon, multivariate meteorological datasets. In this work, we present Focal Modulated Attention Encoder (FATE), a novel transformer architecture designed for reliable multivariate time-series forecasting. Unlike conventional models, FATE introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that explicitly captures spatiotemporal correlations in time-series data. We further propose two modulation scores that offer interpretability by highlighting critical environmental features influencing predictions. We benchmark FATE across seven diverse real-world datasets including ETTh1, ETTm2, Traffic, Weather5k, USA-Canada, Europe, and LargeST datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, including temperature datasets. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that FATE generalizes well to broader multivariate time-series forecasting tasks. For reproducible research, code is released at https://github.com/Tajamul21/FATE.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tackling with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.

Moreover, we show that a generalized version of neural integral operators, based on the Gavurin integral, are universal approximators of arbitrary operators between Banach spaces. Lastly, we show that a modified version of transformer, which uses Leray-Schauder mappings, is a universal approximator of operators between arbitrary Banach spaces.

Abstract: Recently, the authors of \cite{SYZ22} developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons (and thus parameters) to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. More specifically, only $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ neurons or parameters are used. One natural question is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons or parameters in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, \textcolor{black}{we show that there is a composition of networks generated by the elementary universal activation function with at most $10889d + 10887$ nonzero parameters such that this super approximation property is attained. The composed network consists of repeated evaluations of two neural networks: one with width $36(2d+1)$ and the other with width 36, both having 5 layers.} Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and thus at least $d$ neurons or parameters, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This suggests that the number of nonzero parameters is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.

Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). If model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. Continual pre-training of OLMo-7B corroborates these results. Next, we study the impact of the weight decay parameter on example forgetting, showing that empirical forgetting occurs faster than the cumulative weight decay. This allows us to gauge the degree of example forgetting in large-scale training runs, indicating that many LLMs, including Lllama 3 405B, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.

Abstract: Graph generative models are essential across diverse scientific domains by capturing complex distributions over relational data. Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5-10% of their sampling steps.

Abstract: Attention layers are the core component of transformers, the current state-of-the-art neural network architecture. Alternatives to softmax-based attention are being explored due to its tendency to hinder effective information flow. Even at initialisation, it remains poorly understood why the propagation of signals and gradients through these random networks can be pathological, resulting in issues known as (i) vanishing/exploding gradients and (ii) rank collapse $\textit{in depth}$, i.e. when all tokens converge to a single representation along layers. While rank collapse in depth naturally arises from repeated matrix multiplications$\unicode{x2013}$a common pattern across various architectures$\unicode{x2013}$we identify an additional and previously unknown challenge unique to softmax attention layers: (iii) rank collapse $\textit{in width}$, which occurs as the context length increases. Using Random Matrix Theory, we conduct a rigorous analysis that uncovers a spectral gap between the two largest singular values of the attention matrix as the cause of (iii), which in turn exacerbates (i) and (ii). Building on this insight, we propose a novel yet simple practical solution to mitigate rank collapse in width by removing the outlier eigenvalue(s). Our theoretical framework offers a fresh perspective on recent practical studies, such as (Ye et al., 2024; Ali et al., 2023), whose ad hoc solutions can now be interpreted as implicit efforts to address the spectral gap issue. This work provides valuable theoretical support for ongoing large-scale empirical research, bringing theory and practice one step closer in the understanding of transformers.

Abstract: Reliable estimation of predictive uncertainty is crucial for machine learning applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where hedging against risks is essential. Despite its significance, there is no universal agreement on how to best quantify predictive uncertainty. In this work, we revisit core concepts to propose a framework for information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty. Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We extensively evaluate these measures across a broad set of tasks, identifying conditions under which certain measures excel. Our findings show the importance of aligning the choice of uncertainty measure with the predicting model on in-distribution (ID) data, the limitations of epistemic uncertainty measures for out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and that the disentanglement between measures varies substantially between ID and OOD data. Together, these insights provide a more comprehensive understanding of predictive uncertainty measures, revealing their implicit assumptions and relationships.

<title>Fast Second-Order Online Kernel Learning through Incremental Matrix Sketching and Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Online Kernel Learning (OKL) has attracted considerable research interest due to its promising predictive performance in streaming environments. Second-order approaches are particularly appealing for OKL as they often offer substantial improvements in regret guarantees. However, existing second-order OKL approaches suffer from at least quadratic time complexity with respect to the pre-set budget, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the real-time demands of large-scale streaming recommender systems. The singular value decomposition required to obtain explicit feature mapping is also computationally expensive due to the complete decomposition process. Moreover, the absence of incremental updates to manage approximate kernel space causes these algorithms to perform poorly in adversarial environments and real-world streaming recommendation datasets. To address these issues, we propose FORKS, a fast incremental matrix sketching and decomposition approach tailored for second-order OKL. FORKS constructs an incremental maintenance paradigm for second-order kernelized gradient descent, which includes incremental matrix sketching for kernel approximation and incremental matrix decomposition for explicit feature mapping construction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FORKS achieves a logarithmic regret guarantee on par with other second-order approaches while maintaining a linear time complexity w.r.t. the budget, significantly enhancing efficiency over existing approaches. We validate the performance of FORKS through extensive experiments conducted on real-world streaming recommendation datasets, demonstrating its superior scalability and robustness against adversarial attacks.

<title>Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Compositional Generalization: Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Foundations of Optimal Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have gained prominence for their ability to scale neural networks, particularly transformers, without a proportional increase in computational cost. Despite their success, their role in compositional generalization, i.e., adapting to novel combinations of known components, remains under-explored. This study challenges the assumption that minimal expert activation suffices for task generalization and investigates the relationship between task complexity and optimal sparsity in SMoE models. Through empirical evaluations on the SRAVEN symbolic reasoning task and the SKILL-MIX benchmark, we demonstrate that (i) the number of activated experts consistently increases with the perceived task difficulty to maintain performance; and (ii) the optimal number of activated experts scales proportionally with task complexity. Our theoretical analysis derives a scaling law for optimal sparsity by balancing approximation and estimation errors, revealing alignment with empirical observations. We formally show that the optimal sparsity lies between minimal activation (1-2 experts) and full activation, with the exact number scaling proportionally to task complexity and further influenced by the size of the training data and the complexity of the model. These findings offer practical insights for designing SMoE models that achieve computational efficiency while enabling robust compositional generalization.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of quantifying diversity for a set of objects. First, we conduct a systematic review of existing diversity measures and explore their undesirable behavior in certain cases. Based on this review, we formulate three desirable properties (axioms) of a reliable diversity measure: monotonicity, uniqueness, and continuity. We show that none of the existing measures has all three properties and thus these measures are not suitable for quantifying diversity. Then, we construct two examples of measures that have all the desirable properties, thus proving that the list of axioms is not self-contradictory. Unfortunately, the constructed examples are too computationally expensive (NP-hard) for practical use. Thus, we pose an open problem of constructing a diversity measure that has all the listed properties and can be computed in practice or proving that all such measures are NP-hard to compute.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. While numerous successful adversarial attacks have been proposed, defenses against these attacks remain relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on negating the effects of perturbations caused by the attacks to restore the DNNs' original predictions or use a secondary model to detect adversarial examples. However, these methods often become ineffective due to the continuous advancements in attack techniques. We propose a novel universal and lightweight method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the layer outputs of DNNs. Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples. Through theoretical justification and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.

<title>An Auditing Test To Detect Behavioral Shift in Language Models</title>

Abstract: As language models (LMs) approach human-level performance, a comprehensive understanding of their behavior becomes crucial. This includes evaluating capabilities, biases, task performance, and alignment with societal values. Extensive initial evaluations, including red teaming and diverse benchmarking, can establish a model's behavioral profile. However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present a method for continual Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs. Building on recent work in hypothesis testing, our auditing test detects behavioral shifts solely through model generations. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases. We evaluate our approach using two case studies: monitoring changes in (a) toxicity and (b) translation performance. We find that the test is able to detect meaningful changes in behavior distributions using just hundreds of examples.

Abstract: The development of large language models and multi-modal models has enabled the appealing idea of generating novel molecules from text descriptions. Generative modeling would shift the paradigm from relying on large-scale chemical screening to find molecules with desired properties to directly generating those molecules. However, multi-modal models combining text and molecules are often trained from scratch, without leveraging existing high-quality pretrained models. Training from scratch consumes more computational resources and prohibits model scaling. In contrast, we propose a lightweight adapter-based strategy named Chemical Language Model Linker (ChemLML). ChemLML blends the two single domain models and obtains conditional molecular generation from text descriptions while still operating in the specialized embedding spaces of the molecular domain. ChemLML can tailor diverse pretrained text models for molecule generation by training relatively few adapter parameters. We find that the choice of molecular representation used within ChemLML, SMILES versus SELFIES, has a strong influence on conditional molecular generation performance. SMILES is often preferable despite not guaranteeing valid molecules. We raise issues in using the entire PubChem dataset of molecules and their associated descriptions for evaluating molecule generation and provide a filtered version of the dataset as a generation test set. To demonstrate how ChemLML could be used in practice, we generate candidate protein inhibitors and use docking to assess their quality and also generate candidate membrane permeable molecules.

Abstract: Humans excel at learning abstract patterns across different sequences, filtering out irrelevant details, and transferring these generalized concepts to new sequences. In contrast, many sequence learning models lack the ability to abstract, which leads to memory inefficiency and poor transfer. We introduce a non-parametric hierarchical variable learning model (HVM) that learns chunks from sequences and abstracts contextually similar chunks as variables. HVM efficiently organizes memory while uncovering abstractions, leading to compact sequence representations. When learning on language datasets such as babyLM, HVM learns a more efficient dictionary than standard compression algorithms such as Lempel-Ziv. In a sequence recall task requiring the acquisition and transfer of variables embedded in sequences, we demonstrate HVM's sequence likelihood correlates with human recall times. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) struggle to transfer abstract variables as effectively as humans. From HVM's adjustable layer of abstraction, we demonstrate that the model realizes a precise trade-off between compression and generalization. Our work offers a cognitive model that captures the learning and transfer of abstract representations in human cognition and differentiates itself from LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for improving large language and multimodal model performance. However, it is still an open question under which settings CoT systematically reduces performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, focusing on six representative tasks from the psychological literature where deliberation hurts performance in humans. In three of these tasks, state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance drop-offs with CoT (up to 36.3\% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o), while in others, CoT effects are mixed, with positive, neutral, and negative changes. While models and humans do not exhibit perfectly parallel cognitive processes, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for humans helps identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human verbal thinking and deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a perspective for understanding the impact of inference-time reasoning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks and common corruptions, which undermine their robustness. In order to enhance model resilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a prominent solution. Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at the expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise robustness of the model. While distinctive classes become more robust towards such adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer. Recently, research has focused on improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the accuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data. Additionally, despite their robustness against the adversaries encountered during model training, state-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining robustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions. In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing a novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT). We show that using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of untargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to adversarial fairness. Empirical results validate the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: The best arm identification problem requires identifying the best alternative (i.e., arm) in active experimentation using the smallest number of experiments (i.e., arm pulls), which is crucial for cost-efficient and timely decision-making processes. In the fixed confidence setting, an algorithm must stop data-dependently and return the estimated best arm with a correctness guarantee. Since this stopping time is random, we desire its distribution to have light tails. Unfortunately, many existing studies focus on high probability or in expectation bounds on the stopping time, which allow heavy tails and, for high probability bounds, even not stopping at all. We first prove that this never-stopping event can indeed happen for some popular algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that provably enjoy an exponential-tailed stopping time, which improves upon the polynomial tail bound reported by Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012). The first algorithm is based on a fixed budget algorithm called Sequential Halving along with a doubling trick. The second algorithm is a meta algorithm that takes in any fixed confidence algorithm with a high probability stopping guarantee and turns it into one that enjoys an exponential-tailed stopping time. Our results imply that there is much more to be desired for contemporary fixed confidence algorithms.

Abstract: Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/

Abstract: While LLMs have grown popular in sequence labeling, linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) remain a popular alternative with the ability to directly model interactions between labels. However, the Markov assumption limits them to % only directly modeling interactions between adjacent labels. Weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs), in contrast, can model distant label--label interactions, but exact label inference is intractable in general. In this work, we present regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs (RPCRFs), a method of enriching standard linear-chain CRFs with the ability to learn long-distance label interactions through user-specified patterns. This approach allows users to write regular-expression label patterns concisely specifying which types of interactions the model should take into account, allowing the model to learn from data whether and in which contexts these patterns occur. The result can be interpreted alternatively as a CRF augmented with additional, non-local potentials, or as a finite-state transducer whose structure is defined by a set of easily-interpretable patterns. Critically, exact training and inference are tractable for many pattern sets. We detail how an RPCRF can be automatically constructed from a set of user-specified patterns, and demonstrate the model's effectiveness on a sequence of three synthetic sequence modeling datasets.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to automatically uncover causal relationships from data, a capability with significant potential across many scientific disciplines. However, its real-world applications remain limited. Current methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions and are evaluated only on simple synthetic toy datasets, often with inadequate evaluation metrics. In this paper, we substantiate these claims by performing a systematic review of the recent causal discovery literature. We present applications in biology, neuroscience, and Earth sciences - fields where causal discovery holds promise for addressing key challenges. We highlight available simulated and real-world datasets from these domains and discuss common assumption violations that have spurred the development of new methods. Our goal is to encourage the community to adopt better evaluation practices by utilizing realistic datasets and more adequate metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

Abstract: Shortcut learning, i.e., a model's reliance on undesired features not directly relevant to the task, is a major challenge that severely limits the applications of machine learning algorithms, particularly when deploying them to assist in making sensitive decisions, such as in medical diagnostics. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning to create an unsupervised framework that is capable of both detecting and mitigating shortcut learning in transformers. We validate our method on multiple datasets. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both worst-group accuracy (samples misclassified due to shortcuts) and average accuracy, while minimizing human annotation effort. Moreover, we demonstrate that the detected shortcuts are meaningful and informative to human experts, and that our framework is computationally efficient, allowing it to be run on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology enables information exchange between vehicles and road infrastructure. Specifically, when a vehicle approaches a roadside unit (RSU), it can exchange information with the RSU to obtain accurate data that assists in driving. With the release of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16, which includes the 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standards, vehicles typically adopt mode-2 communication using sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) for resource allocation. In this approach, vehicles identify candidate resources within a selection window and exclude ineligible resources based on information from a sensing window. However, vehicles often drive at different speeds, resulting in varying amounts of data transmission with RSUs as they pass by, which leads to unfair access. Therefore, it is essential to design an access scheme that accounts for different vehicle speeds to achieve fair access across the network. This paper formulates an optimization problem for vehicular networks and proposes a multi-objective optimization scheme to address it by adjusting the selection window in the SPS mechanism of 5G NR V2I mode-2. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme

Abstract: Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances applicable input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for output interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.

Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved promising results in solving online 3D Bin Packing Problems (3D-BPP). However, these DRL-based policies may perform poorly on new instances due to distribution shift. Besides generalization, we also consider adaptation, completely overlooked by previous work, which aims at rapidly fine-tuning these policies to a new test distribution. To tackle both generalization and adaptation issues, we propose ASAP, which decomposes a solver's decision-making into two policies, one for proposal and one for selection. The role of the proposal policy is to suggest promising actions, which allows the selection policy to choose among them. To effectively learn these policies, we introduce a training framework that combines pre-training and post-training, enhanced by meta-learning. During online adaptation, we only fine-tune the selection policy to rapidly adapt to a test distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAP exhibits excellent generalization and adaptation capabilities on in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances for both discrete and continuous setups.

Abstract: World models represent a promising approach for training reinforcement learning agents with significantly improved sample efficiency. While most world model methods primarily rely on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics, this compression often neglects critical visual details essential for reinforcement learning. Recent diffusion-based world models condition generation on a fixed context length of frames to predict the next observation, using separate recurrent neural networks to model rewards and termination signals. Although this architecture effectively enhances visual fidelity, the fixed context length approach inherently limits memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce EDELINE, a unified world model architecture that integrates state space models with diffusion models. Our approach outperforms existing baselines across visually challenging Atari 100k tasks, memory-demanding Crafter benchmark, and 3D first-person ViZDoom environments, demonstrating superior performance in all these diverse challenges.

Abstract: Plasticity loss, a critical challenge in neural network training, limits a model's ability to adapt to new tasks or shifts in data distribution. This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.

Abstract: Sample inefficiency is a long-lasting challenge in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Despite dramatic improvements have been made, the problem is far from being solved and is especially challenging in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. In our work, we propose to use Adversarial Estimates as a new, simple and efficient approach to mitigate this problem for a class of feedback-based DRL algorithms. Our approach leverages latent similarity search from a small set of human-collected trajectories to boost learning, using only five minutes of human-recorded experience. The results of our study show algorithms trained with Adversarial Estimates converge faster than their original version. Moreover, we discuss how our approach could enable learning in feedback-based algorithms in extreme scenarios with very sparse rewards.

Abstract: From extracting features to generating text, the outputs of large language models (LLMs) typically rely on the final layers, following the conventional wisdom that earlier layers capture only low-level cues. However, our analysis shows that intermediate layers can encode even richer representations, often improving performance on a range of downstream tasks. To explain and quantify these hidden-layer properties, we propose a unified framework of representation quality metrics based on information theory, geometry, and invariance to input perturbations. Our framework highlights how each layer balances information compression and signal preservation, revealing why mid-depth embeddings can exceed the last layer's performance. Through extensive experiments on 32 text-embedding tasks across various architectures (transformers, state-space models) and domains (language, vision), we demonstrate that intermediate layers consistently provide stronger features, challenging the standard view on final-layer embeddings and opening new directions on using mid-layer representations for more robust and accurate representations.

Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive, often requiring months of training time even with high-end GPU clusters. There are two approaches of mitigating such computational demands: reusing smaller models to train larger ones (upcycling), and training computationally efficient models like mixture-of-experts (MoE). In this paper, we study the upcycling of LLMs to MoE models, of which the scaling behavior remains underexplored. Through extensive experiments, we identify empirical scaling laws that describe how performance depends on dataset size and model configuration. Particularly, we show that, while scaling these factors improves performance, there is a novel interaction term between the dense and upcycled training dataset that limits the efficiency of upcycling at large computational budgets. Based on these findings, we provide guidance to scale upcycling, and establish conditions under which upcycling outperforms from-scratch trainings within budget constraints.

<title>The Other Side of the Coin: Unveiling the Downsides of Model Aggregation in Federated Learning from a Layer-peeled Perspective</title>

Abstract: It is often observed that the aggregated model in FL underperforms on local data until after several rounds of local training. This temporary performance drop can potentially slow down the convergence of the FL model. Prior work regards this performance drop as an inherent cost of knowledge sharing among clients and does not give it special attention. While some studies directly focus on designing techniques to alleviate the issue, its root causes remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we construct a framework that enables layer-peeled analysis of how feature representations evolve during model aggregation in FL. It focuses on two key aspects: (1) the intrinsic quality of extracted features, and (2) the alignment between features and their subsequent parameters -- both of which are critical to downstream performance. Using this framework, we first investigate how model aggregation affects internal feature extraction process. Our analysis reveals that aggregation degrades feature quality and weakens the coupling between intermediate features and subsequent layers, both of which are well shaped during local training. More importantly, this degradation is not confined to specific layers but progressively accumulates with network depth -- a phenomenon we term Cumulative Feature Degradation (CFD). CFD significantly impairs the quality of penultimate-layer features and weakens their coupling with the classifier, ultimately degrading model performance. We further revisit several widely adopted solutions through the lens of layer-peeled feature extraction to understand why they are effective in addressing aggregation-induced performance drop. Our results show that their effectiveness lies in mitigating the feature degradation described above, which is well aligned with our observations.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks. The official code is released at https://github.com/research4pan/AdaptPruner.

Abstract: As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands rapidly, ensuring secure networks to defend against diverse cyber threats becomes increasingly vital. This study addresses the limitations of multi-class attack detection in IoT devices by proposing new, lightweight ensemble methods grounded in robust machine learning frameworks. Leveraging the CICIoT 2023 dataset which features 34 distinct attack types across 10 categories. We systematically evaluated a wide array of contemporary machine learning algorithms to identify the optimal choice for safeguarding IoT environments. Focusing on classifier-based approaches, our research addresses the complex and heterogeneous nature of attack vectors found in IoT ecosystems. Among the evaluated models, the Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance, with 99.56\% accuracy and a 99.62\% F1 score, demonstrating strong, reliable threat detection capabilities. The Random Forest algorithm followed closely, attaining 98.22\% accuracy and a 98.24\% F1 score, further highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning in handling high-dimensional data. These findings underscore the significant promise of incorporating machine learning classifiers into IoT security defenses and inspire further exploration into scalable, keystroke-based attack detection. Our approach offers a novel pathway for developing sophisticated algorithms for resource-constrained IoT devices, achieving a critical balance between accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this work advances the field of IoT security by establishing a strong baseline and framework for the development of intelligent, adaptive security measures suitable for evolving IoT landscapes.

Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing sequential approximate verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This reduces the number of calls to the larger LLM, achieving further speedups and lower computation cost. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency.

Abstract: Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of temperature's role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) seek to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep learning. Mainstream approaches that deploy fully-connected multi-layer deep learning architectures require prolonged training to achieve even moderate accuracy, while recent work on feature engineering allows higher accuracy and faster convergence. This paper introduces SAFE-NET, a Single-layered Adaptive Feature Engineering NETwork that achieves orders-of-magnitude lower errors with far fewer parameters than baseline feature engineering methods. SAFE-NET returns to basic ideas in machine learning, using Fourier features, a simplified single hidden layer network architecture, and an effective optimizer that improves the conditioning of the PINN optimization problem. Numerical results show that SAFE-NET converges faster and typically outperforms deeper networks and more complex architectures. It consistently uses fewer parameters -- on average, 65% fewer than the competing feature engineering methods -- while achieving comparable accuracy in less than 30% of the training epochs. Moreover, each SAFE-NET epoch is 95% faster than those of competing feature engineering approaches. These findings challenge the prevailing belief that modern PINNs effectively learn features in these scientific applications and highlight the efficiency gains possible through feature engineering.

Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.

Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.

Abstract: Representation learning produces models in different domains, such as store purchases, client transactions, and general people's behaviour. However, such models for event sequences usually process each sequence in isolation, ignoring context from ones that co-occur in time. This limitation is particularly problematic in domains with fast-evolving conditions, like finance and e-commerce, or when certain sequences lack recent events.
  We develop a method that aggregates information from multiple user representations, augmenting a specific user for a scenario of multiple co-occurring event sequences, achieving better quality than processing each sequence independently. Our study considers diverse aggregation approaches, ranging from simple pooling techniques to trainable attention-based Kernel attention aggregation, that can highlight more complex information flow from other users. The proposed methods operate on top of an existing encoder and support its efficient fine-tuning. Across six diverse event sequence datasets (finance, e-commerce, education, etc.) and downstream tasks, Kernel attention improves ROC-AUC scores, both with and without fine-tuning, while mean pooling yields a smaller but still significant gain.

Abstract: While increasing training compute has significantly improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), similar gains have not been observed when scaling inference compute. We hypothesize that the primary issue lies in the uniformity of LLM outputs, which leads to inefficient sampling as models repeatedly generate similar but inaccurate responses. Motivated by an intriguing relationship between solution accuracy and response diversity, we propose DivSampling -- a novel and versatile sampling technique designed to enhance the diversity of candidate solutions by introducing prompt perturbations.DivSampling incorporates two categories of perturbations: task-agnostic approaches, which are general and not tailored to any specific task, and task-specific approaches, which are customized based on task content. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the error rates of responses generated from diverse prompts are significantly lower compared to those produced by stationary prompts. Comprehensive evaluations across various tasks -- including reasoning, mathematics, and code generation -- highlight the effectiveness of DivSampling in improving solution accuracy. This scalable and efficient approach offers a new perspective on optimizing test-time inference, addressing limitations in current sampling strategies.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has been a critical topic in contemporary deep neural network applications, where higher levels of both forward and backward transfer are desirable for an effective CL performance. Existing CL strategies primarily focus on task models, either by regularizing model updates or by separating task-specific and shared components, while often overlooking the potential of leveraging inter-task relationships to enhance transfer. To address this gap, we propose a transferability-aware task embedding, termed H-embedding, and construct a hypernet framework under its guidance to learn task-conditioned model weights for CL tasks. Specifically, H-embedding is derived from an information theoretic measure of transferability and is designed to be online and easy to compute. Our method is also characterized by notable practicality, requiring only the storage of a low-dimensional task embedding per task and supporting efficient end-to-end training. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet show that our framework performs prominently compared to various baseline and SOTA approaches, demonstrating strong potential in capturing and utilizing intrinsic task relationships. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/H-embedding_guided_hypernet/.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has demonstrated effectiveness in solving NP-complete (NPC) problems by learning discrete diffusion models for solution generation, eliminating hand-crafted domain knowledge. Despite their success, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in both cross-scale and cross-problem generalization, and high training costs compared to traditional solvers. While recent studies on diffusion models have introduced training-free guidance approaches that leverage pre-defined guidance functions for conditional generation, such methodologies have not been extensively explored in combinatorial optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free inference time adaptation framework (DIFU-Ada) that enables both the zero-shot cross-problem transfer and cross-scale generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical analysis that helps understanding the cross-problem transfer capability. Our experimental results demonstrate that a diffusion solver, trained exclusively on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), can achieve competitive zero-shot transfer performance across different problem scales on TSP variants, such as Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP) and the Orienteering Problem (OP), through inference time adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in question answering (QA), but metrics for assessing their reliance on memorization versus retrieval remain underdeveloped. Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To further mitigate the noise in different reward models, we propose a Bayesian Aggregation approach that unifies multiple margin sources (external and implicit) into a single preference probability. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the consistently high data efficiency of our approach. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, revealing the high redundancy in this presumed high-quality data construction manner. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.

<title>Optimal Transport-Guided Safety in Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance, frequently without considering safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning seeks to reduce or avoid unsafe behavior. This paper views safety as taking actions with more predictable consequences under environment stochasticity and introduces a temporal difference algorithm that uses optimal transport theory to quantify the uncertainty associated with actions. By integrating this uncertainty score into the decision-making objective, the agent is encouraged to favor actions with more predictable outcomes. We theoretically prove that our algorithm leads to a reduction in the probability of visiting unsafe states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on several case studies in the presence of various forms of environment uncertainty. The results demonstrate that our method not only provides safer behavior but also maintains the performance. A Python implementation of our algorithm is available at \href{https://github.com/SAILRIT/Risk-averse-TD-Learning}{https://github.com/SAILRIT/OT-guided-TD-Learning}.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem (KAT), or more generally, the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST), establishes that any non-linear multivariate function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of non-linear univariate functions. Unlike the universal approximation theorem, which provides only an approximate representation without guaranteeing a fixed network size, KST offers a theoretically exact decomposition. The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was introduced as a trainable model to implement KAT, and recent advancements have adapted KAN using concepts from modern neural networks. However, KAN struggles to effectively model physical systems that require inherent equivariance or invariance geometric symmetries as $E(3)$ transformations, a key property for many scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we propose a novel extension of KAT and KAN to incorporate equivariance and invariance over various group actions, including $O(n)$, $O(1,n)$, $S_n$, and general $GL$, enabling accurate and efficient modeling of these systems. Our approach provides a unified approach that bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practical architectures for physical systems, expanding the applicability of KAN to a broader class of problems. We provide experimental validation on molecular dynamical systems and particle physics.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (\texttt{DPO}) has emerged as a promising approach for solving the alignment problem in AI. In this paper, we make two counter-intuitive observations about \texttt{DPO}. First, we show that \texttt{DPO} loss could be derived by starting from an alternative optimization problem that only defines the KL guardrail on in-sample responses, unlike the original RLHF problem where guardrails are defined on the entire distribution. Second, we prove a surprising property of this alternative optimization problem, namely that under its optimal policy, both preferred and rejected responses tend to decrease in probability, a phenomenon typically displayed by DPO in practice. To control this behavior, we propose a set of constraints designed to limit the displacement of probability mass between the preferred and rejected responses in the reference and target policies. The resulting algorithm, which we call Constrained Controlled DPO (\texttt{C2-DPO}), has a meaningful RLHF interpretation. By hedging against the displacement, \texttt{C2-DPO} provides practical improvements over vanilla \texttt{DPO} when aligning several language models using standard preference datasets.

Abstract: Large-scale machine learning models deliver strong performance across a wide range of tasks but come with significant computational and resource constraints. To mitigate these challenges, local smaller models are often deployed alongside larger models, relying on routing and deferral mechanisms to offload complex tasks. However, existing approaches inadequately balance the capabilities of these models, often resulting in unnecessary deferrals or sub-optimal resource usage. In this work we introduce a novel loss function called Gatekeeper for calibrating smaller models in cascade setups. Our approach fine-tunes the smaller model to confidently handle tasks it can perform correctly while deferring complex tasks to the larger model. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism for managing the trade-off between model performance and deferral accuracy, and is broadly applicable across various tasks and domains without any architectural changes. We evaluate our method on encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures. Experiments across image classification, language modeling, and vision-language tasks show that our approach substantially improves deferral performance.

Abstract: Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods often struggle with sharp curvatures, intricate geometries, and multimodal distributions. Slice sampling can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues, and Riemannian geometries help with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds, but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in a closed form. We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions to differential equations. Our approach enables the exploration of the regions with strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions. We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.

Abstract: Divergence-free symmetric tensors (DFSTs) are fundamental in continuum mechanics, encoding conservation laws such as mass and momentum conservation. We introduce Riemann Tensor Neural Networks (RTNNs), a novel neural architecture that inherently satisfies the DFST condition to machine precision, providing a strong inductive bias for enforcing these conservation laws. We prove that RTNNs can approximate any sufficiently smooth DFST with arbitrary precision and demonstrate their effectiveness as surrogates for conservative PDEs, achieving improved accuracy across benchmarks. This work is the first to use DFSTs as an inductive bias in neural PDE surrogates and to explicitly enforce the conservation of both mass and momentum within a physics-constrained neural architecture.

Abstract: Machine learning systems struggle with robustness, under subpopulation shifts. This problem becomes especially pronounced in scenarios where only a subset of attribute combinations is observed during training -a severe form of subpopulation shift, referred as compositional shift. To address this problem, we ask the following question: Can we improve the robustness by training on synthetic data, spanning all possible attribute combinations? We first show that training of conditional diffusion models on limited data lead to incorrect underlying distribution. Therefore, synthetic data sampled from such models will result in unfaithful samples and does not lead to improve performance of downstream machine learning systems. To address this problem, we propose CoInD to reflect the compositional nature of the world by enforcing conditional independence through minimizing Fisher's divergence between joint and marginal distributions. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated by CoInD is faithful and this translates to state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy on compositional shift tasks on CelebA.

Abstract: Water quality is foundational to environmental sustainability, ecosystem resilience, and public health. Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offer transformative potential for large-scale water quality prediction and scientific insights generation. However, their widespread adoption in high-stakes decision-making, such as pollution mitigation and equitable resource allocation, is prevented by unresolved trustworthiness challenges including fairness, uncertainty, interpretability, robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of trustworthiness in a continental-scale multi-task LSTM model predicting 20 water quality variables (encompassing physical/chemical processes, geochemical weathering, and nutrient cycling) across 482 U.S. basins. Our investigation uncovers systematic patterns of model performance disparities linked to basin characteristics, the inherent complexity of biogeochemical processes, and variable predictability, emphasizing critical performance fairness concerns. We further propose methodological frameworks for quantitatively evaluating critical aspects of trustworthiness, including uncertainty, interpretability, and robustness, identifying key limitations that could challenge reliable real-world deployment. This work serves as a timely call to action for advancing trustworthy data-driven methods for water resources management and provides a pathway to offering critical insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners seeking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly in environmental management.

Abstract: Scaling laws are a critical component of the LLM development pipeline, most famously as a way to forecast training decisions such as 'compute-optimally' trading-off parameter count and dataset size, alongside a more recent growing list of other crucial decisions. In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact compute-optimal parameter count by nearly 50%, depending on its skill composition.

Abstract: Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables collaborative learning while preserving data privacy by preventing direct data exchange between agents. However, many existing FedRL algorithms assume that all agents operate in identical environments, which is often unrealistic. In real-world applications, such as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor networks, each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics, leading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear convergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in policy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent suffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value function. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes. We then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where multiple agents, each interacting with its own perturbed environment, periodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true value function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate the impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the convergence of FedTD(0). Empirical experiments corroborate our theoretical gains, highlighting that even moderate levels of information sharing significantly mitigate environment-specific errors.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.

Abstract: Numerous applications of large language models (LLMs) rely on their ability to perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the reasoning behavior of LLMs remains poorly understood, posing challenges to research, development, and safety. To address this gap, we introduce landscape of thoughts-the first visualization tool for users to inspect the reasoning paths of chain-of-thought and its derivatives on any multi-choice dataset. Specifically, we represent the states in a reasoning path as feature vectors that quantify their distances to all answer choices. These features are then visualized in two-dimensional plots using t-SNE. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with the landscape of thoughts effectively distinguishes between strong and weak models, correct and incorrect answers, as well as different reasoning tasks. It also uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high uncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt our tool to a model that predicts the property they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting our tool to a lightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of reasoning paths. Empirically, this verifier boosts the accuracy of reasoning as well as the test-time scaling effect. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/landscape-of-thoughts.

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate tree-indexed Markov chains (Gibbs measures) defined by a Hamiltonian that couples two Ising layers: hidden spins \(s(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) and observed spins \(\sigma(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) on a Cayley tree. The Hamiltonian incorporates Ising interactions within each layer and site-wise emission couplings between layers, extending hidden Markov models to a bilayer Markov random field.
  Specifically, we explore translation-invariant Gibbs measures (TIGM) of this Hamiltonian on Cayley trees.
  Under certain explicit conditions on the model's parameters, we demonstrate that there can be up to three distinct TIGMs. Each of these measures represents an equilibrium state of the spin system. These measures provide a structured approach to inference on hierarchical data in machine learning. They have practical applications in tasks such as denoising, weakly supervised learning, and anomaly detection. The Cayley tree structure is particularly advantageous for exact inference due to its tractability.

Abstract: Active automata learning infers automaton models of systems from behavioral observations, a technique successfully applied to a wide range of domains. Compositional approaches for concurrent systems have recently emerged. We take a significant step beyond available results, including those by the authors, and develop a general technique for compositional learning of a synchronizing parallel system with an unknown decomposition. Our approach automatically refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while learning the component models. We develop a theoretical treatment of distributions of alphabets, i.e., sets of possibly overlapping component alphabets. We characterize counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies with global observations, and show how to systematically update the distribution to restore consistency. We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these ideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution counterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation, called CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our experiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders of magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in systems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in the number of equivalence queries.

<title>PARD: Accelerating LLM Inference with Low-Cost PARallel Draft Model Adaptation</title>

Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x, achieving 311.5 tokens per second.

Abstract: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

<title>ICE-Pruning: An Iterative Cost-Efficient Pruning Pipeline for Deep Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size. However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components. We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/ICE-Pruning

Abstract: Model merging provides a scalable alternative to multi-task training by combining specialized finetuned models through parameter arithmetic, enabling efficient deployment without the need for joint training or access to all task data. While recent methods have shown promise, existing evaluations are limited in both model scale and task diversity, leaving open questions about their applicability to large, domain-specialized LLMs. To tackle the challenges, we introduce MergeBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess model merging at scale. MergeBench builds on state-of-the-art open-source language models, including Llama and Gemma families at 2B to 9B scales, and covers five key domains: instruction following, mathematics, multilingual understanding, coding and safety. We standardize finetuning and evaluation protocols, and assess eight representative merging methods across multi-task performance, forgetting and runtime efficiency. Based on extensive experiments, we provide practical guidelines for algorithm selection and share insights showing that model merging tends to perform better on stronger base models, with techniques such as merging coefficient tuning and sparsification improving knowledge retention. However, several challenges remain, including the computational cost on large models, the gap for in-domain performance compared to multi-task models, and the underexplored role of model merging in standard LLM training pipelines. We hope MergeBench provides a foundation for future research to advance the understanding and practical application of model merging.

Abstract: This paper introduces a formal notion of fixed point explanations, inspired by the "why regress" principle, to assess, through recursive applications, the stability of the interplay between a model and its explainer. Fixed point explanations satisfy properties like minimality, stability, and faithfulness, revealing hidden model behaviours and explanatory weaknesses. We define convergence conditions for several classes of explainers, from feature-based to mechanistic tools like Sparse AutoEncoders, and we report quantitative and qualitative results.

<title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPI), a novel framework that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score transporter into the calibration process, SPI provably achieves finite-sample coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPI yields substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification -- augmenting data with synthetic diffusion-model generated images -- and on tabular regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures, and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation, offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research directions to address them.

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks. This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&amp;M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&amp;M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&amp;M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders (GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability. Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements, such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders (GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors (ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical, and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination (AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance [AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However, the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care, inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for haemorrhagic stroke.

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap, we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms. We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal graph classification experiment.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3 dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

<title>MTL-KD: Multi-Task Learning Via Knowledge Distillation for Generalizable Neural Vehicle Routing Solver</title>

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is a promising approach to train a unified model capable of solving multiple Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.

Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.

Abstract: Sparsifying neural networks often suffers from seemingly inevitable performance degradation, and it remains challenging to restore the original performance despite much recent progress. Motivated by recent studies in robust optimization, we aim to tackle this problem by finding subnetworks that are both sparse and flat at the same time. Specifically, we formulate pruning as a sparsity-constrained optimization problem where flatness is encouraged as an objective. We solve it explicitly via an augmented Lagrange dual approach and extend it further by proposing a generalized projection operation, resulting in novel pruning methods called SAFE and its extension, SAFE$^+$. Extensive evaluations on standard image classification and language modeling tasks reveal that SAFE consistently yields sparse networks with improved generalization performance, which compares competitively to well-established baselines. In addition, SAFE demonstrates resilience to noisy data, making it well-suited for real-world conditions.

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.

<title>SALT: A Lightweight Model Adaptation Method for Closed Split Computing Environments</title>

Abstract: We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model adaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the head and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such closed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they require access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this challenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to refine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation without modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We evaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared to fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for robust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud environments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical solution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system constraints.

Abstract: Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects millions worldwide, requiring continuous monitoring to prevent severe hypo- and hyperglycemic events. While continuous glucose monitoring has improved blood glucose management, deploying predictive models on wearable devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight Sequential Transformer model designed for blood glucose prediction in T1D. By integrating the strengths of Transformers' attention mechanisms and the sequential processing of recurrent neural networks, our architecture captures long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is optimized for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices and incorporates a balanced loss function to handle the inherent data imbalance in hypo- and hyperglycemic events. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, OhioT1DM and DiaTrend, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting glucose levels and detecting adverse events. This work fills the gap between high-performance modeling and practical deployment, providing a reliable and efficient T1D management solution.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.

Like conformal prediction, the conformal risk control procedure is tight up to an $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ factor. We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score.

Abstract: Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.

Abstract: Biometric recognition as an efficient and hard-to-forge way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integration into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received by both research and industry in the past few years, and it is being increasingly deployed today in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate on the pros and cons and what the best applications would be when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of the research literature on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration based on GDPR to shed light on challenges and potentials. Although the integration of blockchain technology into the biometric sector is still in its infancy, with a growing body of literature discussing specific applications and advanced technological setups, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of blockchain applicability in biometrics. Based on published studies, this article discusses, among others, practical examples combining blockchain and biometrics for novel applications in PKI systems, distributed trusted services, and identity management. Challenges and limitations when combining blockchain and biometrics that motivate future work will also be discussed; e.g., blockchain networks at their current stage may not be efficient or economical for some real-time biometric applications. Finally, we also discuss key legal aspects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) related to this combination of technologies (blockchain and biometrics); for example, accountability, immutability, anonymity, and data protection elements.

Abstract: The computation of equilibrium prices at which the supply of goods matches their demand typically relies on complete information on agents' private attributes, e.g., suppliers' cost functions, which are often unavailable in practice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we consider the problem of learning equilibrium prices over a horizon of $T$ periods in the incomplete information setting wherein a market operator seeks to satisfy the customer demand for a commodity by purchasing it from competing suppliers with cost functions unknown to the operator. We first consider the setting when suppliers' cost functions are fixed and develop algorithms that, on three pertinent regret metrics, simultaneously achieve a regret of $O(1)$ when the customer demand is constant over time, and $O(\sqrt{T})$ when the demand varies over time. In the setting when the suppliers' cost functions vary over time, we demonstrate that, in general, no online algorithm can achieve sublinear regret on all three metrics. Thus, we consider an augmented setting wherein the operator has access to hints/contexts that reflect the variation in the cost functions and propose an algorithm with sublinear regret in this augmented setting. Finally, we present numerical experiments that validate our results and discuss various model extensions.

In this work, we investigate the potential of geometric Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn a meaningful latent representation that captures the progression of BE. We show that hyperspherical VAE (S-VAE) and Kendall Shape VAE show improved classification accuracy, reconstruction loss, and generative capacity. Additionally, we present a novel autoencoder architecture that can generate qualitative images without the need for a variational framework while retaining the benefits of an autoencoder, such as improved stability and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Network pruning is a commonly used measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks. However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms. Extensive experiments are performed which demonstrate that our theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experiments.

arXiv:2311.13548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m<n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests.

Abstract: Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.

Abstract: In this paper, we study zeroth-order algorithms for nonconvex minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings, which have attracted wide attention in machine learning, signal processing and many other fields in recent years, e.g., adversarial attacks in resource allocation problems and network flow problems etc. We propose two single-loop algorithms, namely the zeroth-order primal-dual alternating projected gradient (ZO-PDAPG) algorithm and the zeroth-order regularized momentum primal-dual projected gradient algorithm (ZO-RMPDPG), for solving deterministic and stochastic nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints. The iteration complexity of the two proposed algorithms to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point are proved to be $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-2})$ (resp. $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon ^{-4})$) for solving nonconvex-strongly concave (resp. nonconvex-concave) minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under deterministic settings and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-3})$ (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon ^{-6.5})$) under stochastic settings respectively. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first two zeroth-order algorithms with iterative complexity guarantees for solving nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems with coupled linear constraints under the deterministic and stochastic settings.

Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to aid with high-stakes decision making. Yet, their predictive ability frequently exhibits systematic variation across population subgroups. To assess the trade-off between fairness and accuracy using finite data, we propose a debiased machine learning estimator for the fairness-accuracy frontier introduced by Liang, Lu, Mu, and Okumura (2024). We derive its asymptotic distribution and propose inference methods to test key hypotheses in the fairness literature, such as (i) whether excluding group identity from use in training the algorithm is optimal and (ii) whether there are less discriminatory alternatives to a given algorithm. In addition, we construct an estimator for the distance between a given algorithm and the fairest point on the frontier, and characterize its asymptotic distribution. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of our inference methods. We apply our framework to re-evaluate algorithms used in hospital care management and show that our approach yields alternative algorithms that lie on the fairness-accuracy frontier, offering improvements along both dimensions.

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.

Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.

Abstract: With the next generation of interferometric telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the need for highly computationally efficient reconstruction techniques is particularly acute. The challenge in designing learned, data-driven reconstruction techniques for radio interferometry is that they need to be agnostic to the varying visibility coverages of the telescope, since these are different for each observation. Because of this, learned post-processing or learned unrolled iterative reconstruction methods must typically be retrained for each specific observation, amounting to a large computational overhead. In this work we develop learned post-processing and unrolled iterative methods for varying visibility coverages, proposing training strategies to make these methods agnostic to variations in visibility coverage with minimal to no fine-tuning. Learned post-processing techniques are heavily dependent on the prior information encoded in training data and generalise poorly to other visibility coverages. In contrast, unrolled iterative methods, which include the telescope measurement operator inside the network, achieve good reconstruction quality and computation time, generalising well to other coverages and require little to no fine-tuning. Furthermore, they generalise well to more realistic radio observations and are able to reconstruct images with with a larger dynamic range than the training set.

<title>Complexity of Injectivity and Verification of ReLU Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activation play a key role in modern machine learning. Understanding the functions represented by ReLU networks is a major topic in current research as this enables a better interpretability of learning processes. Injectivity of a function computed by a ReLU network, that is, the question if different inputs to the network always lead to different outputs, plays a crucial role whenever invertibility of the function is required, such as, e.g., for inverse problems or generative models. The exact computational complexity of deciding injectivity was recently posed as an open problem (Puthawala et al. [JMLR 2022]). We answer this question by proving coNP-completeness. On the positive side, we show that the problem for a single ReLU-layer is still tractable for small input dimension; more precisely, we present a parameterized algorithm which yields fixed-parameter tractability with respect to the input dimension. In addition, we study the network verification problem which is to verify that certain inputs only yield specific outputs. This is of great importance since neural networks are increasingly used in safety-critical systems. We prove that network verification is coNP-hard for a general class of input domains. Our results also exclude constant-factor polynomial-time approximations for the maximum of a function computed by a ReLU network. In this context, we also characterize surjectivity of functions computed by ReLU networks with one-dimensional output which turns out to be the complement of a basic network verification task. We reveal interesting connections to computational convexity by formulating the surjectivity problem as a zonotope containment problem

Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.

Abstract: Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly widespread among software developers. However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using relatively small and efficient LLMs with 160M parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two open transformer-based models, the generative GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO, on open-source Python files, and empirically compare them, confirming the benefits of embedding-based retrieval. Furthermore, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which retrieves code snippets using the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context RAG on larger models and determine that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. Experimental results indicate that In-context RAG improves the code completion baseline by over 26%, while RETRO improves over the similarly sized GPT-2 baseline by 12%. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.

Abstract: Is there a way to design powerful AI systems based on machine learning methods that would satisfy probabilistic safety guarantees? With the long-term goal of obtaining a probabilistic guarantee that would apply in every context, we consider estimating a context-dependent bound on the probability of violating a given safety specification. Such a risk evaluation would need to be performed at run-time to provide a guardrail against dangerous actions of an AI. Noting that different plausible hypotheses about the world could produce very different outcomes, and because we do not know which one is right, we derive bounds on the safety violation probability predicted under the true but unknown hypothesis. Such bounds could be used to reject potentially dangerous actions. Our main results involve searching for cautious but plausible hypotheses, obtained by a maximization that involves Bayesian posteriors over hypotheses. We consider two forms of this result, in the i.i.d. case and in the non-i.i.d. case, and conclude with open problems towards turning such theoretical results into practical AI guardrails.

<title>AUnified Framework for Next-Gen Urban Forecasting via LLM-driven Dependency Retrieval and GeoTransformer</title>

Abstract: Urban forecasting has increasingly benefited from high-dimensional spatial data through two primary approaches: graph-based methods that rely on predefined spatial structures, and region-based methods that focus on learning expressive urban representations. Although these methods have laid a strong foundation, they either rely heavily on structured spatial data, struggle to adapt to task-specific dependencies, or fail to integrate holistic urban context. Moreover, no existing framework systematically integrates these two paradigms and overcomes their respective limitations. To address this gap, we propose a novel, unified framework for high-dimensional urban forecasting, composed of three key components: (1) the Urban Region Representation Module that organizes latent embeddings and semantic descriptions for each region, (2) the Task-aware Dependency Retrieval module that selects relevant context regions based on natural language prompts, and (3) the Prediction Module, exemplified by our proposed GeoTransformer architecture, which adopts a novel geospatial attention mechanism to incorporate spatial proximity and information entropy as priors. Our framework is modular, supports diverse representation methods and forecasting models, and can operate even with minimal input. Quantitative experiments and qualitative analysis across six urban forecasting tasks demonstrate strong task generalization and validate the framework's effectiveness.

<title>Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of spiking neural networks (SNNs), known for their low-power binary spikes, to bearing fault diagnosis, bridging the gap between high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industrial scenarios. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT, JNU, Bearing, and Gearbox benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption, and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen datasets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan's gold standard sampler, where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Framing the investigation of diverse cancers as a machine learning problem has recently shown significant potential in multi-omics analysis and cancer research. Empowering these successful machine learning models are the high-quality training datasets with sufficient data volume and adequate preprocessing. However, while there exist several public data portals, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multi-omics initiative or open-bases such as the LinkedOmics, these databases are not off-the-shelf for existing machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce MLOmics, an open cancer multi-omics database aiming at serving better the development and evaluation of bioinformatics and machine learning models. MLOmics contains 8,314 patient samples covering all 32 cancer types with four omics types, stratified features, and extensive baselines. Complementary support for downstream analysis and bio-knowledge linking are also included to support interdisciplinary analysis.

Abstract: Non-stationary multi-armed bandits (NS-MABs) model sequential decision-making problems in which the expected rewards of a set of actions, a.k.a.~arms, evolve over time. In this paper, we fill a gap in the literature by providing a novel analysis of Thompson sampling-inspired (TS) algorithms for NS-MABs that both corrects and generalizes existing work. Specifically, we study the cumulative frequentist regret of two algorithms based on sliding-window TS approaches with different priors, namely $\textit{Beta-SWTS}$ and $\textit{$\gamma$-SWGTS}$. We derive a unifying regret upper bound for these algorithms that applies to any arbitrary NS-MAB (with either Bernoulli or subgaussian rewards). Our result introduces new indices that capture the inherent sources of complexity in the learning problem. Then, we specialize our general result to two of the most common NS-MAB settings: the $\textit{abruptly changing}$ and the $\textit{smoothly changing}$ environments, showing that it matches state-of-the-art results. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the analyzed algorithms in simulated environments and compare them with state-of-the-art approaches for NS-MABs.

Abstract: Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective in reducing the memory and computational requirements for inference. In this study, we focus on a straightforward question: When aiming for a target accuracy or perplexity with low-precision quantization, how much high-precision computation needs to be preserved and how fine-grained this quantization would need to be as we scale LLMs to larger sizes? We first introduce two critical metrics named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size ($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to low-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the latter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor, akin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments across different model and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling law on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for varying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter scaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently, larger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus supporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference. Regarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that used in Blackwell, is not essential for large models. Employing a small $Q_b$ can instead unnecessarily complicate the design of the hardware circuit.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense language models into sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models is an efficient approach to increase the model capacity of already trained models. However, optimal techniques for upcycling at scale remain unclear. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of upcycling methods and hyperparameters for billion-parameter scale language models. We propose a novel "virtual group" initialization scheme and weight scaling approach to enable upcycling into fine-grained MoE architectures. Through ablations, we find that upcycling outperforms continued dense model training. In addition, we show that softmax-then-topK expert routing improves over topK-then-softmax approach and higher granularity MoEs can help improve accuracy. Finally, we upcycled Nemotron-4 15B on 1T tokens and compared it to a continuously trained version of the same model on the same 1T tokens: the continuous trained model achieved 65.3% MMLU, whereas the upcycled model achieved 67.6%. Our results offer insights and best practices to effectively leverage upcycling for building MoE language models. Code is available.

Abstract: Deep learning and advancements in contactless sensors have significantly enhanced our ability to understand complex human activities in healthcare settings. In particular, deep learning models utilizing computer vision have been developed to enable detailed analysis of human gesture recognition, especially repetitive gestures which are commonly observed behaviors in children with autism. This research work aims to identify repetitive behaviors indicative of autism by analyzing videos captured in natural settings as children engage in daily activities. The focus is on accurately categorizing real-time repetitive gestures such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping. To this end, we utilize the publicly accessible Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) to classify these stereotypical movements. A key component of the proposed methodology is the use of \textbf{VideoMAE}, a model designed to improve both spatial and temporal analysis of video data through a masking and reconstruction mechanism. This model significantly outperformed traditional methods, achieving an accuracy of 97.7\%, a 14.7\% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at: https://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining high-performance policies. However, the safety of these policies has been a long-standing issue. One promising paradigm to guarantee safety is a shield, which shields a policy from making unsafe actions. However, computing a shield scales exponentially in the number of state variables. This is a particular concern in multi-agent systems with many agents. In this work, we propose a novel approach for multi-agent shielding. We address scalability by computing individual shields for each agent. The challenge is that typical safety specifications are global properties, but the shields of individual agents only ensure local properties. Our key to overcome this challenge is to apply assume-guarantee reasoning. Specifically, we present a sound proof rule that decomposes a (global, complex) safety specification into (local, simple) obligations for the shields of the individual agents. Moreover, we show that applying the shields during reinforcement learning significantly improves the quality of the policies obtained for a given training budget. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our multi-agent shielding framework in two case studies, reducing the computation time from hours to seconds and achieving fast learning convergence.

Abstract: In this work, we upgrade the multi-head attention mechanism, the core of the Transformer model, to improve efficiency while maintaining or surpassing the previous accuracy level. We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in the summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold equal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new architecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second, MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking extra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs demonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head attention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH models. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14 benchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the attention heads. We believe the proposed MoH is a promising alternative to multi-head attention and provides a strong foundation for developing advanced and efficient attention-based models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress on image-to-video (I2V) generation, while their noise-to-data generation process is inherently mismatched with this task, which may lead to suboptimal synthesis quality. In this work, we present FrameBridge. By modeling the frame-to-frames generation process with a bridge model based data-to-data generative process, we are able to fully exploit the information contained in the given image and improve the consistency between the generation process and I2V task. Moreover, we propose two novel techniques toward the two popular settings of training I2V models, respectively. Firstly, we propose SNR-Aligned Fine-tuning (SAF), making the first attempt to fine-tune a diffusion model to a bridge model and, therefore, allowing us to utilize the pre-trained diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models. Secondly, we propose neural prior, further improving the synthesis quality of FrameBridge when training from scratch. Experiments conducted on WebVid-2M and UCF-101 demonstrate the superior quality of FrameBridge in comparison with the diffusion counterpart (zero-shot FVD 95 vs. 192 on MSR-VTT and non-zero-shot FVD 122 vs. 171 on UCF-101), and the advantages of our proposed SAF and neural prior for bridge-based I2V models.

arXiv:2411.03932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows our analysis framework to derive a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our techniques advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms.

<title>Counterfactual Uncertainty Quantification of Factual Estimand of Efficacy from Before-and-After Treatment Repeated Measures Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09635</link>

Abstract: This article quantifies the uncertainty reduction achievable for \textit{counterfactual} estimand, and cautions against potential bias when the estimand uses Digital Twins. Posed by Neyman (1923a) who showed unbiased \textit{point estimation} from designed \textit{factual} experiments is possible, \textit{counterfactual} uncertainty quantification (CUQ) remained an open challenge for about one hundred years. The $Rx: C$ \textit{counterfactual} efficacy we focus on is the ideal estimand for comparing treatment $Rx$ with control $C$, the expected outcome differential if each patient received \textit{both} $Rx$ and $C$. Enabled by our new statistical modeling principle called ETZ, we show CUQ is achievable in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with \textit{Before-and-After} Repeated Measures, common in many therapeutic areas. The CUQ we are able to achieve typically has lower variability than factual UQ.
  We caution against using predictors with measurement error, which violates regression assumptions and can cause \textit{attenuation} bias in estimating treatment effects. For traditional medicine and population-averaged targeted therapy, counterfactual point estimation remains unbiased. However, in both Real Human and Digital Twin approaches, estimating effects in \emph{subgroups} may suffer attenuation bias.

arXiv:2411.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for developing efficient and interpretable climate emulators (CEs) for economic models of climate change. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we propose a general framework for constructing carbon-cycle emulators (CCEs) for macroeconomic models. The framework is implemented as a generalized linear multi-reservoir (box) model that conserves key physical quantities and can be customized for specific applications. We consider three versions of the CCE, which we evaluate within a simple representative agent economic model: (i) a three-box setting comparable to DICE-2016, (ii) a four-box extension, and (iii) a four-box version that explicitly captures land-use change. While the three-box model reproduces benchmark results well and the fourth reservoir adds little, incorporating the impact of land-use change on the carbon storage capacity of the terrestrial biosphere substantially alters atmospheric carbon stocks, temperature trajectories, and the optimal mitigation path. Second, we investigate pattern-scaling techniques that transform global-mean temperature projections from CEs into spatially heterogeneous warming fields. We show how regional baseline climates, non-uniform warming, and the associated uncertainties propagate into economic damages.

<title>Gradient Norm Regularization Second-Order Algorithms for Solving Nonconvex-Strongly Concave Minimax Problems</title>

arXiv:2411.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, which have attracted much attention in recent years in many fields, especially in machine learning.We propose a gradient norm regularized trust-region (GRTR) algorithm to solve nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, where the objective function of the trust-region subproblem in each iteration uses a regularized version of the Hessian matrix, and the regularization coefficient and the radius of the ball constraint are proportional to the square root of the gradient norm. The iteration complexity of the proposed GRTR algorithm to obtain an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point is proved to be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$, where $\mu$ is the strong concave coefficient, $\ell$ and $\rho$ are the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and Jacobian matrix respectively, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems. We further propose a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a gradient norm regularization coefficient and use the negative curvature direction to correct the iteration direction (LMNegCur), which does not need to solve the trust-region subproblem at each iteration. We also prove that the LMNegCur algorithm achieves an $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary point within $\tilde{O}(\ell^{1.5}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-1.5}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ number of iterations.The inexact variants of both algorithms can still obtain $O(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon})$-second-order stationary points with high probability, but only require $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2.25}\rho^{0.25}\mu^{-1.75}\epsilon^{-1.75})$ Hessian-vector products and $\tilde{O}(\ell^{2}\rho^{0.5}\mu^{-2}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ gradient ascent steps.

<title>Immune: Improving Safety Against Jailbreaks in Multi-modal LLMs via Inference-Time Alignment</title>

arXiv:2411.18688v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.

Abstract: In human society, the conflict between self-interest and collective well-being often obstructs efforts to achieve shared welfare. Related concepts like the Tragedy of the Commons and Social Dilemmas frequently manifest in our daily lives. As artificial agents increasingly serve as autonomous proxies for humans, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to address this issue - learning policies to maximise collective returns even when individual agents' interests conflict with the collective one. Unlike traditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values, and policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn collectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents exchange action suggestions. Our method reveals less private information compared to sharing rewards, values, or policies, while enabling effective cooperation without the need to design intrinsic rewards. Our algorithm is supported by our theoretical analysis that establishes a bound on the discrepancy between collective and individual objectives, demonstrating how sharing suggestions can align agents' behaviours with the collective objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs competitively with baselines that rely on value or policy sharing or intrinsic rewards.

<title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>

arXiv:2412.16619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.

<title>SWAG: Long-term Surgical Workflow Prediction with Generative-based Anticipation</title>

arXiv:2412.18849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While existing approaches excel at recognising current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight and intraoperative guidance into future procedural steps. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term and single events, neglecting the dense, repetitive, and long sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these needs and limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a framework that combines phase recognition and anticipation using a generative approach. This paper investigates two distinct decoding methods - single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR) - to generate sequences of future surgical phases at minute intervals over long horizons. We propose a novel embedding approach using class transition probabilities to enhance the accuracy of phase anticipation. Additionally, we propose a generative framework using remaining time regression to classification (R2C). SWAG was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21. Our single-pass model with class transition probability embeddings (SP*) achieves 32.1% and 41.3% F1 scores over 20 and 30 minutes on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21, respectively. Moreover, our approach competes with existing methods on phase remaining time regression, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons. SWAG demonstrates versatility across generative decoding frame works and classification and regression tasks to create temporal continuity between surgical workflow recognition and anticipation. Our method provides steps towards intraoperative surgical workflow generation for anticipation. Project: https://maxboels.com/research/swag.

<title>Unifying Specialized Visual Encoders for Video Language Models</title>

Abstract: The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.

<title>PPO-Based Vehicle Control for Ramp Merging Scheme Assisted by Enhanced C-V2X</title>

arXiv:2501.12656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-ramp merging presents a critical challenge in autonomous driving, as vehicles from merging lanes need to dynamically adjust their positions and speeds while monitoring traffic on the main road to prevent collisions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.

arXiv:2501.15659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial odometry (IO) using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) offers a lightweight and cost-effective solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications, yet existing learning-based IO models often fail to generalize to UAVs due to the highly dynamic and non-linear-flight patterns that differ from pedestrian motion. In this work, we identify that the conventional practice of transforming raw IMU data to global coordinates undermines the observability of critical kinematic information in UAVs. By preserving the body-frame representation, our method achieves substantial performance improvements, with a 66.7% average increase in accuracy across three datasets. Furthermore, explicitly encoding attitude information into the motion network results in an additional 23.8% improvement over prior results. Combined with a data-driven IMU correction model (AirIMU) and an uncertainty-aware Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), our approach ensures robust state estimation under aggressive UAV maneuvers without relying on external sensors or control inputs. Notably, our method also demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen data not included in the training set, underscoring its potential for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that represents a set $S$ of elements from a larger universe $U$. This efficiency comes with a trade-off, namely, it allows for a small chance of false positives. When you query the Bloom filter about an element x, the filter will respond 'Yes' if $x \in S$. If $x \notin S$, it may still respond 'Yes' with probability at most $\varepsilon$. We investigate the adversarial robustness and privacy of Bloom filters, addressing open problems across three prominent frameworks: the game-based model of Naor-Oved-Yogev (NOY), the simulator-based model of Filic et. al., and learning-augmented variants. We prove the first formal connection between the Filic and NOY models, showing that Filic correctness implies AB-test resilience. We resolve a longstanding open question by proving that PRF-backed Bloom filters fail the NOY model's stronger BP-test. Finally, we introduce the first private Bloom filters with differential privacy guarantees, including constructions applicable to learned Bloom filters. Our taxonomy organizes the space of robustness and privacy guarantees, clarifying relationships between models and constructions.

arXiv:2502.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The field of algorithms with predictions incorporates machine learning advice in the design of online algorithms to improve real-world performance. A central consideration is the extent to which predictions can be trusted -- while existing approaches often require users to specify an aggregate trust level, modern machine learning models can provide estimates of prediction-level uncertainty. In this paper, we propose calibration as a principled and practical tool to bridge this gap, demonstrating the benefits of calibrated advice through two case studies: the ski rental and online job scheduling problems. For ski rental, we design an algorithm that achieves near-optimal prediction-dependent performance and prove that, in high-variance settings, calibrated advice offers more effective guidance than alternative methods for uncertainty quantification. For job scheduling, we demonstrate that using a calibrated predictor leads to significant performance improvements over existing methods. Evaluations on real-world data validate our theoretical findings, highlighting the practical impact of calibration for algorithms with predictions.

Abstract: We revisit Blackwell's celebrated approachability problem which considers a repeated vector-valued game between a player and an adversary. Motivated by settings in which the action set of the player or adversary (or both) is difficult to optimize over, for instance when it corresponds to the set of all possible solutions to some NP-Hard optimization problem, we ask what can the player guarantee \textit{efficiently}, when only having access to these sets via approximation algorithms with ratios $\alpha_{\mX} \geq 1$ and $ 1 \geq \alpha_{\mY} > 0$, respectively. Assuming the player has monotone preferences, in the sense that he does not prefer a vector-valued loss $\ell_1$ over $\ell_2$ if $\ell_2 \leq \ell_1$, we establish that given a Blackwell instance with an approachable target set $S$, the downward closure of the appropriately-scaled set $\alpha_{\mX}\alpha_{\mY}^{-1}S$ is \textit{efficiently} approachable with optimal rate. In case only the player's or adversary's set is equipped with an approximation algorithm, we give simpler and more efficient algorithms.

<title>Robust Conformal Outlier Detection under Contaminated Reference Data</title>

arXiv:2502.04807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a flexible framework for calibrating machine learning predictions, providing distribution-free statistical guarantees. In outlier detection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to control the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier reference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves access to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers. This paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of conformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings, calibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control, shedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This conservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that leverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to selectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are suspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this ``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the risk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical analysis. Experiments on real datasets validate the conservative behavior of conformal methods under contamination and show that the proposed data-cleaning strategy improves power without sacrificing validity.

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of offline assortment optimization under the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, where sellers must determine the optimal subset of the products to offer based solely on historical customer choice data. While most existing approaches to learning-based assortment optimization focus on the online learning of the optimal assortment through repeated interactions with customers, such exploration can be costly or even impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we consider the offline learning paradigm and investigate the minimal data requirements for efficient offline assortment optimization. To this end, we introduce Pessimistic Rank-Breaking (PRB), an algorithm that combines rank-breaking with pessimistic estimation. We prove that PRB is nearly minimax optimal by establishing the tight suboptimality upper bound and a nearly matching lower bound. This further shows that "optimal item coverage" - where each item in the optimal assortment appears sufficiently often in the historical data - is both sufficient and necessary for efficient offline learning. This significantly relaxes the previous requirement of observing the complete optimal assortment in the data. Our results provide fundamental insights into the data requirements for offline assortment optimization under the MNL model.

arXiv:2502.09604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SelfCite, a novel self-supervised approach that aligns LLMs to generate high-quality, fine-grained, sentence-level citations for the statements in their generated responses. Instead of only relying on costly and labor-intensive annotations, SelfCite leverages a reward signal provided by the LLM itself through context ablation: If a citation is necessary, removing the cited text from the context should prevent the same response; if sufficient, retaining the cited text alone should preserve the same response. This reward can guide the inference-time best-of-N sampling strategy to improve citation quality significantly, as well as be used in preference optimization to directly fine-tune the models for generating better citations. The effectiveness of SelfCite is demonstrated by increasing citation F1 up to 5.3 points on the LongBench-Cite benchmark across five long-form question answering tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee & Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \sqrt{d} \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee & Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and applying Ville's inequality to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.

Abstract: Estimating the causal effects of an intervention on outcomes is crucial to policy and decision-making. But often, information about outcomes can be missing or subject to non-standard measurement error. It may be possible to reveal ground-truth outcome information at a cost, for example via data annotation or follow-up; but budget constraints entail that only a fraction of the dataset can be labeled. In this setting, we optimize which data points should be sampled for outcome information and, therefore, efficient average treatment effect estimation with missing data. We do so by allocating data annotation in batches. We extend to settings where outcomes may be recorded in unstructured data that can be annotated at a cost, such as text or images, for example, in healthcare or social services. Our motivating application is a collaboration with a street outreach provider with millions of case notes, where it is possible to expertly label some, but not all, ground-truth outcomes. We demonstrate how expert labels and noisy imputed labels can be combined efficiently and responsibly into a doubly robust causal estimator. We run experiments on simulated data and two real-world datasets, including one on street outreach interventions in homelessness services, to show the versatility of our proposed method.

<title>Collaboration Between the City and Machine Learning Community is Crucial to Efficient Autonomous Vehicles Routing</title>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs), possibly using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for simultaneous route optimization, may destabilize traffic networks, with human drivers potentially experiencing longer travel times. We study this interaction by simulating human drivers and AVs. Our experiments with standard MARL algorithms reveal that, both in simplified and complex networks, policies often fail to converge to an optimal solution or require long training periods. This problem is amplified by the fact that we cannot rely entirely on simulated training, as there are no accurate models of human routing behavior. At the same time, real-world training in cities risks destabilizing urban traffic systems, increasing externalities, such as $CO_2$ emissions, and introducing non-stationarity as human drivers will adapt unpredictably to AV behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that city authorities must collaborate with the ML community to monitor and critically evaluate the routing algorithms proposed by car companies toward fair and system-efficient routing algorithms and regulatory standards.

<title>ProMedTS: A Self-Supervised, Prompt-Guided Multimodal Approach for Integrating Medical Text and Time Series</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Motivated by the prevalence of prediction problems in the economy, we study markets in which firms sell models to a consumer to help improve their prediction. Firms decide whether to enter, choose models to train on their data, and set prices. The consumer can purchase multiple models and use a weighted average of the models bought. Market outcomes can be expressed in terms of the \emph{bias-variance decompositions} of the models that firms sell. We give conditions when symmetric firms will choose different modeling techniques, e.g., each using only a subset of available covariates. We also show firms can choose inefficiently biased models or inefficiently costly models to deter entry by competitors.

<div> RareGraph-Synth, knowledge-guided framework, synthetic electronic-health-record trajectories, ultra-rare diseases, privacy-preserving.  
Summary: RareGraph-Synth proposes a novel framework for generating synthetic electronic health records for ultra-rare diseases. By leveraging various public resources and an 8-million-edge knowledge graph, the model produces realistic yet privacy-preserving EHR trajectories. Meta-path scores from the knowledge graph guide the generation process, leading to biologically plausible outcomes while ensuring model stability. Compared to baseline models and GAN counterparts, RareGraph-Synth achieves significantly lower Maximum Mean Discrepancy without compromising predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation demonstrates strong resistance to re-identification, making it suitable for data sharing in rare-disease research. Integrating biomedical knowledge graphs into diffusion noise schedules enhances fidelity and privacy, providing a safe approach for generating synthetic data.

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases. RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.

<div> Keywords: Multi-objective optimization, Large language models, Evolutionary algorithms, Hybrid models, Drug design

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach, Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), to tackle multi-objective discrete optimization problems in areas such as molecular design. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often struggle with such complex problems, leading to suboptimal solutions. By combining a frozen closed-source large language model (LLM) with a lightweight trainable model, MCCE leverages the strengths of both models. The closed-source LLM contributes broad knowledge and reasoning ability, while the trainable model is continually refined through reinforcement learning, enhancing their combined exploration capabilities. The system maintains a memory of past search processes to guide future iterations. Experimental results on drug design benchmarks demonstrate that MCCE outperforms baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of Pareto front quality. This innovative approach paves the way for continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, blending knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning.

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design, pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima, while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However, closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration. Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers. However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art (SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse application domains.

Summary:
Our goal is to develop a method for automated knot recognition using a combination of modern machine learning techniques and traditional algorithms. We propose a strategy that involves using convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition, along with computing quantum invariants like the Jones polynomial. By implementing simple baseline models, we show that lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can successfully predict crossing numbers from images, indicating the potential for extracting structural details. The ultimate objective is to integrate perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram codes, allowing for invariant computation and robust knot classification. This two-stage approach emphasizes the synergy between machine learning for handling visual data and invariants for ensuring accurate topological distinctions. <div>

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

The paper introduces Trajectory Transformer, a model that utilizes a transformer backbone for generating high-quality trajectories in spatiotemporal data mining. Unlike existing methods that rely on convolution-based architectures, Trajectory Transformer employs transformer architecture for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. The model explores two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding, and longitude-latitude embedding, to enhance performance at different scales. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Trajectory Transformer outperforms previous approaches by improving generation quality and preserving fine-grained street-level details, addressing deviation issues.

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper, we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

Summary:
BlockGPT is introduced as a generative autoregressive transformer model using batched tokenization to predict precipitation maps for short-term forecasting. It factorizes space-time using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames, specifically designed for precipitation nowcasting. Evaluation on KNMI and SEVIR datasets shows that BlockGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, event localization, and inference speed, with up to 31x faster performance. This model addresses the limitations of current methods by combining efficient computation with accurate predictions for real-time applications. <div>

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT, a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block) method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step. Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet) models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

<div> Efficient, SDAR, Autoregressive, Diffusion, Parallel Inference

Summary: 
SDAR introduces a novel paradigm that combines the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. By converting a well-trained autoregressive model into a blockwise diffusion model through adaptation, SDAR maintains the computational efficiency of autoregressive models while enabling parallel generation during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SDAR scales efficiently across different architectures, showing improved performance on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench. Additionally, SDAR exhibits enhanced reasoning and adaptability, surpassing autoregressive models and achieving further improvements through test-time scaling methods. Overall, SDAR offers a practical solution that leverages the strengths of both autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Foundation models, AI development, dynamic environments, self-adapting AI models, decentralized architecture

Summary:
Foundation models in AI have advanced rapidly, prompting questions about their potential to surpass human strategies in real-world domains. However, many areas such as intensive care medicine still show modest gains in utilizing AI for dynamic disease diagnosis and treatment. Adapting complex systems to dynamic environments requires self-adaptive modeling that optimizes outcomes while avoiding side effects. The curse of dimensionality poses a significant challenge to efficient self-adaptation, with monolithic foundation models facing conceptual limits. A proposed alternative is a decentralized architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs), where specialized agents cover subsets of system functions. Swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable self-adaptive SANs to outperform monolithic models in dynamic environments, albeit with reduced reproducibility in detail. It is crucial for AI to demonstrate clear superiority in these settings before taking on broader decision-making roles. 

Summary: <br><br> <div>
arXiv:2510.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains. The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments. Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced reproducibility in detail.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called PIKAN for modeling air-to-ground (A2G) channels for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). PIKAN combines physical principles with deep learning to create accurate yet interpretable channel models. Unlike existing methods, PIKAN introduces physical information as flexible biases, allowing for a more adaptable training process. Experimental results using UAV A2G measurement data demonstrate that PIKAN achieves similar accuracy to deep learning models while providing symbolic and explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Notably, PIKAN requires only 232 parameters, significantly lighter than traditional multilayer perceptron baselines. This makes PIKAN an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modeling in future wireless networks beyond 5G and 6G. <div>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and 6G networks.

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

Summary: <br>
The paper introduces the Relational Transformer (RT) architecture designed to handle diverse relational data without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. RT tokenizes cells with metadata, is pretrained via masked token prediction, and uses Relational Attention for columns, rows, and key links. Pretrained on various relational databases, RT achieves strong zero-shot performance, with 94% average AUROC on binary classification tasks. This outperforms a large language model and can be fine-tuned for state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency. The experiments demonstrate that RT leverages task-table context, relational attention patterns, and schema semantics for effective zero-shot transfer learning. RT offers a practical approach towards foundation models for relational data. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer (RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and (iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns, rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84% for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics. Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational data.

Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS) is proposed as a superior Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm compared to GRAVE, especially in scenarios where deep reinforcement learning is not feasible or computational power is limited. MCPS includes statistics from all playouts containing moves on the path to a node in exploration, leading to improved performance in a variety of games. Testing across board games, wargames, investment games, video games, and multiplayer games demonstrates MCPS's superior results in two-player games and equivalent performance in multiplayer games. Abstract codes for moves improve permutation statistics and the AMAF statistics for both MCPS and GRAVE. Mathematical formulas, free from bias hyperparameters, are derived for weighting statistics sources in MCPS, making it less sensitive to hyperparameters than GRAVE._icall<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE. Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

Summary:  
This study introduces a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, building on previous work focused on binary prediction. The research explores methods for extending calibration measures from binary to multi-class prediction, distinguishing between those that maintain truthfulness and those that do not. The proposed calibration measure demonstrates superior robustness, consistently preserving the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors across different hyperparameter choices. This addresses the non-robustness issue observed in previous works related to binned Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The findings highlight the significance of adopting truthful calibration measures for assessing prediction accuracy and the importance of robustness in evaluating predictor performance in multi-class scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness: it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors, regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in prior work.

<div> boundary-driven asymmetry, hyperbolic geometry, model sensitivity, defense methods, attack success

Summary:
Non-Euclidean foundation models utilize curved spaces such as hyperbolic geometry, resulting in a boundary-driven asymmetry that can be exploited by backdoor triggers. Small input changes near the boundary lead to disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation space, making them difficult to detect using standard methods. Defenses that pull points inward along the radius can suppress such triggers, but at the cost of sacrificing model sensitivity in that direction. A geometry-adaptive trigger is proposed to address this vulnerability, with empirical evaluations showing increased attack success towards the boundary and weakened conventional detectors. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the implications of curved spaces on model behavior and provide guidance for designing effective defenses. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures. Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of defenses.

<div> supervised classification, label noise, deep learning models, hidden representations, information imbalance
Summary:
The study explores the impact of label noise on the performance and hidden representations of deep learning models in supervised classification tasks. Analyzing the information content of hidden representations using the Information Imbalance metric, the researchers found that the information content follows a double descent pattern relative to the number of network parameters. In the underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels were more informative than those with clean labels, while in the overparameterized regime, the representations were equally informative. Results indicated that overparameterized networks were robust to label noise, with a decrease in information imbalance between layers as cross-entropy loss increased. Additionally, training on random labels resulted in worse performance compared to random features, indicating that networks adapt and encode label information even when trained on random labels.
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters, akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels information.

Summary:<br>
The study examines the effectiveness of using a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models instead of a single large model. By employing ensembling or model selection techniques on these portfolios, the researchers achieve competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. They find that specialized models outperform generalists consistently, and that post-training a base model can effectively create diverse specialists. Furthermore, evidence suggests that ensembling and model selection are more computationally efficient than test-time fine-tuning. <div>

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters. We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists, and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

Summary: 
This study focuses on improving our understanding of sequential learning in a multi-trajectory setting, where data consists of independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. The researchers introduce a method using the Hellinger localization framework for maximum likelihood estimation to achieve instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget. By controlling the squared Hellinger distance and localizing as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information, the study broadens the scope of instance-optimal rates in various scenarios including a mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. The results show significant improvements over existing standard reductions in terms of accuracy and efficiency. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete, particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates; for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over standard reductions.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Bayesian optimization framework designed for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty, focusing on optimizing scale- or precision-type parameters in stochastic models. By utilizing a statistical surrogate for the random variable, the method allows for analytical evaluation of the expectation operator. Additionally, the study derives a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the random acquisition function, which leads to a significant reduction in computational cost per iteration compared to traditional Monte Carlo-based optimization schemes.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points, resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in computational engineering.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive. Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs. These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Summary:
The study focuses on examining the benchmarks used to assess transferability estimation metrics for pre-trained models. It highlights the flaws in existing benchmark setups, showing that unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies lead to inflated metric performance. The research demonstrates that current evaluation protocols do not accurately represent real-world model selection complexities, with simple heuristics sometimes outperforming sophisticated methods. Recommendations are provided for constructing more realistic benchmarks to guide future research effectively. This work underscores the importance of addressing the disconnect between evaluation protocols and the complexities of model selection for meaningful progress in developing transferability estimation metrics. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide future research in a more meaningful direction.

Summary:
- The study explores the connection between attention sinks and compression valleys in large language models, attributing both phenomena to massive activations in the residual stream.
- Theoretical analysis demonstrates that massive activations lead to representational compression and reduced entropy.
- Experimental results across various models confirm the emergence of compression valleys and attention sinks when extreme activation norms are observed in the middle layers.
- A unified view is proposed, introducing the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow to explain how LLMs organize computation by controlling attention and representational compression.
- The theory suggests that LLMs process tokens through three phases: mixing in early layers, compressed computation in middle layers with limited mixing, and selective refinement in late layers, shedding light on task-dependent representations. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying differences in task-dependent representations.

Summary:
Sequential-EDFL is introduced as a method for improving language model generation stopping, utilizing anytime-valid sequential testing. It tracks information lift using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes, providing formal error control regardless of stopping time. It reduces generation time by 22-28% on benchmarks while maintaining error control with minimal computational overhead. The approach handles unknown centering and distributional drift, supports adaptive resets, and incorporates automated skeletons for improved performance. Combining EDFL with a correctness gate enhances end-task correctness without sacrificing anytime-valid guarantees. However, while EDFL can reduce verification burden by 83%, it does not guarantee factual correctness, with 10.9% of stopped sequences remaining incorrect even with the gate. EDFL should be viewed as a filter to reduce verification workload rather than a standalone solution for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone solution for safety-critical domains.

Summary:<br><br>Algorithmic efficiency techniques like distillation have proven effective in enhancing model quality without adding to serving costs. In this paper, a new method called \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings) is introduced, focusing on extracting more valuable information from a teacher model than just matching outputs. \guide forces the student model to match the teacher in the parameter space, leading to a significant reduction in the teacher-student quality gap. Results show a 25-26% improvement when using large student models trained on a substantial dataset. The technique can also be combined with knowledge distillation for even greater enhancements. Notably, \guide incurs no additional training or inference overhead, making any quality improvements practically cost-free. <div>

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation (\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs. Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show 25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

Summary:<br>
The article presents Medix, a novel framework for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in machine learning systems. Utilizing unlabeled data, Medix identifies potential outliers using the median operation, known for its robustness against noise and outliers. By leveraging these outliers along with labeled in-distribution (InD) data, Medix trains a robust OOD classifier. The framework achieves low error rates as demonstrated by theoretical error bounds. Empirical results show that Medix outperforms existing methods in open-world settings, confirming its effectiveness. The use of unlabeled data is emphasized in enhancing OOD detection capabilities, addressing the challenges posed by mixed InD and OOD samples. Overall, Medix offers a promising approach for improving the reliability and robustness of machine learning systems deployed in real-world applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data, showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However, effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency, as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical insights.

<div> leaderboards, generative AI, manipulation, text-to-image, deanonymization

Summary:
Deanonymizing models in text-to-image leaderboards is shown to be easier than previously thought, posing a threat to the integrity of rank manipulation. The study analyzed over 150,000 generated images from various models and prompts, revealing that simple real-time classification techniques in CLIP embedding space can accurately identify the generating model. This identification process can occur without the need for prompt control or historical data. Additionally, a prompt-level separability metric was introduced to pinpoint prompts that facilitate near-perfect deanonymization. These findings underscore the vulnerability of text-to-image leaderboards to manipulation and emphasize the necessity for enhanced defensive measures to protect against such attacks. <div>

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

<div> randomly initialized neural networks, width, hyperparameters, activation function, Gaussian measure
Summary:
Randomly initialized neural networks with large width and certain hyperparameters exhibit nearly independent outputs when their activation function has a zero mean under the Gaussian measure. This phenomenon applies to non-linear functions such as ReLU, GeLU with an additive shift, and tanh, but not to ReLU or GeLU alone. The study suggests that neural networks with zero-mean activation functions could be a potential solution to the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture, which seeks to explore the boundaries of AI interpretability. <div>
arXiv:2510.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture -- a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

<div> finite-state Markov Decision Process, Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning, policy-based learning, linear function approximation, TD-learning

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenges in learning optimal policies in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) by approximating them as finite-state Markov decision processes (MDPs) called Superstate MDPs. The authors provide theoretical guarantees on the relationship between the optimal value functions of the original POMDP and the Superstate MDP. They propose a policy-based learning approach using linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. This approach demonstrates that POMDPs can be solved approximately using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization, treating them as MDPs with finite histories. The approximation error diminishes exponentially with the length of the history, providing insights into the error introduced by applying TD-learning in non-Markovian dynamics. This work provides a novel and promising method for efficiently solving POMDPs. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

<div> incoherence, reinforcement learning, goal-conditioning, autoregressive models, policy

Summary: 
The study delves into the concept of incoherence in reinforcement learning policies resulting from naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models. The focus is on the process of re-training models on their own actions, showing that it reduces incoherence and enhances returns. The research aims to define the trajectory of policies that emerge from this re-training process. By reinterpreting control-as-inference and soft Q learning, a correlation is established with folding the posterior into the reward and reducing the temperature parameter in deterministic scenarios, with implications for the training-inference trade-off. The study also discusses the relationship between incoherence and the effective horizon through soft-conditioning generative models. <div>

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence and the effective horizon.

arXiv:2510.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

Summary:<br>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential for significant impact in supporting clinical trials, particularly in areas such as patient recruitment, endpoint assessment, and treatment response prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards can pose risks, especially in evaluating endpoints directly influencing trial conclusions. A study compared two AI frameworks against human assessment for medical image-based disease evaluation, considering factors like cost, accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. Stress-testing the frameworks with varied bad models confirmed that using AI as a supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most appropriate approach for clinical trials. This method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, maintains the validity of treatment effects, and demonstrates robustness across different model types and populations. These findings highlight the critical role AI can play in enhancing clinical trial processes while ensuring the integrity of trial outcomes. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks, particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages when applied to different populations.

Summary:
The study introduces a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) for estimating Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) metrics directly from sparse Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) data. By integrating two paths - spatial-channel attention and ResNet - DPA-Net reconstructs CGM-like trajectories and predicts AGP metrics accurately. An alignment mechanism reduces bias and overfitting, while an active point selector identifies informative SMBG sampling points reflecting patient behavior. The framework offers a novel supervised machine learning approach for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, bridging the accessibility gap between CGM and SMBG. Experimental results on real-world data show robust accuracy, low errors, and reduced bias, making it a practical decision-support tool in regions lacking CGM accessibility.

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

Summary: The article introduces the Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME) algorithm, which aims to enhance the performance of fine-tuned large language models without needing extra data or further optimization. POME works by applying a muon-style projection to the weight differences between pretrained and fine-tuned models. By using truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), POME equalizes the influence of dominant directions and prunes noise represented by small singular values. As a post-processing step, POME is independent of the training process, compatible with different optimizers and distributed frameworks, and imposes no extra overhead. The algorithm consistently boosts model performance by an average of +2.5% on GSM8K and +1.0% on code generation tasks. It is applicable to a wide range of large models, making it a practical and zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$, the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by +2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from 7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline.

This research introduces an integrated AI and remote-sensor framework for leak detection in underground water pipelines. By deploying a sparse set of remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with the HydroNet model, the system addresses the challenge of leaks and infiltrations in pipelines. HydroNet, a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes in a directed graph, outperforms advanced baselines by utilizing spatio-temporal hydraulic data effectively. The integration of edge-aware message passing with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from limited sensor deployments. This approach shows promise for enhancing the efficiency of leak detection in underground water pipelines and can be extended to various pipeline networks. <br> <div>

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet - a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter, slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6% $\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean $\pm$ std).

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting, while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

This framework is evaluated in the context of data assimilation for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs). By reducing the inference process to a single forward rollout with real-time corrections, the approach outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two PDEs and six observation regimes. This approach eliminates the need for costly adjoint computations or optimizations during inference, offering a more efficient and accurate solution for data assimilation in complex systems. The code and checkpoints for this framework will be made publicly available. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We will release code and checkpoints publicly.

Summary:
A core challenge in scientific machine learning is modeling continuous phenomena discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) aim to address this by allowing inference at arbitrary resolution. This study evaluates MLOs' capability for zero-shot super-resolution, testing if they can handle higher-resolution data than they were trained on. The research explores zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution inference, focusing on extrapolation and interpolation across resolutions. Results show that MLOs struggle with both tasks, exhibiting brittleness and aliasing issues. To overcome these limitations, a new multi-resolution training protocol is proposed. This protocol, which is simple, computationally efficient, and data-driven, successfully addresses aliasing problems and enhances multi-resolution generalization.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization.

Summary:<br>
The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a cutting-edge learning approach for neural networks that utilizes two forward passes instead of the traditional forward and backward passes in backpropagation. However, FF has mainly been used in supervised settings, leaving a gap in domains like RL where learning signals are more natural. This study introduces Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a new value estimation method for local RL. Inspired by FF's goodness function and layer activity statistics, ARQ incorporates action conditioning and temporal difference learning. Remarkably, ARQ outperforms state-of-the-art backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks and even surpasses algorithms trained with backpropagation on most tasks. The approach is simple yet effective, demonstrating superior performance and biological grounding in RL tasks.<br>

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work, inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with backpropagation on most tasks.

Summary:
The study introduces Gaussian Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM) as a new class of differentiable modules for neural networks. Drawing inspiration from Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Gaussian kernel distance properties, GMNM offers a flexible parameterization that enhances non-linearity in various neural architectures. By relaxing probabilistic constraints, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into architectures like MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs, leading to consistent performance improvements compared to standard baselines. The experiments showcase the potential of GMNM in boosting efficiency and accuracy across a wide range of machine learning applications. <div>

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength, these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range of machine learning applications.

Summary:<br>
The study focuses on the approximation properties of transformers, particularly examining the impact of the number of attention heads. A generalized task is introduced to establish theoretical framework, proving its density in the space of continuous functions. Upper and lower bounds on parameter complexity for approximation are derived, showing that transformers with many heads allow efficient approximation. A lower bound is established for transformers with too few heads, indicating parameters must scale as O(1/epsilon^{cT}). In the single-head case, an embedding dimension of O(T) enables complete input memorization using the feed-forward block for approximation. Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world data confirms the practical relevance of the findings. <div>

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for $\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$, for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the practical relevance of our results.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, large language model, XRPO, exploration-exploitation, policy optimization

Summary:
XRPO is a new reinforcement learning framework designed to improve large language model reasoning by balancing exploration and exploitation during training. It introduces a rollout allocator that prioritizes prompts with potential for uncertainty reduction and uses a seeding strategy to address stagnation on challenging prompts. The framework also incorporates a mechanism to amplify low-probability correct responses, enhancing the model's ability to exploit sparse rewards. Experimental results across various math and coding benchmarks show that XRPO outperforms existing methods like GRPO and GSPO, achieving up to a 4% improvement in pass@1 and 6% in cons@32 metrics while accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7 times. Overall, XRPO demonstrates significant advancements in improving model performance and training efficiency in large language model reasoning tasks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16 rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation. To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

Summary: 
- The paper introduces a novel Transformer architecture, TimeFormer, specifically designed for time series data, considering the unique characteristics of temporal information.
- TimeFormer incorporates a self-attention mechanism with modulation terms (MoSA) to capture the unidirectional influence from past to future and decaying influence over time in time series data.

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA), designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other Transformer-based models.

<div> Bandit, Multiplayer, Distributed, Regret, Communication

Summary:
In this study, the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem is examined, where multiple players aim to maximize their cumulative rewards by selecting arms. Collisions, which occur when multiple players choose the same arm, result in no reward and are observed by the involved players. The research focuses on a decentralized scenario without central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and collision feedback. A distributed algorithm with an adaptive communication protocol is proposed, achieving near-optimal group and individual regret with a communication cost of only O(log log T). Experimental results showcase significant performance enhancements over existing baselines, particularly in reducing individual regret compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an extension to a periodic asynchronous setting is discussed, including the lower bound for this problem and an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive, efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

Summary:<br>
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed physical laws into loss functions for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Training PINNs is challenging due to balancing multiple loss terms with conflicting objectives. Existing methods use a "pre-combine" strategy to manipulate gradients before optimization, which may limit performance. This work introduces AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine" training paradigm, assigning independent adaptive optimizers to each loss component and aggregating updates. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that AutoBalance outperforms existing frameworks, reducing solution error significantly. The approach is complementary to other popular PINN methodologies, enhancing their effectiveness on demanding benchmarks. AutoBalance offers a promising solution for improving the training of PINNs and addressing the difficulties in optimizing models with heterogeneous loss landscapes.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine" training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$ norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding benchmarks.

Summary: 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become essential in various applications, with their internal models considered valuable assets. Recent research has focused on extracting these models, similar to extracting a secret key from a block cipher. While early works assumed access to exact output logits, newer approaches focus on the hard-label setting, where only the final classification result is known. However, limitations arise as the attack depth increases, requiring exponential queries for realistic assumptions. To overcome this challenge, a novel attack method called CrossLayer Extraction is proposed. This technique leverages neuron interactions across layers to extract information from deeper layers, reducing query complexity and addressing the constraints of existing model extraction methods. The CrossLayer Extraction approach presents a more efficient and effective means of extracting internal models from ReLU-based DNN architectures. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently, cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024) assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting, where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice, satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction approaches.

Summary:<br>
Generating realistic time series data is crucial for various applications but can be challenging due to irregular sampling and missing values. Traditional methods may not provide optimal results and can be computationally expensive. The ImagenTime model addresses these challenges by transforming time series into image representations, offering strong generative capabilities. However, extending this model to irregular sequences using simple masking can lead to unnatural neighborhoods, affecting the learning process. To overcome this, a new two-step framework is proposed: first, a Time Series Transformer completes irregular sequences to create natural neighborhoods, and second, a vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on completed values. This approach combines the strengths of completion and masking, resulting in robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant improvement in discriminative score and computational cost reduction. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations, making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking, enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$.

Summary: 
In this work, the concept of dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is introduced. These representations encode a state based on its relationships with all other states, measured by temporal distances. This unique representation is invariant to the original state representation and contains sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy while filtering out external noise. A practical goal representation learning method is developed based on this concept, which can be integrated with existing GCRL algorithms. Experimental results on the OGBench task suite demonstrate that dual goal representations consistently enhance the offline goal-reaching performance across a variety of state- and pixel-based tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy, while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks, resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH: attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information, training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting, obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs) must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally, research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm. Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive intervention.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer (TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models, with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW, is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series forecasts, being available for future analysis at https://github.com/SFStefenon/CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW .

<title>Enhancing Bankruptcy Prediction of Banks through Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: An Innovative Approach and Analysis</title>

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy. New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to 2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019. Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of bankruptcy.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

<title>SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to high-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/spherepaircc/SpherePairCC/tree/main}{our repository}.

<title>Vacuum Spiker: A Spiking Neural Network-Based Model for Efficient Anomaly Detection in Time Series</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals, assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models (LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions. We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective, interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely matching manually engineered baselines.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS

<title>Fisher Information, Training and Bias in Fourier Regression Models</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads, thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines. Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes. Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes classical directional convergence results.

<title>High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9 for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach, High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based methods while significantly reducing training costs.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and \emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i) replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility, agility and iterative approach to business processes.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

<title>Federated Unlearning in the Wild: Rethinking Fairness and Data Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the "right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked. Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining, even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity. These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach, Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

<title>Unified Molecule Pre-training with Flexible 2D and 3D Modalities: Single and Paired Modality Integration</title>

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training, aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However, these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically, inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tewiSong/FlexMol.

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences. To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation, accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms. Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical, user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO). Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with 32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires 143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020 baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by 0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to this work is available at: https://github.com/youngaryan/speechbrain-emotion-hpo.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition, thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18 meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single serving cell.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations. These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features. Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g., 0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where $F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling, focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch. Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386 in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level $\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$ capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$, the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of $\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.

<title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search</title>

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making. However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information, without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000 times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured, layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision making under partial observability.

<title>Bridged Clustering for Representation Learning: Semi-Supervised Sparse Bridging</title>

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input $x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL, Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment. Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor. Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

<title>Poisoning Attacks on LLMs Require a Near-constant Number of Poison Samples</title>

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs) by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes, despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate this risk in future models.

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep, real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

<title>Guided by the Experts: Provable Feature Learning Dynamic of Soft-Routed Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1 routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework. We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is ``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons, followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

<title>A Broader View of Thompson Sampling</title>

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation, remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens, Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

<title>Test-Time Graph Search for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised, domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for offline GCRL.

<title>Dynamic Regret Bounds for Online Omniprediction with Long Term Constraints</title>

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions, each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents -- where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge. First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations. Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality, real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories, objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.

Abstract: The Internet of Energy (IoE) integrates IoT-driven digital communication with power grids to enable efficient and sustainable energy systems. Still, its interconnectivity exposes critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyber threats, including adversarial attacks designed to bypass traditional safeguards. Unlike general IoT risks, IoE threats have heightened public safety consequences, demanding resilient solutions. From the networking-level safeguard perspective, we propose a Graph Structure Learning (GSL)-based safeguards framework that jointly optimizes graph topology and node representations to resist adversarial network model manipulation inherently. Through a conceptual overview, architectural discussion, and case study on a security dataset, we demonstrate GSL's superior robustness over representative methods, offering practitioners a viable path to secure IoE networks against evolving attacks. This work highlights the potential of GSL to enhance the resilience and reliability of future IoE networks for practitioners managing critical infrastructure. Lastly, we identify key open challenges and propose future research directions in this novel research area.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments, facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation.

Abstract: Objective: We sought to develop a classification algorithm to extract diagnoses from free-text radiology reports of brain imaging performed in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based model, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain imaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from MIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was performed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by fine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2) Neu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT with MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness. We compared the performance of this model to Llama-2-13B, an autoregressive LLM. Results: The Neu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain abnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries. Llama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary classification accuracy. This result highlights potential limitations of current autoregressive LLMs for this specific classification task, though it remains possible that larger models or further fine-tuning could improve performance. Conclusion: Neu-RadBERT, enhanced through target domain pretraining and oversampling techniques, offered a robust tool for accurate and reliable diagnosis of neurological conditions from radiology reports. This study underscores the potential of transformer-based NLP models in automatically extracting diagnoses from free text reports with potential applications to both research and patient care.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and reliable models for practical applications.

Abstract: Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and tokenization algorithms.

Abstract: Dream2Image is the world's first dataset combining EEG signals, dream transcriptions, and AI-generated images. Based on 38 participants and more than 31 hours of dream EEG recordings, it contains 129 samples offering: the final seconds of brain activity preceding awakening (T-15, T-30, T-60, T-120), raw reports of dream experiences, and an approximate visual reconstruction of the dream. This dataset provides a novel resource for dream research, a unique resource to study the neural correlates of dreaming, to develop models for decoding dreams from brain activity, and to explore new approaches in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Available in open access on Hugging Face and GitHub, Dream2Image provides a multimodal resource designed to support research at the interface of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. It was designed to inspire researchers and extend the current approaches to brain activity decoding. Limitations include the relatively small sample size and the variability of dream recall, which may affect generalizability.

<title>Toward Uncertainty-Aware and Generalizable Neural Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.

<title>Developing a Sequential Deep Learning Pipeline to Model Alaskan Permafrost Thaw Under Climate Change</title>

Abstract: Changing climate conditions threaten the natural permafrost thaw-freeze cycle, leading to year-round soil temperatures above 0{\deg}C. In Alaska, the warming of the topmost permafrost layer, known as the active layer, signals elevated greenhouse gas release due to high carbon storage. Accurate soil temperature prediction is therefore essential for risk mitigation and stability assessment; however, many existing approaches overlook the numerous factors driving soil thermal dynamics. This study presents a proof-of-concept latitude-based deep learning pipeline for modeling yearly soil temperatures across multiple depths. The framework employs dynamic reanalysis feature data from the ERA5-Land dataset, static geologic and lithological features, sliding-window sequences for seasonal context, a derived scenario signal feature for long-term climate forcing, and latitude band embeddings for spatial sensitivity. Five deep learning models were tested: a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a Transformer, a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (Conv1DLSTM), a Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). Results showed solid recognition of latitudinal and depth-wise temperature discrepancies, with the GRU performing best in sequential temperature pattern detection. Bias-corrected CMIP5 RCP data enabled recognition of sinusoidal temperature trends, though limited divergence between scenarios were observed. This study establishes an end-to-end framework for adopting deep learning in active layer temperature modeling, offering seasonal, spatial, and vertical temperature context without intrinsic restrictions on feature selection.

Abstract: Medical AI faces challenges in privacy-preserving collaborative learning while ensuring fairness across heterogeneous healthcare institutions. Current federated learning approaches suffer from static architectures, slow convergence (45-73 rounds), fairness gaps marginalizing smaller institutions, and scalability constraints (15-client limit). We propose Adaptive Fair Federated Learning (AFFL) through three innovations: (1) Adaptive Knowledge Messengers dynamically scaling capacity based on heterogeneity and task complexity, (2) Fairness-Aware Distillation using influence-weighted aggregation, and (3) Curriculum-Guided Acceleration reducing rounds by 60-70%. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees with epsilon-fairness bounds, achieving O(T^{-1/2}) + O(H_max/T^{3/4}) rates. Projected results show 55-75% communication reduction, 56-68% fairness improvement, 34-46% energy savings, and 100+ institution support. The framework enables multi-modal integration across imaging, genomics, EHR, and sensor data while maintaining HIPAA/GDPR compliance. We propose MedFedBench benchmark suite for standardized evaluation across six healthcare dimensions: convergence efficiency, institutional fairness, privacy preservation, multi-modal integration, scalability, and clinical deployment readiness. Economic projections indicate 400-800% ROI for rural hospitals and 15-25% performance gains for academic centers. This work presents a seven-question research agenda, 24-month implementation roadmap, and pathways toward democratizing healthcare AI.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review -- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate, verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models, AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32 for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical results and implementation details will be updated at https://github.com/tmlr-group/AlphaApollo.

Abstract: This dataset provides responses to a standardized, bilingual (English-Hindi) Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire designed to evaluate the physical, physiological, and psychological characteristics of individuals according to classical Ayurvedic principles. The questionnaire consists of 24 multiple-choice items covering body features, appetite, sleep patterns, energy levels, and temperament. It was developed following AYUSH/CCRAS guidelines to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection. All questions are mandatory and neutrally phrased to minimize bias, and dosha labels (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) are hidden from participants. Data were collected via a Google Forms deployment, enabling automated scoring of responses to map individual traits to dosha-specific scores. The resulting dataset provides a structured platform for research in computational intelligence, Ayurvedic studies, and personalized health analytics, supporting analysis of trait distributions, correlations, and predictive modeling. It can also serve as a reference for future Prakriti-based studies and the development of intelligent health applications.

Abstract: The 2024 July Revolution in Bangladesh represents a landmark event in the study of civil resistance. This study investigates the central paradox of the success of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to quell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a mixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the conflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a disaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative analysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and mobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like the July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial role of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects, we specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence for a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect. Our Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an immediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We further demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break analysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in the conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of the first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th. A complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65) corroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying "excessive force against protesters" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide escalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent, non-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and accelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

<title>Bridging Reasoning to Learning: Unmasking Illusions using Complexity Out of Distribution Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06274</link>

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast, existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation.

Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse & noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and $(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation, agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for researchers.

Abstract: Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function. Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25 m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints, achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000 parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure. The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing climate.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation, especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors; however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism, establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation. In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video, and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events. However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on completely unseen cameras.

<title>Online Matching via Reinforcement Learning: An Expert Policy Orchestration Strategy</title>

Abstract: Online matching problems arise in many complex systems, from cloud services and online marketplaces to organ exchange networks, where timely, principled decisions are critical for maintaining high system performance. Traditional heuristics in these settings are simple and interpretable but typically tailored to specific operating regimes, which can lead to inefficiencies when conditions change. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns to orchestrate a set of such expert policies, leveraging their complementary strengths in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Building on the Adv2 framework (Jonckheere et al., 2024), our method combines expert decisions through advantage-based weight updates and extends naturally to settings where only estimated value functions are available. We establish both expectation and high-probability regret guarantees and derive a novel finite-time bias bound for temporal-difference learning, enabling reliable advantage estimation even under constant step size and non-stationary dynamics. To support scalability, we introduce a neural actor-critic architecture that generalizes across large state spaces while preserving interpretability. Simulations on stochastic matching models, including an organ exchange scenario, show that the orchestrated policy converges faster and yields higher system level efficiency than both individual experts and conventional RL baselines. Our results highlight how structured, adaptive learning can improve the modeling and management of complex resource allocation and decision-making processes.

Abstract: Automatic chord recognition (ACR) via deep learning models has gradually achieved promising recognition accuracy, yet two key challenges remain. First, prior work has primarily focused on audio-domain ACR, while symbolic music (e.g., score) ACR has received limited attention due to data scarcity. Second, existing methods still overlook strategies that are aligned with human music analytical practices. To address these challenges, we make two contributions: (1) we introduce POP909-CL, an enhanced version of POP909 dataset with tempo-aligned content and human-corrected labels of chords, beats, keys, and time signatures; and (2) We propose BACHI, a symbolic chord recognition model that decomposes the task into different decision steps, namely boundary detection and iterative ranking of chord root, quality, and bass (inversion). This mechanism mirrors the human ear-training practices. Experiments demonstrate that BACHI achieves state-of-the-art chord recognition performance on both classical and pop music benchmarks, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each module.

<title>From Description to Detection: LLM based Extendable O-RAN Compliant Blind DoS Detection in 5G and Beyond</title>

Abstract: The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.

<title>Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them</title>

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge, we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load), weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness (predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task, they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes, textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and human-readable explanations.

Abstract: Bootstrapped pretraining, i.e., the reuse of a pretrained base model for further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch. However, its effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling behavior of bootstrapped pretraining and find that its scaling efficiency diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to second-stage pretraining tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of tokens used to pretrain the base model. The joint dependence on first- and second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. Such saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining strategies: the more extensively a model is pretrained, the less additional benefit bootstrapping provides. Our findings provide practical insights for efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the reuse of overtrained models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) underpins mechanistic insight and the rational design of molecules and materials. We present a systematic, reproducible benchmark comparing quantum and classical machine learning models for BDE prediction using a chemically curated feature set encompassing atomic properties (atomic numbers, hybridization), bond characteristics (bond order, type), and local environmental descriptors. Our quantum framework, implemented in Qiskit Aer on six qubits, employs ZZFeatureMap encodings with variational ansatz (RealAmplitudes) across multiple architectures Variational Quantum Regressors (VQR), Quantum Support Vector Regressors (QSVR), Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), and Quantum Random Forests (QRF). These are rigorously benchmarked against strong classical baselines, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Comprehensive evaluation spanning absolute and relative error metrics, threshold accuracies, and error distributions shows that top-performing quantum models (QCNN, QRF) match the predictive accuracy and robustness of classical ensembles and deep networks, particularly within the chemically prevalent mid-range BDE regime. These findings establish a transparent baseline for quantum-enhanced molecular property prediction and outline a practical foundation for advancing quantum computational chemistry toward near chemical accuracy.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data. The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults. From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to only a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier through the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of generating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D CT images.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM), which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) for long-sequence processing, offering linear scaling and lower memory use. Yet, how contextual information flows across layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied. We present the first unified, token- and layer-level analysis of representation propagation in SSMs and TBMs. Using centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing, we characterize how representations evolve within and across layers. We find a key divergence: TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations, with diversity reemerging only in later layers, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but converge to homogenization deeper. Theoretical analysis and parameter randomization further reveal that oversmoothing in TBMs stems from architectural design, whereas in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics. These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

Abstract: We study fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds for model-free reinforcement learning in episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes. Existing model-free algorithms achieve minimax worst-case regret, but their gap-dependent bounds remain coarse and fail to fully capture the structure of suboptimality gaps. We address this limitation by establishing fine-grained gap-dependent regret bounds for both UCB-based and non-UCB-based algorithms. In the UCB-based setting, we develop a novel analytical framework that explicitly separates the analysis of optimal and suboptimal state-action pairs, yielding the first fine-grained regret upper bound for UCB-Hoeffding (Jin et al., 2018). To highlight the generality of this framework, we introduce ULCB-Hoeffding, a new UCB-based algorithm inspired by AMB (Xu et al.,2021) but with a simplified structure, which enjoys fine-grained regret guarantees and empirically outperforms AMB. In the non-UCB-based setting, we revisit the only known algorithm AMB, and identify two key issues in its algorithm design and analysis: improper truncation in the $Q$-updates and violation of the martingale difference condition in its concentration argument. We propose a refined version of AMB that addresses these issues, establishing the first rigorous fine-grained gap-dependent regret for a non-UCB-based method, with experiments demonstrating improved performance over AMB.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the body surface area (BSA) involved by a rash, such as psoriasis, is critical for assessing rash severity, selecting an initial treatment regimen, and following clinical treatment response. Attempts at segmentation of inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis perform markedly worse on darker skin tones, potentially impeding equitable care. We assembled a psoriasis dataset sourced from six public atlases, annotated for Fitzpatrick skin type, and added detailed segmentation masks for every image. Reference models based on U-Net, ResU-Net, and SETR-small are trained without tone information. On the tuning split we sweep decision thresholds and select (i) global optima and (ii) per Fitzpatrick skin tone optima for Dice and binary IoU. Adapting Fitzpatrick specific thresholds lifted segmentation performance for the darkest subgroup (Fitz VI) by up to +31 % bIoU and +24 % Dice on UNet, with consistent, though smaller, gains in the same direction for ResU-Net (+25 % bIoU, +18 % Dice) and SETR-small (+17 % bIoU, +11 % Dice). Because Fitzpatrick skin tone classifiers trained on Fitzpatrick-17k now exceed 95 % accuracy, the cost of skin tone labeling required for this technique has fallen dramatically. Fitzpatrick thresholding is simple, model-agnostic, requires no architectural changes, no re-training, and is virtually cost free. We demonstrate the inclusion of Fitzpatrick thresholding as a potential future fairness baseline.

Abstract: We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during conversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review. Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note generation with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk summarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary quality and agent productivity at scale.

<title>Gaussian Equivalence for Self-Attention: Asymptotic Spectral Analysis of Attention Matrix</title>

Abstract: Self-attention layers have become fundamental building blocks of modern deep neural networks, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly from the perspective of random matrix theory. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of the singular value spectrum of the attention matrix and establish the first Gaussian equivalence result for attention. In a natural regime where the inverse temperature remains of constant order, we show that the singular value distribution of the attention matrix is asymptotically characterized by a tractable linear model. We further demonstrate that the distribution of squared singular values deviates from the Marchenko-Pastur law, which has been believed in previous work. Our proof relies on two key ingredients: precise control of fluctuations in the normalization term and a refined linearization that leverages favorable Taylor expansions of the exponential. This analysis also identifies a threshold for linearization and elucidates why attention, despite not being an entrywise operation, admits a rigorous Gaussian equivalence in this regime.

Abstract: A central challenge in high-energy nuclear physics is to extract informative features from the high-dimensional final-state data of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) in order to enable reliable downstream analyses. Traditional approaches often rely on selected observables, which may miss subtle but physically relevant structures in the data. To address this, we introduce a Transformer-based autoencoder trained with a two-stage paradigm: self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. The pretrained encoder learns latent representations directly from unlabeled HIC data, providing a compact and information-rich feature space that can be adapted to diverse physics tasks. As a case study, we apply the method to distinguish between large and small collision systems, where it achieves significantly higher classification accuracy than PointNet. Principal component analysis and SHAP interpretation further demonstrate that the autoencoder captures complex nonlinear correlations beyond individual observables, yielding features with strong discriminative and explanatory power. These results establish our two-stage framework as a general and robust foundation for feature learning in HIC, opening the door to more powerful analyses of quark--gluon plasma properties and other emergent phenomena. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Giovanni-Sforza/MaskPoint-AMPT.

<title>Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Bootstrapping LLMs on Downstream Tasks</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components: the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the \textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input} component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the \textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be extended to other downstream tasks.

<title>Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design</title>

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents. First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over 15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

<title>Scaling LLM Multi-turn RL with End-to-end Summarization-based Context Management</title>

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO) comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes, Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes, Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%), recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR: 0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computing in enhancing malware detection through the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Our main objective is to investigate the performance of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm compared to SVM. A publicly available dataset containing raw binaries of Portable Executable (PE) files was used for the classification. The QSVM algorithm, incorporating quantum kernels through different feature maps, was implemented and evaluated on a local simulator within the Qiskit SDK and IBM quantum computers. Experimental results from simulators and quantum hardware provide insights into the behavior and performance of quantum computers, especially in handling large-scale computations for malware detection tasks. The work summarizes the practical experience with using quantum hardware via the Qiskit interfaces. We describe in detail the critical issues encountered, as well as the fixes that had to be developed and applied to the base code of the Qiskit Machine Learning library. These issues include missing transpilation of the circuits submitted to IBM Quantum systems and exceeding the maximum job size limit due to the submission of all the circuits in one job.

Abstract: The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models (LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and sequential ensembling. In parallel ensembling, we combine attribution scores assigned to each edge by different methods-e.g., by averaging or taking the minimum or maximum value. In the sequential ensemble, we use edge attribution scores obtained via EAP-IG as a warm start for a more expensive but more precise circuit identification method, namely edge pruning. We observe that both approaches yield notable gains on the benchmark metrics, leading to a more precise circuit identification approach. Finally, we find that taking a parallel ensemble over various methods, including the sequential ensemble, achieves the best results. We evaluate our approach in the BlackboxNLP 2025 MIB Shared Task, comparing ensemble scores to official baselines across multiple model-task combinations.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints will be made publicly available shortly.

Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metric.

Abstract: Edge devices have limited resources, which inevitably leads to situations where stream processing services cannot satisfy their needs. While existing autoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require alternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing services. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling Platform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both service- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling tailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a particular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a scaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The RASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous regression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling actions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and a reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge device. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in merely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing). By increasingly adding elasticity dimensions, RASK sustained the highest request load with 28% less SLO violations, compared to baselines.

Abstract: We present a method that models the evolution of an unbounded number of time series clusters by switching among an unknown number of regimes with linear dynamics. We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis using publicly available databases.

Abstract: We study quantum sparse recovery in non-orthogonal, overcomplete dictionaries: given coherent quantum access to a state and a dictionary of vectors, the goal is to reconstruct the state up to $\ell_2$ error using as few vectors as possible. We first show that the general recovery problem is NP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome this, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first quantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum subroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded projections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration error accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned sparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse state in polynomial time. As an application, we give the first framework for sparse quantum tomography with non-orthogonal dictionaries in $\ell_2$ norm, achieving query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{N}/\epsilon)$ in favorable regimes and reducing tomography to estimating only $K$ coefficients instead of $N$ amplitudes. In particular, for pure-state tomography with $m=O(N)$ dictionary vectors and sparsity $K=\widetilde{O}(1)$ on a well-conditioned subdictionary, this circumvents the $\widetilde{\Omega}(N/\epsilon)$ lower bound that holds in the dense, orthonormal-dictionary setting, without contradiction, by leveraging sparsity together with non-orthogonality. Beyond tomography, we analyze QOMP in the QRAM model, where it yields polynomial speedups over classical OMP implementations, and provide a quantum algorithm to estimate the mutual incoherence of a dictionary of $m$ vectors in $O(m/\epsilon)$ queries, improving over both deterministic and quantum-inspired classical methods.

Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys deliver immense volumes of transient detections, yet distinguishing real astrophysical signals (for example, explosive events) from bogus imaging artefacts remains a challenge. Convolutional neural networks are effectively used for real versus bogus classification; however, their reliance on opaque latent representations hinders interpretability. Here we show that large language models (LLMs) can approach the performance level of a convolutional neural network on three optical transient survey datasets (Pan-STARRS, MeerLICHT and ATLAS) while simultaneously producing direct, human-readable descriptions for every candidate. Using only 15 examples and concise instructions, Google's LLM, Gemini, achieves a 93% average accuracy across datasets that span a range of resolution and pixel scales. We also show that a second LLM can assess the coherence of the output of the first model, enabling iterative refinement by identifying problematic cases. This framework allows users to define the desired classification behaviour through natural language and examples, bypassing traditional training pipelines. Furthermore, by generating textual descriptions of observed features, LLMs enable users to query classifications as if navigating an annotated catalogue, rather than deciphering abstract latent spaces. As next-generation telescopes and surveys further increase the amount of data available, LLM-based classification could help bridge the gap between automated detection and transparent, human-level understanding.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn and evaluate a sequential decision rule, often referred to as a "policy", that maximizes the population-level benefit in an environment across possibly infinitely many time steps. However, the sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize overall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its major use cases through a data example. The library is publicly available on PyPI and Github (https://github.com/JianhanZhang/PyCFRL), and detailed tutorials can be found in the PyCFRL documentation (https://pycfrl-documentation.netlify.app).

Abstract: Sparse Ternary General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) remains under-optimized in existing libraries for Apple Silicon CPUs. We present a Sparse Ternary GEMM kernel optimized specifically for Apple's M-series processors. We propose a set of architecture-aware optimizations, including a novel blocked and interleaved sparse data format to improve memory locality, strategies to increase Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP), and NEON-based Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization to exploit data-level parallelism. Our scalar implementation achieves up to a 5.98x performance increase over a traditional Ternary Compressed Sparse Column (TCSC) baseline for large matrices with 50% ternary nonzero values (sparsity), reaching up to a 50.2% of the processor's theoretical peak performance, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels. Our vectorized implementation delivers up to a 5.59x performance increase for large matrices with 25% sparsity, and remains stable across varying sparsity levels.

Abstract: Compliance with maritime traffic rules is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vessels, yet training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to adhere to them is challenging. The behavior of RL agents is shaped by the training scenarios they encounter, but creating scenarios that capture the complexity of maritime navigation is non-trivial, and real-world data alone is insufficient. To address this, we propose a falsification-driven RL approach that generates adversarial training scenarios in which the vessel under test violates maritime traffic rules, which are expressed as signal temporal logic specifications. Our experiments on open-sea navigation with two vessels demonstrate that the proposed approach provides more relevant training scenarios and achieves more consistent rule compliance.

<title>Relational Database Distillation: From Structured Tables to Condensed Graph Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06980</link>

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) underpin the majority of global data management systems, where information is structured into multiple interdependent tables. To effectively use the knowledge within RDBs for predictive tasks, recent advances leverage graph representation learning to capture complex inter-table relations as multi-hop dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead and excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the computational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables. To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e., utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.

Abstract: We study the propagation of outliers in cyclic causal graphs with linear structural equations, tracing them back to one or several "root cause" nodes. We show that it is possible to identify a short list of potential root causes provided that the perturbation is sufficiently strong and propagates according to the same structural equations as in the normal mode. This shortlist consists of the true root causes together with those of its parents lying on a cycle with the root cause. Notably, our method does not require prior knowledge of the causal graph.

Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single \texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values, enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks. Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table on our project website: https://vla-survey.github.io .

<title>Pseudo-MDPs: A Novel Framework for Efficiently Optimizing Last Revealer Seed Manipulations in Blockchains</title>

Abstract: This study tackles the computational challenges of solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for a restricted class of problems. It is motivated by the Last Revealer Attack (LRA), which undermines fairness in some Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum (\$400B market capitalization). We introduce pseudo-MDPs (pMDPs) a framework that naturally models such problems and propose two distinct problem reductions to standard MDPs. One problem reduction provides a novel, counter-intuitive perspective, and combining the two problem reductions enables significant improvements in dynamic programming algorithms such as value iteration. In the case of the LRA which size is parameterized by $\kappa$ (in Ethereum's case $\kappa$ = 32), we reduce the computational complexity from O(2^$\kappa$ $\kappa$^2^($\kappa$+2)) to O($\kappa$^4) (per iteration). This solution also provide the usual benefits from Dynamic Programming solutions: exponentially fast convergence toward the optimal solution is guaranteed. The dual perspective also simplifies policy extraction, making the approach well-suited for resource-constrained agents who can operate with very limited memory and computation once the problem has been solved. Furthermore, we generalize those results to a broader class of MDPs, enhancing their applicability. The framework is validated through two case studies: a fictional card game and the LRA on the Ethereum random seed consensus protocol. These applications demonstrate the framework's ability to solve large-scale problems effectively while offering actionable insights into optimal strategies. This work advances the study of MDPs and contributes to understanding security vulnerabilities in blockchain systems.

Abstract: Explaining the behavior of predictive models with random inputs can be achieved through sub-models decomposition, where such sub-models have easier interpretable features. Arising from the uncertainty quantification community, recent results have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of a generalized Hoeffding decomposition for such predictive models when the stochastic input variables are correlated, based on concepts of oblique projection onto L 2 subspaces. This article focuses on the case where the input variables have Bernoulli distributions and provides a complete description of this decomposition. We show that in this case the underlying L 2 subspaces are one-dimensional and that the functional decomposition is explicit. This leads to a complete interpretability framework and theoretically allows reverse engineering. Explicit indicators of the influence of inputs on the output prediction (exemplified by Sobol' indices and Shapley effects) can be explicitly derived. Illustrated by numerical experiments, this type of analysis proves useful for addressing decision-support problems, based on binary decision diagrams, Boolean networks or binary neural networks. The article outlines perspectives for exploring high-dimensional settings and, beyond the case of binary inputs, extending these findings to models with finite countable inputs.

Abstract: In the ever-changing and intricate landscape of financial markets, portfolio optimisation remains a formidable challenge for investors and asset managers. Conventional methods often struggle to capture the complex dynamics of market behaviour and align with diverse investor preferences. To address this, we propose an innovative framework, termed Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning (DARL), which synergistically integrates Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for portfolio management. By leveraging DDPMs to generate synthetic market crash scenarios conditioned on varying stress intensities, our approach significantly enhances the robustness of training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DARL outperforms traditional baselines, delivering superior risk-adjusted returns and resilience against unforeseen crises, such as the 2025 Tariff Crisis. This work offers a robust and practical methodology to bolster stress resilience in DRL-driven financial applications.

Abstract: We train active neural-network flow controllers using a deep learning PDE augmentation method to optimize lift-to-drag ratios in turbulent airfoil flows at Reynolds number $5\times10^4$ and Mach number 0.4. Direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation are employed to model compressible, unconfined flow over two- and three-dimensional semi-infinite NACA 0012 airfoils at angles of attack $\alpha = 5^\circ$, $10^\circ$, and $15^\circ$. Control actions, implemented through a blowing/suction jet at a fixed location and geometry on the upper surface, are adaptively determined by a neural network that maps local pressure measurements to optimal jet total pressure, enabling a sensor-informed control policy that responds spatially and temporally to unsteady flow conditions. The sensitivities of the flow to the neural network parameters are computed using the adjoint Navier-Stokes equations, which we construct using automatic differentiation applied to the flow solver. The trained flow controllers significantly improve the lift-to-drag ratios and reduce flow separation for both two- and three-dimensional airfoil flows, especially at $\alpha = 5^\circ$ and $10^\circ$. The 2D-trained models remain effective when applied out-of-sample to 3D flows, which demonstrates the robustness of the adjoint-trained control approach. The 3D-trained models capture the flow dynamics even more effectively, which leads to better energy efficiency and comparable performance for both adaptive (neural network) and offline (simplified, constant-pressure) controllers. These results underscore the effectiveness of this learning-based approach in improving aerodynamic performance.

Abstract: Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust, adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power, we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g., empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small, high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this, we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph. Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves (epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity; and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed medical systems. However, their potential within specialized domains such as nursing remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiple choice question-answering (MCQ) tasks. We develop a multi-stage data generation pipeline to build the first large scale nursing MCQ dataset to train LLMs on a broad spectrum of nursing topics. We further introduce multiple nursing benchmarks to enable rigorous evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NurseLLM outperforms SoTA general-purpose and medical-specialized LLMs of comparable size on different benchmarks, underscoring the importance of a specialized LLM for the nursing domain. Finally, we explore the role of reasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems in nursing, highlighting their promise for future research and applications.

Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a critical task in investment. Most existing portfolio optimization methods require information on the distribution of returns of the assets that make up the portfolio. However, such distribution information is usually unknown to investors. Various methods have been proposed to estimate distribution information, but their accuracy greatly depends on the uncertainty of the financial markets. Due to this uncertainty, a model that could well predict the distribution information at one point in time may perform less accurately compared to another model at a different time. To solve this problem, we investigate a method for portfolio optimization based on Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS), one of the Bayesian ensemble methods for meta-learning. We assume that investors have access to multiple asset return prediction models. By using BPS with dynamic linear models to combine these predictions, we can obtain a Bayesian predictive posterior about the mean rewards of assets that accommodate the uncertainty of the financial markets. In this study, we examine how to construct mean-variance portfolios and quantile-based portfolios based on the predicted distribution information.

Abstract: Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples to transform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with a target coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strong performance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require to use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used for training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the use of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional labels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for split conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification tasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using unsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples previously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental results show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to that with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in performance guarantees and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning, but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.

Abstract: Quantum learning from remotely accessed quantum compute and data must address two key challenges: verifying the correctness of data and ensuring the privacy of the learner's data-collection strategies and resulting conclusions. The covert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides a framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In this work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning theory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote data access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We consider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii) target-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the unknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making quantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for learning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum statistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning from public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for solving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private classical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d. ancilla-free eavesdropper. The lattermost results in particular establish that the exponential separation between classical and quantum queries for Forrelation and Simon's problem survives under covertness constraints. Along the way, we design covert verifiable protocols for quantum data acquisition from public quantum queries which may be of independent interest. Overall, our models and corresponding algorithms demonstrate that quantum advantages are privately and verifiably achievable even with untrusted, remote data.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) promise to deliver exponential speed-ups in select computational tasks, yet their integration into modern deep learning pipelines remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards bridging this gap by presenting the first fully-coherent quantum implementation of a multilayer neural network with non-linear activation functions. Our constructions mirror widely used deep learning architectures based on ResNet, and consist of residual blocks with multi-filter 2D convolutions, sigmoid activations, skip-connections, and layer normalizations. We analyse the complexity of inference for networks under three quantum data access regimes. Without any assumptions, we establish a quadratic speedup over classical methods for shallow bilinear-style networks. With efficient quantum access to the weights, we obtain a quartic speedup over classical methods. With efficient quantum access to both the inputs and the network weights, we prove that a network with an $N$-dimensional vectorized input, $k$ residual block layers, and a final residual-linear-pooling layer can be implemented with an error of $\epsilon$ with $O(\text{polylog}(N/\epsilon)^k)$ inference cost.

Abstract: Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1 correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning. Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

Abstract: Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds. Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other across iterations. We performed an extensive characterization study of these new mechanisms, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, and show they incur non-negligible overheads when the model is large or uses large embedding tables. Motivated by the analysis, we propose Cocoon, a hardware-software co-designed framework for efficient training with correlated noises. Cocoon accelerates models with embedding tables through pre-computing and storing correlated noises in a coalesced format (Cocoon-Emb), and supports large models through a custom near-memory processing device (Cocoon-NMP). On a real system with an FPGA-based NMP device prototype, Cocoon improves the performance by 2.33-10.82x(Cocoon-Emb) and 1.55-3.06x (Cocoon-NMP).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.

Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN.

Abstract: Meta-learning is an effective method to handle imbalanced and noisy-label learning, but it depends on a validation set containing randomly selected, manually labelled and balanced distributed samples. The random selection and manual labelling and balancing of this validation set is not only sub-optimal for meta-learning, but it also scales poorly with the number of classes. Hence, recent meta-learning papers have proposed ad-hoc heuristics to automatically build and label this validation set, but these heuristics are still sub-optimal for meta-learning. In this paper, we analyse the meta-learning algorithm and propose new criteria to characterise the utility of the validation set, based on: 1) the informativeness of the validation set; 2) the class distribution balance of the set; and 3) the correctness of the labels of the set. Furthermore, we propose a new imbalanced noisy-label meta-learning (INOLML) algorithm that automatically builds a validation set by maximising its utility using the criteria above. Our method shows significant improvements over previous meta-learning approaches and sets the new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that safeguards privacy by creating an impartial global model while respecting the privacy of individual client data. However, the conventional FL method can introduce security risks when dealing with diverse client data, potentially compromising privacy and data integrity. To address these challenges, we present a differential privacy (DP) federated deep learning framework in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we extend our similarity weight aggregation (SimAgg) method to DP-SimAgg algorithm, a differentially private similarity-weighted aggregation algorithm for brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our DP-SimAgg method not only enhances model segmentation capabilities but also provides an additional layer of privacy preservation. Extensive benchmarking and evaluation of our framework, with computational performance as a key consideration, demonstrate that DP-SimAgg enables accurate and robust brain tumor segmentation while minimizing communication costs during model training. This advancement is crucial for preserving the privacy of medical image data and safeguarding sensitive information. In conclusion, adding a differential privacy layer in the global weight aggregation phase of the federated brain tumor segmentation provides a promising solution to privacy concerns without compromising segmentation model efficacy. By leveraging DP, we ensure the protection of client data against adversarial attacks and malicious participants.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most effective techniques for regularizing deep learning models and improving their recognition performance in a variety of tasks and domains. However, this holds for standard in-domain settings, in which the training and test data follow the same distribution. For the out-of-domain case, where the test data follow a different and unknown distribution, the best recipe for data augmentation is unclear. In this paper, we show that for out-of-domain and domain generalization settings, data augmentation can provide a conspicuous and robust improvement in performance. To do that, we propose a simple training procedure: (i) use uniform sampling on standard data augmentation transformations; (ii) increase the strength transformations to account for the higher data variance expected when working out-of-domain, and (iii) devise a new reward function to reject extreme transformations that can harm the training. With this procedure, our data augmentation scheme achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark domain generalization datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of long-term risk is essential for the design and analysis of stochastic dynamical systems. Existing risk quantification methods typically rely on extensive datasets involving risk events observed over extended time horizons, which can be prohibitively expensive to acquire. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method for learning long-term risk probabilities using short-term samples with limited occurrence of risk events. Specifically, we establish that four distinct classes of long-term risk probabilities are characterized by specific partial differential equations (PDEs). Using this characterization, we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that combines empirical data with physics information to infer risk probabilities. We then analyze the theoretical properties of this framework in terms of generalization and convergence. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework not only generalizes effectively beyond the sampled states and time horizons but also offers additional benefits such as improved sample efficiency, rapid online inference capabilities under changing system dynamics, and stable computation of probability gradients. These results highlight how embedding PDE constraints, which contain explicit gradient terms and inform how risk probabilities depend on state, time horizon, and system parameters, improves interpolation and generalization between/beyond the available data.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional multilayer perceptrons. However, their reliance on predefined, bounded grids restricts their ability to approximate functions on unbounded domains. To address this, we present Unbounded Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (UKANs), a method that removes the need for bounded grids in traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The key innovation of this method is a coefficient-generator (CG) model that produces, on the fly, only the B-spline coefficients required locally on an unbounded symmetric grid. UKANs couple multilayer perceptrons with KANs by feeding the positional encoding of grid groups into the CG model, enabling function approximation on unbounded domains without requiring data normalization. To reduce the computational cost of both UKANs and KANs, we introduce a GPU-accelerated library that lowers B-spline evaluation complexity by a factor proportional to the grid size, enabling large-scale learning by leveraging efficient memory management, in line with recent software advances such as FlashAttention and FlashFFTConv. Performance benchmarking confirms the superior memory and computational efficiency of our accelerated KAN (warpKAN), and UKANs, showing a 3-30x speed-up and up to 1000x memory reduction compared to vanilla KANs. Experiments on regression, classification, and generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of UKANs to match or surpass KAN accuracy. Finally, we use both accelerated KAN and UKAN in a molecular property prediction task, establishing the feasibility of large-scale end-to-end training with our optimized implementation.

Abstract: In deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), the learning rate critically influences both stability and performance, yet its optimal value shifts during training as the environment and policy evolve. Standard decay schedulers assume monotonic convergence and often misalign with these dynamics, leading to premature or delayed adjustments. We introduce LRRL, a meta-learning approach that dynamically selects the learning rate based on policy performance rather than training steps. LRRL adaptively favors rates that improve returns, remaining robust even when the candidate set includes values that individually cause divergence. Across Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, LRRL achieves performance competitive with or superior to tuned baselines and standard schedulers. Our findings position LRRL as a practical solution for adapting to non-stationary objectives in deep RL.

One such popular domain where RL has been effective is resource management problems in systems. We look to extend work on RL for resource management problems by considering the novel domain of dynamic memory allocation management. We consider dynamic memory allocation to be a suitable domain for RL since current algorithms like first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit can fail to adapt to changing conditions and can lead to fragmentation and suboptimal efficiency. In this paper, we present a framework in which an RL agent continuously learns from interactions with the system to improve memory management tactics. We evaluate our approach through various experiments using high-level and low-level action spaces and examine different memory allocation patterns. Our results show that RL can successfully train agents that can match and surpass traditional allocation strategies, particularly in environments characterized by adversarial request patterns. We also explore the potential of history-aware policies that leverage previous allocation requests to enhance the allocator's ability to handle complex request patterns. Overall, we find that RL offers a promising avenue for developing more adaptive and efficient memory allocation strategies, potentially overcoming limitations of hardcoded allocation algorithms.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.

Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.

Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.

Abstract: With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.

Abstract: Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for informing decisions and policies that will protect the planet. Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used to do this task more effectively, yet there lacks a systematic review on the most recent working combinations of ML methods and multiple RS sources, especially with the consideration of the forests' ecological characteristics. This study systematically analyzed 25 papers that met strict inclusion criteria from over 80 related studies, identifying all ML methods and combinations of RS data used. Random Forest had the most frequent appearance (88\% of studies), while Extreme Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in 75\% of the studies in which it was compared with other methods. Sentinel-1 emerged as the most utilized remote sensing source, with multi-sensor approaches (e.g., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR) proving especially effective. Our findings provide grounds for recommending which sensing sources, variables, and methods to consider using when integrating ML and RS for forest AGB estimation.

Abstract: Clustering based on vibration responses, such as transmissibility functions (TFs), is promising in structural anomaly detection. However, most existing methods struggle to determine the optimal cluster number, handle high-dimensional streaming data, and rely heavily on manually engineered features due to their shallow structures. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel clustering framework, referred to as Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning (DPGIIL), for online structural anomaly detection, which combines the advantages of deep generative models (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference, a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the evidence lower bound, is derived analytically, which enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby allowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process. Additionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational inference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary statistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain information about previous data for incremental learning. For online structural anomaly detection, DPGIIL can not only detect anomalies by dynamically assigning incoming data to new clusters but also indicate different structural states using distinct clusters, thereby providing additional information about the operating conditions of the monitored structure compared to traditional anomaly detectors. Three case studies demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method and show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in both structural anomaly detection and clustering.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to address the statistical heterogeneity of data across clients by learning the personalized model for each client. Among various PFL approaches, the personalized aggregation-based approach conducts parameter aggregation in the server-side aggregation phase to generate personalized models, and focuses on learning appropriate collaborative relationships among clients for aggregation. However, the collaborative relationships vary in different scenarios and even at different stages of the FL process. To this end, we propose Personalized Federated Learning with Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (FedAGHN), which employs Attentive Graph HyperNetworks (AGHNs) to dynamically capture fine-grained collaborative relationships and generate client-specific personalized initial models. Specifically, AGHNs empower graphs to explicitly model the client-specific collaborative relationships, construct collaboration graphs, and introduce tunable attentive mechanism to derive the collaboration weights, so that the personalized initial models can be obtained by aggregating parameters over the collaboration graphs. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the superiority of FedAGHN. Moreover, a series of visualizations are presented to explore the effectiveness of collaboration graphs learned by FedAGHN.

<title>A Dual-Agent Adversarial Framework for Robust Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, empowered with the powerful capabilities of neural networks, reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully tackled numerous challenging tasks. However, while these models demonstrate enhanced decision-making abilities, they are increasingly prone to overfitting. For instance, a trained RL model often fails to generalize to even minor variations of the same task, such as a change in background color or other minor semantic differences. To address this issue, we propose a dual-agent adversarial policy learning framework, which allows agents to spontaneously learn the underlying semantics without introducing any human prior knowledge. Specifically, our framework involves a game process between two agents: each agent seeks to maximize the impact of perturbing on the opponent's policy by producing representation differences for the same state, while maintaining its own stability against such perturbations. This interaction encourages agents to learn generalizable policies, capable of handling irrelevant features from the high-dimensional observations. Extensive experimental results on the Procgen benchmark demonstrate that the adversarial process significantly improves the generalization performance of both agents, while also being applied to various RL algorithms, e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). With the adversarial framework, the RL agent outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin, especially in hard-level tasks, marking a significant step forward in the generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Hierarchical data is common in many domains like life sciences and e-commerce, and its embeddings often play a critical role. While hyperbolic embeddings offer a theoretically grounded approach to representing hierarchies in low-dimensional spaces, current methods often rely on specific geometric constructs as embedding candidates. This reliance limits their generalizability and makes it difficult to integrate with techniques that model semantic relationships beyond pure hierarchies, such as ontology embeddings. In this paper, we present RegD, a flexible Euclidean framework that supports the use of arbitrary geometric regions -- such as boxes and balls -- as embedding representations. Although RegD operates entirely in Euclidean space, we formally prove that it achieves hyperbolic-like expressiveness by incorporating a depth-based dissimilarity between regions, enabling it to emulate key properties of hyperbolic geometry, including exponential growth. Our empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets shows consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates RegD's potential for broader applications such as the ontology embedding task that goes beyond hierarchy.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of large language models to adversarial attacks, where adversaries craft specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. In this work, we study their worst-case robustness, i.e., whether an adversarial example exists that leads to such undesirable outputs. We upper bound the worst-case robustness using stronger white-box attacks, indicating that most current deterministic defenses achieve nearly 0\% worst-case robustness. We propose a general tight lower bound for randomized smoothing using fractional knapsack solvers or 0-1 knapsack solvers, and using them to bound the worst-case robustness of all stochastic defenses. Based on these solvers, we provide theoretical lower bounds for several previous empirical defenses. For example, we certify the robustness of a specific case, smoothing using a uniform kernel, against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the phenomena of generalization and memorization in diffusion models. Empirical studies suggest that these phenomena are influenced by model complexity and the size of the training dataset. In our experiments, we further observe that the number of noise samples per data sample ($m$) used during Denoising Score Matching (DSM) plays a significant and non-trivial role. We capture these behaviors and shed insights into their mechanisms by deriving asymptotically precise expressions for test and train errors of DSM under a simple theoretical setting. The score function is parameterized by random features neural networks, with the target distribution being $d$-dimensional Gaussian. We operate in a regime where the dimension $d$, number of data samples $n$, and number of features $p$ tend to infinity while keeping the ratios $\psi_n=\frac{n}{d}$ and $\psi_p=\frac{p}{d}$ fixed. By characterizing the test and train errors, we identify regimes of generalization and memorization as a function of $\psi_n,\psi_p$, and $m$. Our theoretical findings are consistent with the empirical observations.

Abstract: Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance compared to CTC and the more recently proposed Consistency-Regularized CTC, though with a trade-off in ASR performance. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is highly desirable. However, existing methods often struggle with balancing unlearning efficacy and retain model utility, and lack controllability at inference time to emulate base model behavior as if it had never seen the unlearned data. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning method grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis and operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to activation regions that expresses its inability to answer. We show that contrastive features are not a prerequisite for effective activation redirection, and LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance and superior controllability. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x and 11.7x improvement in the combined unlearning efficacy and model utility score (Deviation Score) across various base models and generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses post-unlearning. Moreover, LUNAR effectively reduces parameter updates to a single down-projection matrix, a novel design that significantly enhances efficiency by 20x and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust to white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in real-world scenarios, including handling sequential unlearning requests.

Abstract: Molecular design involves an enormous and irregular search space, where traditional optimizers such as Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and generative models struggle to leverage expert knowledge or handle complex feedback. Recently, LLMs have been used as optimizers, achieving promising results on benchmarks such as PMO. However, existing approaches rely only on prompting or extra training, without mechanisms to handle complex feedback or maintain scalable memory. In particular, the common practice of appending or summarizing experiences at every query leads to redundancy, degraded exploration, and ultimately poor final outcomes under large-scale iterative search. We introduce ExLLM (Experience-Enhanced LLM optimization), an LLM-as-optimizer framework with three components: (1) a compact, evolving experience snippet tailored to large discrete spaces that distills non-redundant cues and improves convergence at low cost; (2) a simple yet effective k-offspring scheme that widens exploration per call and reduces orchestration cost; and (3) a lightweight feedback adapter that normalizes objectives for selection while formatting constraints and expert hints for iteration. ExLLM sets new state-of-the-art results on PMO and generalizes strongly in our setup, it sets records on circle packing and stellarator design, and yields consistent gains across additional domains requiring only a task-description template and evaluation functions to transfer.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly advanced tasks such as multimodal question answering by grounding responses in external text and images. This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.

Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) offers a promising approach for distributed model training in wireless networks, combining the layer-partitioning advantages of split learning with the federated aggregation that ensures global convergence. However, in heterogeneous wireless environments, disparities in device capabilities and channel conditions make strict round-based synchronization heavily straggler-dominated, thereby limiting both efficiency and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Collaborative Split Federated Learning (CSFL), that redefines workload redistribution through device-to-device collaboration. Building on the flexibility of model partitioning, CSFL enables efficient devices, after completing their own forward propagation, to seamlessly take over the unfinished layers of bottleneck devices. This collaborative process, supported by D2D communications, allows bottleneck devices to offload computation earlier while maintaining synchronized progression across the network. Beyond the system design, we highlight key technical enablers such as privacy protection, multi-perspective matching, and incentive mechanisms, and discuss practical challenges including matching balance, privacy risks, and incentive sustainability. A case study demonstrates that CSFL significantly reduces training latency without compromising convergence speed or accuracy, underscoring collaboration as a key enabler for synchronization-efficient learning in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration (VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where agents are deployed over an undirected, connected graph/network with arbitrary topology -- but without a centralized node, that is, a node capable of aggregating all data and performing computations. Each agent constructs a nonparametric B-Map from its private data, operating on Q-functions represented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with flexibility in choosing the basis for their representation. Agents exchange their Q-function estimates only with direct neighbors, and unlike existing DRL approaches that restrict communication to Q-functions, the proposed framework also enables the transmission of basis information in the form of covariance matrices, thereby conveying additional structural details. Linear convergence rates are established for both Q-function and covariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values, regardless of the network topology, with optimal learning rates determined by the ratio of the smallest positive eigenvalue (the graph's Fiedler value) to the largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix. A detailed performance analysis further shows that the proposed DRL framework effectively approximates the performance of a centralized node, had such a node existed. Numerical tests on two benchmark control problems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps relative to prior methods. Notably, the tests reveal a counter-intuitive outcome: although the framework involves richer information exchange -- specifically through transmitting covariance matrices as basis information -- it achieves the desired performance at a lower cumulative communication cost than existing DRL schemes, underscoring the critical role of sharing basis information in accelerating the learning process.

Abstract: In deep learning, processing multidimensional inputs (e.g., images, medical scans, and time series) is an important task that often requires flattening the inputs. We introduce $\mathit{NdLinear}$, a drop-in replacement for linear layers that operates directly on tensors, requiring no flattening. By applying transformations separately along each dimension, NdLinear preserves native data structure while achieving dramatic parameter reductions, often by orders of magnitude, with minimal memory overhead. We prove NdLinear maintains expressivity through structured Tucker decomposition while preserving VC-dimension scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to achieve significant parameter reductions with substantial wall-clock efficiency gains and minimal memory overhead. For instance, our $\mathit{NdLinear-LoRA}$ matches or exceeds standard LoRA on language reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer parameters. Experiments across CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and MLPs on vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks consistently demonstrate NdLinear's efficiency gains. While excelling at axis-separable tasks, NdLinear has limitations with entangled spatial interactions. By processing data in its original N-dimensional form, NdLinear provides a theoretically grounded, practical component for building more efficient neural architectures.

Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades off between bias and variance.

Abstract: The growing use of smartphones and IoT devices necessitates efficient time-series analysis on resource-constrained hardware, which is critical for sensing applications such as human activity recognition and air quality prediction. Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.

Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing dimensional collapse, where higher-dimensional representation spaces ($R$) span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies involve guiding a model to produce $R$ with a higher dimensionality ($H(R)$) through objectives that encourage decorrelation of features or sample uniformity in $R$. A higher $H(R)$ indicates that $R$ has greater feature diversity which is useful for generalization to downstream tasks. Alongside dimensionality optimization, SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head that maps $R$ into an embedding space $Z$. Recent work has characterized the projection head as a filter of noisy or irrelevant features from the SSL objective by reducing the mutual information $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high $H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of SSL is lacking in terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences the relationship between both terms. Our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but effectively arrive at a balance between both. To take advantage of this analysis, we introduce AdaDim, a training strategy that leverages SSL training dynamics by adaptively balancing between increasing $H(R)$ through feature decorrelation and sample uniformity as well as gradual regularization of $I(R;Z)$ as training progresses. We show performance improvements of up to 3% over common SSL baselines despite our method not utilizing expensive techniques such as queues, clustering, predictor networks, or student-teacher architectures.

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.

Abstract: We discover the emergence of \textit{basins} in the loss landscape of large language models. As model scale increases, LLMs become progressively more resilient to random perturbations in the parameter space, giving rise to expansive stability regions where models exhibit nearly identical performance, but outside of which their capabilities collapse. We observe that pre-training creates a \textit{basic capability} basin, and subsequent alignment fine-tuning forms \textit{specific capability} basins (e.g., safety, math, coding). Thus, we argue that benign fine-tuning confined to the basin should preserve prior capabilities. Besides, we also analyze the loss landscape for worst-case directions, which is consistently sharp and detrimental. We find that adversarial fine-tuning moves along the nearly worst-case directions, thus rapidly degrading model capabilities. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the basin size bounds the performance degradation of any fine-tuning, including the adversarial ones, while also guaranteeing the model robustness w.r.t. input perturbations, suggesting the benefit of enlarging basins.

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long contexts, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/HoPE.

Abstract: Natural-gradient methods markedly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), yet their Gauss--Newton update must be solved in the parameter space, incurring a prohibitive $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the number of network trainable weights. We show that exactly the same step can instead be formulated in a generally smaller residual space of size $m = \sum_{\gamma} N_{\gamma} d_{\gamma}$, where each residual class $\gamma$ (e.g. PDE interior, boundary, initial data) contributes $N_{\gamma}$ collocation points of output dimension $d_{\gamma}$.
  Building on this insight, we introduce \textit{Dual Natural Gradient Descent} (D-NGD). D-NGD computes the Gauss--Newton step in residual space, augments it with a geodesic-acceleration correction at negligible extra cost, and provides both a dense direct solver for modest $m$ and a Nystrom-preconditioned conjugate-gradient solver for larger $m$.
  Experimentally, D-NGD scales second-order PINN optimization to networks with up to 12.8 million parameters, delivers one- to three-order-of-magnitude lower final error $L^2$ than first-order methods (Adam, SGD) and quasi-Newton methods, and -- crucially -- enables natural-gradient training of PINNs at this scale on a single GPU.

Abstract: In scientific machine learning, models are routinely deployed with parameter values or boundary conditions far from those used in training. This paper studies the learning-where-to-learn problem of designing a training data distribution that minimizes average prediction error across a family of deployment regimes. A theoretical analysis shows how the training distribution shapes deployment accuracy. This motivates two adaptive algorithms based on bilevel or alternating optimization in the space of probability measures. Discretized implementations using parametric distribution classes or nonparametric particle-based gradient flows deliver optimized training distributions that outperform nonadaptive designs. Once trained, the resulting models exhibit improved sample complexity and robustness to distribution shift. This framework unlocks the potential of principled data acquisition for learning functions and solution operators of partial differential equations.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have become highly effective across various domains. However, real-world applications often require the generative process to adhere to certain constraints. To this end, we propose a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework that enables scalable inference-time control of discrete diffusion models through principled importance weighting and optimal proposal construction. Specifically, our approach derives tractable importance weights for a range of intermediate targets and characterises the optimal proposal, for which we develop two practical approximations: a first-order gradient-based approximation and an amortised proposal trained to minimise the log-variance of the importance weights. Empirical results across synthetic tasks, language modelling, biology design, and text-to-image generation demonstrate that our framework enhances controllability and sample quality, highlighting the effectiveness of SMC as a versatile recipe for scaling discrete diffusion models at inference time.

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated promising results in decoding hemodynamic responses captured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), particularly in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This work introduces AbsoluteNet, a novel deep learning architecture designed to classify auditory event-related responses recorded using fNIRS. The proposed network is built upon principles of spatio-temporal convolution and customized activation functions. Our model was compared against several models, namely fNIRSNET, MDNN, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. The results showed that AbsoluteNet outperforms existing models, reaching 87.0% accuracy, 84.8% sensitivity, and 89.2% specificity in binary classification, surpassing fNIRSNET, the second-best model, by 3.8% in accuracy. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning model in decoding hemodynamic responses related to auditory processing and highlight the importance of spatio-temporal feature aggregation and customized activation functions to better fit fNIRS dynamics.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NN) contain an ever-growing number of parameters, substantially increasing the memory and computational cost of inference. Researchers have explored various ways to reduce the inference cost of NNs by reducing the model size before deployment and dynamically pruning the inference computation at runtime. In this work, we present ExPrune, a general, dynamic pruning optimization that enables multi-granularity partial computation on a per-input basis. ExPrune requires no change to the model architecture or the training algorithm. ExPrune is based on our theoretical results that the relationship between certain model parameters and intermediate values can be described by a statistical property called exchangeability. By identifying exchangeable parameters and values in the model, we are able to first partially evaluate the network, analyze the statistics of the partial results, and make pruning decisions on the fly. Because ExPrune is theory grounded, it generalizes across model architectures in different problem domains. We evaluate ExPrune on one computer vision models, one graph model and one language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--17.33% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 21.61--27.16% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static magnitude pruning. On models that have been aggressively statically pruned, ExPrune still provides additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work has characterized the conditions under which any sequence minimizing the adversarial surrogate risk also minimizes the adversarial classification risk in the binary setting, a property known as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at which the adversarial classification risk approaches its optimal value along such a sequence. This paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as auto-compression, the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: As AI models generate increasingly realistic images, growing concerns over potential misuse underscore the need for reliable detection. Traditional supervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training and often fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can be guided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%.

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes. Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary, and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all $\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models -- particularly those that use long, latent chains of thought -- have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex, agentic tasks. However, as these models operate over increasingly extended time horizons, their internal progress becomes opaque to users, complicating expectation management and real-time oversight. In this work, we investigate whether real-time progress prediction is feasible. We discretize progress and train a linear probe to classify reasoning states. We then introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach that enables reasoning models to generate progress estimates (0$\rightarrow$100\%) during inference. Our best fine-tuned model achieves an average error of 10\% for sequences less than 16,000 tokens, offering a practical mechanism for monitoring and interpreting model reasoning in real time.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly face requirements to remove entire domains of information -- such as toxic language or biases -- rather than individual user data. This task presents a dilemma: full removal of the unwanted domain data is computationally expensive, while random partial removal is statistically inefficient. We find that a domain's statistical influence is often concentrated in a small subset of its data samples, suggesting a path between ineffective partial removal and unnecessary complete removal. We formalize this as distributional unlearning: a framework to select a small subset that balances forgetting an unwanted distribution while preserving a desired one. Using Kullback-Leibler divergence constraints, we derive the exact removal-preservation Pareto frontier for exponential families and prove that models trained on the edited data achieve corresponding log-loss bounds. We propose a distance-based selection algorithm and show it is quadratically more sample-efficient than random removal in the challenging low-divergence regime. Experiments across synthetic, text, and image datasets (Jigsaw, CIFAR-10, SMS spam) show our method requires 15-82% less deletion than full removal for strong unlearning effects, e.g., halving initial forget set accuracy. Ultimately, by showing a small forget set often suffices, our framework lays the foundations for more scalable and rigorous subpopulation unlearning.

Abstract: Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid in limited data regimes, such as in computational social science and human subjects research. While prior technical work has mainly explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (e.g., synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it remains unclear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address this challenge. Intriguingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data (i.e., when they are predictive of each other) can greatly improve estimates of the target parameter. We validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one. Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs--especially in multimodal settings--undermine reliability. We present a rigorous, information-geometric framework in diffusion dynamics that quantifies hallucination in MLLMs: model outputs are embedded spectrally on multimodal graph Laplacians, and gaps to a truth manifold define a semantic-distortion metric. We derive Courant--Fischer bounds on a temperature-dependent hallucination energy and use RKHS eigenmodes to obtain modality-aware, interpretable measures that track evolution over prompts and time. This reframes hallucination as measurable and bounded, providing a principled basis for evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification, and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, -- \,a quality-constrained \textbf{I}ntelligent \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{R}outing framework that dynamically selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms latency. The deployed system and additional product details are publicly available at https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/intelligent-prompt-routing/

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS) algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for learning deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates for high-resolution 3D physics simulations. We introduce a hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone architecture targeted for 3D physics simulations, which significantly outperforms existing architectures in terms of speed and accuracy. Our proposed network can be pretrained on small patches of the simulation domain, which can be fused to obtain a global solution, optionally guided via a fast and scalable sequence-to-sequence model to include long-range dependencies. This setup allows for training large-scale models with reduced memory and compute requirements for high-resolution datasets. We evaluate our backbone architecture against a large set of baseline methods with the objective to simultaneously learn the dynamics of 14 different types of PDEs in 3D. We demonstrate how to scale our model to high-resolution isotropic turbulence with spatial resolutions of up to $512^3$. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our network by training it as a diffusion model to produce probabilistic samples of highly turbulent 3D channel flows across varying Reynolds numbers, accurately capturing the underlying flow statistics.

Abstract: Auto-bidding serves as a critical tool for advertisers to improve their advertising performance. Recent progress has demonstrated that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which learns a conditional generative planner from offline data, achieves superior performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still face a performance bottleneck due to their inherent inability to explore beyond the static offline dataset. To address this, we propose {AIGB-Pearl} (\emph{{P}lanning with {E}valu{A}tor via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The core of AIGB-Pearl lies in constructing a trajectory evaluator for scoring generation quality and designing a provably sound KL-Lipschitz-constrained score maximization scheme to ensure safe and efficient exploration beyond the offline dataset. A practical algorithm incorporating the synchronous coupling technique is further devised to ensure the model regularity required by the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by illustrating how input modifications can change model predictions. In the multivariate time series domain, existing approaches often produce counterfactuals that lack validity, plausibility, or intuitive interpretability. We present \textbf{GenFacts}, a novel generative framework for producing plausible and actionable counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. GenFacts introduces a structured approach to latent space modeling and targeted counterfactual synthesis.
  We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture recognition as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts consistently outperforms baseline methods in plausibility metrics (+18.7\%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in user studies. These results underscore that realism and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are vital for actionable counterfactuals in time series applications.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs in the Hilbert space: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and improved interpretability.

Abstract: This study uses controlled simulations with known ground-truth parameters to evaluate how Distributional Latent Variable Models (DLVM) and Bayesian Distributional Active LEarning (DALE) perform in comparison to conventional Independent Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials. These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVM's cross-task inference with DALE's optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more efficient cognitive assessments.

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

Abstract: This extended abstract describes our solution for the Traffic4Cast Challenge 2019. The task requires modeling both fine-grained (pixel-level) and coarse (region-level) spatial structure while preserving temporal relationships across long sequences. Building on Conv-LSTM ideas, we introduce a tile-aware, cascaded-memory Conv-LSTM augmented with cross-frame additive attention and a memory-flexible training scheme: frames are sampled per spatial tile so the model learns tile-local dynamics and per-tile memory cells can be updated sparsely, paged, or compressed to scale to large maps. We provide a compact theoretical analysis (tight softmax/attention Lipschitz bound and a tiling error lower bound) explaining stability and the memory-accuracy tradeoffs, and empirically demonstrate improved scalability and competitive forecasting performance on large-scale traffic heatmaps.

Abstract: The neural tangent kernel is a kernel function defined over the parameter distribution of an infinite width neural network. Despite the impracticality of this limit, the neural tangent kernel has allowed for a more direct study of neural networks and a gaze through the veil of their black box. More recently, it has been shown theoretically that the Laplace kernel and neural tangent kernel share the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space in the space of $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ alluding to their equivalence. In this work, we analyze the practical equivalence of the two kernels. We first do so by matching the kernels exactly and then by matching posteriors of a Gaussian process. Moreover, we analyze the kernels in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and experiment with them in the task of regression.

<title>Attacking the Spike: On the Transferability and Security of Spiking Neural Networks to Adversarial Examples</title>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.

Abstract: We present a new general framework for segmentation of MRI scans based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. The pipeline proceeds in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Unlike most prior TDA uses in medical image segmentation, which are typically embedded within deep networks, our approach is a standalone method tailored to MRI. A key ingredient is the localization of representative cycles from the persistence diagram, which enables interpretable mappings from topological features to anatomical components. In particular, the method offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated datasets. Its modular design makes it adaptable to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We validate the framework on three applications: glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected; myocardium in cardiac MRI, forming a cylinder; and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles. We compare our method with established supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to condense datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While diffusion models now lead all generative benchmarks, current distillation methods avoid them and rely instead on GANs or autoencoders, or, at best, sampling from a fixed diffusion prior. This trend arises because naive backpropagation through the long denoising chain leads to vanishing gradients, which prevents effective synthetic sample optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M), the first method to learn gradient-based distilled latents and class embeddings end-to-end through a pre-trained latent diffusion model. A linearly decaying skip connection, injected from the initial noisy state into every reverse step, preserves the gradient signal across dozens of timesteps without requiring diffusion weight fine-tuning. Across multiple ImageNet subsets at 128x128 and 256x256, LD3M improves downstream accuracy by up to 4.8 percentage points (1 IPC) and 4.2 points (10 IPC) over the prior state-of-the-art. The code for LD3M is provided at https://github.com/Brian-Moser/prune_and_distill.

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) blueprint, enabling the training of neural networks to reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.

<title>Testing Support Size More Efficiently Than Learning Histograms</title>

arXiv:2410.18915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider two problems about an unknown probability distribution $p$:
  1. How many samples from $p$ are required to test if $p$ is supported on $n$ elements or not? Specifically, given samples from $p$, determine whether it is supported on at most $n$ elements, or it is "$\epsilon$-far" (in total variation distance) from being supported on $n$ elements.
  2. Given $m$ samples from $p$, what is the largest lower bound on its support size that we can produce?
  The best known upper bound for problem (1) uses a general algorithm for learning the histogram of the distribution $p$, which requires $\Theta(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log n})$ samples. We show that testing can be done more efficiently than learning the histogram, using only $O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n} \log(1/\epsilon))$ samples, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\Omega(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n})$. This algorithm also provides a better solution to problem (2), producing larger lower bounds on support size than what follows from previous work. The proof relies on an analysis of Chebyshev polynomial approximations outside the range where they are designed to be good approximations, and the paper is intended as an accessible self-contained exposition of the Chebyshev polynomial method.

arXiv:2411.04975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference

Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.

Abstract: We present OLMo 2, the next generation of our fully open language models. OLMo 2 includes a family of dense autoregressive language models at 7B, 13B and 32B scales with fully released artifacts -- model weights, full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. In this work, we describe our modified model architecture and training recipe, focusing on techniques for achieving better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from T\"ulu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to training compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 2 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with open-weight only models of comparable size and even some proprietary models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT 4o Mini.

arXiv:2501.05408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are often defined in terms of temporal relationships: a tensor at one timestep may depend on tensors from earlier or later timesteps. Such dynamic dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while eager DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; graph-based systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs.
  We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with recurrent tensors, which include explicit temporal dimensions. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using symbolic expressions to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a symbolic dependence graph, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and efficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian Eclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. To our best knowledge, this dataset features more than 10 times number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public dataset.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples that inputs with small, carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification, making adversarial attacks an essential tool for robustness evaluation. Existing black-box attacks fall into three categories: query-only, transfer-only, and query-and-transfer, and vary in perturbation pattern and optimization strategy. However, no prior method jointly achieves query-and-transfer guidance, pixel-wise sparsity, and training-free direct optimization, leaving a gap between black-box flexibility and white-box precision. We present GreedyPixel, a new attack framework that fills this gap by combining a surrogate-derived pixel priority map with greedy, per-pixel optimization refined by query feedback. This design reduces the exponential brute-force search space to a tractable linear procedure, guarantees monotonic loss decrease and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum, and concentrates perturbations on robust, semantically meaningful pixels to improve perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet under both white-box and black-box settings demonstrate that GreedyPixel achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and produces visually imperceptible perturbations. Our results show that GreedyPixel bridges the precision gap between white-box and black-box attacks and provides a practical framework for fine-grained robustness evaluation. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/greedypixel.

Abstract: This paper introduces Discrete Markov Probabilistic Models (DMPMs), a novel discrete diffusion algorithm for discrete data generation. The algorithm operates in discrete bit space, where the noising process is a continuous-time Markov chain that flips labels uniformly at random. The time-reversal process, like the forward noise process, is a jump process with its intensity governed by a discrete analogue of the classical score function. Crucially, this intensity is proven to be the conditional expectation of a function of the forward process, underlining theoretical alignment with score-based generative models. We establish convergence bounds for the algorithm under minimal assumptions, ensuring robustness and efficiency, which we demonstrate through experiments on low-dimensional Bernoulli-distributed datasets and high-dimensional binary MNIST data. The results highlight competitive performance in generating discrete structures compared to the state-of-the-art. This work bridges theoretical foundations and practical applications, advancing the development of effective and theoretically grounded discrete generative modeling.

Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the discrete-time exponential-weights dynamic with a constant step size on all \emph{general-sum and symmetric} $2 \times 2$ normal-form games, i.e. games with $2$ pure strategies per player, and where the ensuing payoff tuple is of the form $(A,A^\top)$ (where $A$ is the $2 \times 2$ payoff matrix corresponding to the first player). Such symmetric games commonly arise in real-world interactions between "symmetric" agents who have identically defined utility functions -- such as Bertrand competition, multi-agent performative prediction, and certain congestion games -- and display a rich multiplicity of equilibria despite the seemingly simple setting. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through a first-principles analysis that the exponential weights dynamic, which is popular in online learning, converges in the last iterate for such games regardless of initialization with an appropriately chosen step size. For certain games and/or initializations, we further show that the convergence rate is in fact exponential and holds for any step size.
  We illustrate our theory with extensive simulations and applications to the aforementioned game-theoretic interactions. In the case of multi-agent performative prediction, we formulate a new "mortgage competition" game between lenders (i.e. banks) who interact with a population of customers, and show that it fits into our framework.

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs respond to prompts with either compliance or refusal, each corresponding to distinct directions in the model's activation space. Recent works show that initializing attacks via self-transfer from other prompts significantly enhances their performance. However, the underlying mechanisms of these initializations remain unclear, and attacks utilize arbitrary or hand-picked initializations. This work presents that each gradient-based jailbreak attack and subsequent initialization gradually converge to a single compliance direction that suppresses refusal, thereby enabling an efficient transition from refusal to compliance. Based on this insight, we propose CRI, an initialization framework that aims to project unseen prompts further along compliance directions. We demonstrate our approach on multiple attacks, models, and datasets, achieving an increased attack success rate (ASR) and reduced computational overhead, highlighting the fragility of safety-aligned LLMs. A reference implementation is available at: https://amit1221levi.github.io/CRI-Jailbreak-Init-LLMs-evaluation.

arXiv:2503.01505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.

<title>Improving Neutral Point-of-View Generation with Data- and Parameter-Efficient RL</title>

Abstract: The paper shows that parameter-efficient reinforcement learning (PE-RL) is a highly effective training regime to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e. to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. This is shown by evaluating PE-RL and multiple strong baselines-including LoRA finetuning (strongest baseline), SFT and RLHF. PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating sufficient answers from "great'' answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative analysis corroborates this. Moreover, our evaluation also finds a key property of PE-RL for this task: unlike methods that update all parameters, it generalises out of topic. Finally, to enable further studies we also release the dataset, SHQ-NPOV, and provide a methodology to create such datasets through iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training.

<title>DiffMI: Breaking Face Recognition Privacy via Diffusion-Driven Training-Free Model Inversion</title>

Abstract: Face recognition poses serious privacy risks due to its reliance on sensitive and immutable biometric data. While modern systems mitigate privacy risks by mapping facial images to embeddings (commonly regarded as privacy-preserving), model inversion attacks reveal that identity information can still be recovered, exposing critical vulnerabilities. However, existing attacks are often computationally expensive and lack generalization, especially those requiring target-specific training. Even training-free approaches suffer from limited identity controllability, hindering faithful reconstruction of nuanced or unseen identities. In this work, we propose DiffMI, the first diffusion-driven, training-free model inversion attack. DiffMI introduces a novel pipeline combining robust latent code initialization, a ranked adversarial refinement strategy, and a statistically grounded, confidence-aware optimization objective. DiffMI applies directly to unseen target identities and face recognition models, offering greater adaptability than training-dependent approaches while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves 84.42%--92.87% attack success rates against inversion-resilient systems and outperforms the best prior training-free GAN-based approach by 4.01%--9.82%. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/DiffMI.

<title>Efficient Flow Matching using Latent Variables</title>

arXiv:2505.04486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly utilize the underlying clustering structure in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides efficient training strategies by conditioning on the features extracted from data using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on synthetic data from multi-modal distributions and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by adopting pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Beyond natural images, we consider generative modeling of spatial fields stemming from physical processes. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competing approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.

<title>Is Supervised Learning Really That Different from Unsupervised?</title>

arXiv:2505.11006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised learning can be decomposed into a two-stage procedure, where (1) all model parameters are selected in an unsupervised manner, and (2) the outputs y are added to the model, without changing the parameter values. This is achieved by a new model selection criterion that, in contrast to cross-validation, can be used also without access to y. For linear ridge regression, we bound the asymptotic out-of-sample risk of our method in terms of the optimal asymptotic risk. We also demonstrate on real and synthetic data that versions of linear and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks, which are trained without access to y, perform similarly to their standard y-based counterparts. Hence, our results suggest that the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is less fundamental than it may appear.

<title>TokenWeave: Efficient Compute-Communication Overlap for Distributed LLM Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11329</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2505.11329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead.
  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on Hopper and Blackwell NVIDIA GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains.
  Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.

<title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18356</link>

arXiv:2505.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

<title>Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20309</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2505.20309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained, adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight, trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

arXiv:2505.20612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP! Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/roboflow/rf100-vl and https://universe.roboflow.com/rf100-vl/.

<title>MetaSlot: Break Through the Fixed Number of Slots in Object-Centric Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.20772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: AI agents have significant potential to reshape cybersecurity, making a thorough assessment of their capabilities critical. However, existing evaluations fall short, because they are based on small-scale benchmarks and only measure static outcomes, failing to capture the full, dynamic range of real-world security challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale benchmark featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities across 188 software projects. Adjustable to different vulnerability analysis settings, CyberGym primarily tasks agents with generating a proof-of-concept test that reproduces a vulnerability, given only its text description and the corresponding codebase. Our extensive evaluation highlights that CyberGym effectively differentiates agents' and models' cybersecurity capabilities. Even the top-performing combinations only achieve a ~20% success rate, demonstrating the overall difficulty of CyberGym. Beyond static benchmarking, we show that CyberGym leads to the discovery of 35 zero-day vulnerabilities and 17 historically incomplete patches. These results underscore that CyberGym is not only a robust benchmark for measuring AI's progress in cybersecurity but also a platform for creating direct, real-world security impact.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8% without platform-specific tuning.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas, enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches - Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our evaluation across approximately 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian Mixture Copula Models consistently surpass Gaussian Copula Models and perform better than, or at least comparably to, Gaussian Mixture Models, as measured by both log-likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results are promising for the adoption of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models as a statistical foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

<title>Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.

<title>Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_* \geq 1$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of \( \kappa_* \) to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( R d \sqrt{{KT}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $R$ is the norm of the vector of rewards and $K$ is the number of outcomes. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( RdK \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(Rd\sqrt{KT/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our algorithm is minimax-optimal and that our definition of $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

Abstract: Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/.

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio. These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.

<title>An Investigation of Robustness of LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning: Benchmarking with Mathematically-Equivalent Transformation of Advanced Mathematical Problems</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 51.5% on the originals but drops by 4.7 percentage points on surface-renaming variants, and by 12.9 percentage points on parametric variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots. The complete source code of the framework is publicly available at https://github.com/snt-arg/robot_suite.

<title>Enhancing GraphQL Security by Detecting Malicious Queries Using Large Language Models, Sentence Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching, introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls, offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments (including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

<title>From Injection to Defense: Constructing Edit-Based Fingerprints for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Fingerprinting is critical for maintaining traceability and protecting the intellectual property (IP) of developers, as LLMs deployed in web applications are susceptible to unauthorized redistribution and misuse via fine-tuning or black-box deployment. However, current backdoor-based fingerprinting methods face a fundamental trade-off: fingerprints embedded as garbled text are easily detected and filtered, whereas those crafted as coherent natural language are prone to being triggered unintentionally. To overcome these limitations, we propose RFEdit, a knowledge-editing framework that embeds a rule-based multilingual natural language fingerprint (MNLF) by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This approach enables efficient and robust fingerprint injection with minimal impact on unrelated knowledge in LLMs. Our RFEdit framework is further safeguarded by Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which mitigates fingerprint degradation during legitimate fine-tuning by restricting parameter updates to the fingerprint subspace. This approach preserves fingerprint integrity while enhancing downstream task performance of LLMs. These advances establish a comprehensive pipeline from fingerprint injection to defense, achieving high detection effectiveness, robustness against adversarial manipulations, harmlessness to model utility, and persistence under fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFEdit maintains robustness under quantization and pruning. Additionally, fingerprint effectiveness is generally improved by more than 10\% when combined with FSFT for math and alpaca downstream tasks.

arXiv:2509.12658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce RoLA, a framework that transforms any in-the-wild image into an interactive, physics-enabled robotic environment. Unlike previous methods, RoLA operates directly on a single image without requiring additional hardware or digital assets. Our framework democratizes robotic data generation by producing massive visuomotor robotic demonstrations within minutes from a wide range of image sources, including camera captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our approach combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection. We demonstrate RoLA's versatility across applications like scalable robotic data generation and augmentation, robot learning from Internet images, and single-image real-to-sim-to-real systems for manipulators and humanoids.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.

arXiv:2509.25033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning extends to the critical dimension of privacy, particularly in human-centric federated learning (FL) settings where decentralized data necessitates an equitable distribution of privacy risk across clients. This paper introduces FinP, a novel framework specifically designed to address disparities in privacy risk by mitigating disproportionate vulnerability to source inference attacks (SIA). FinP employs a two-pronged strategy: (1) server-side adaptive aggregation, which dynamically adjusts client contributions to the global model to foster fairness, and (2) client-side regularization, which enhances the privacy robustness of individual clients. This comprehensive approach directly tackles both the symptoms and underlying causes of privacy unfairness in FL. Extensive evaluations on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate FinP's effectiveness, achieving improvement in fairness-in-privacy on HAR and CIFAR-10 with minimal impact on utility. FinP improved group fairness with respect to disparity in privacy risk using equal opportunity in CIFAR-10 by 57.14% compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, FinP significantly mitigates SIA risks on CIFAR-10, underscoring its potential to establish fairness in privacy within FL systems without compromising utility.

Summary: 
SoftAdaClip is a new differentially private training method that aims to improve model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. It replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. Evaluations on various datasets show that SoftAdaClip significantly reduces subgroup disparities compared to traditional DP-SGD and Adaptive-DPSGD methods. The method reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% and 48%, respectively, and these reductions are statistically significant. The results highlight the importance of integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms for achieving fair and private model training. <div>

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations. Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and private model training.

<div> Jailbreaking, Language models, Prompt guards, AI safety, Attack surface <br />
Summary: 
The study discusses a new attack method that bypasses prompt guards in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the limitations of existing defenses. The attack successfully breaches production models like Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro) and DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink) while preserving response quality. It exploits a resource imbalance between the prompt guard and the main LLM by encoding a jailbreak prompt that the lightweight guards cannot decipher but the main model can. This underscores the vulnerability of lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and stresses the importance of shifting the focus from filtering malicious inputs to preventing harmful outputs. The researchers also note other alignment issues, including the extraction of copyrighted and training data, as well as the potential leakage of malicious responses during LLM processing.  <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update. In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards, highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok (3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and malicious response leakage during thinking.

<div> framework, time series forecasting, LLM-driven, agent-based, interpretable<br />
Summary:<br />TSci is introduced as an LLM-driven agentic framework for time series forecasting, consisting of four specialized agents: Curator, Planner, Forecaster, and Reporter. Curator uses LLM-guided diagnostics for targeted preprocessing, Planner narrows model choices, Forecaster fits models and adapts strategies, and Reporter synthesizes the process into transparent reports. TSci outperforms statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by 10.4% and 38.2% on average. The framework's transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports enhance interpretability and extensibility across tasks, transforming the forecasting workflow into a white-box system. Empirical results on eight benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TSci in improving forecast accuracy and transparency in the forecasting process. <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.

<div> protein backbone generation, generative models, score distillation, few-step generators, protein design

Summary:
In the realm of protein design, diffusion- and flow-based generative models have shown promise but are hindered by slow generation speeds. To address this limitation, score distillation techniques have been explored to train few-step protein backbone generators that reduce sampling time while maintaining high quality. By adapting Score Identity Distillation (SiD) and incorporating multistep generation with inference time noise modulation, significant improvements in sampling speed have been achieved without sacrificing designability, diversity, or novelty compared to the Proteina teacher model. This advancement paves the way for large-scale protein design applications, bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering use. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Summary:

BrowserArena is a live open-web agent evaluation platform that assesses agent performance on user-submitted tasks through head-to-head comparisons and step-level human feedback. The study identifies three key failure modes in current web agents: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By creating targeted datasets for these tasks, researchers discovered differences in how language models address these challenges. For instance, o4-mini shows diverse strategies in circumventing captchas, while DeepSeek-R1 consistently struggles with pop-up banner closure. These findings highlight the variety and fragility of existing web agents. The benchmarking methodology used in this study offers a scalable approach to assessing and understanding web agent failure modes.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about pop-up banner closure. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.

arXiv:2510.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics, especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box" models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy. Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs. 0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4) Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and efficiency.

Summary: 
The study focuses on analyzing the use of transformer models in financial applications with a specific emphasis on risk assessment and biases. By employing a transformer model for predictions, the researchers introduce a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to evaluate the impact of various assets on the model's decision-making process. The findings indicate that the model does not consider data volatility in its decision-making, raising concerns about its reliability in highly fluctuating market conditions. Additionally, the model demonstrates a bias towards data with lower-frequency price movements, potentially leading to skewed predictions. This research sheds light on the importance of thoroughly evaluating the factors influencing transformer models in financial contexts to enhance their effectiveness and mitigate potential risks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored. The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making. Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency price movements.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning in network security using a custom OpenAI Gym environment. The environment models brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services, incorporating realistic security trade-offs such as background traffic noise and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks within a zero-sum reward framework. The results show that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks, with the defender maintaining a strategic advantage across training episodes. Reward shaping and careful training scheduling are crucial for learning stability in this adversarial setting. The experiments also highlight the importance of complex defensive strategies like adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls. The paper provides implementation details, hyperparameter configurations, and architectural guidelines for future research in adversarial reinforcement learning for cybersecurity. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+ training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls. Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations, and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to real-world network security scenarios.

Summary:
Generative inverse design is proposed as a new approach to engineering optimization, moving away from single-point solutions to a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates. The framework is based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a probabilistic mapping between design parameters and performance. In a study on airfoil self-noise reduction, the CVAE framework generated 256 novel designs with a high validity rate. Evaluation showed that 77.2% of these designs outperformed the single optimal design found by a benchmark surrogate-based optimization method. This shift to generative design not only yields higher-quality solutions but also provides a variety of candidates for multi-criteria decision-making in engineering design processes. <div>

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output, is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance, enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline. The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\% validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118 peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance, while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new discretization of the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron model optimized for deep spiking neural networks. While the widely adopted Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron offers simplicity and efficiency, its linear dynamics limit expressiveness. The QIF neuron, with its nonlinear dynamics, has been less utilized due to training instability. The proposed discretization addresses this by deriving analytical formulations for surrogate gradient windows, ensuring training stability and minimizing gradient mismatch. Evaluation on various datasets including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet shows that the QIF-based method outperforms LIF-based approaches, demonstrating richer dynamics and practical scalability. Overall, this work presents the QIF neuron as a promising alternative to LIF neurons in deep SNNs, combining complexity with performance.

arXiv:2510.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations' parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep & Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects. Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively achieve dual-carbon goals.

<br />
Summary: 
This research introduces a novel model for accurately estimating battery capacity in electric vehicles (EVs) using self-supervised learning on privacy-friendly charging data. The model addresses challenges posed by limited labeled data and privacy regulations. By leveraging snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, the model learns rich, generalizable representations from fragmented and less feature-rich data. A key innovation is the use of contrastive learning to capture high-level similarities among charging data snippets. This approach enables the model to understand granular charging patterns within individual snippets and identify associative relationships across different snippets. The proposed model consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 31.9% lower test error even in challenging domain-shifted scenarios affected by manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts. <div>

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However, practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data -- let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context. With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark, even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer and age-induced distribution shifts.

Summary:
Fast Causal Attention (FCA) is introduced as an algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10% fewer operations. It accelerates matrix multiplications for operations in the forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product Mask(QK^T), by targeting special cases where one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. FCA achieves noticeable accelerations on GPU compared to default PyTorch implementations and Triton compiled kernels. The algorithm is developed based on algebraic identities uncovered through a combination of machine learning and combinatorial search techniques. FCA's efficiency in handling these specific matrix multiplications results in significant speedups and improved performance in computational tasks involving Causal Attention. It addresses the need for optimized computations in the context of attention mechanisms, particularly in deep learning models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search.

<div> quantization, KV cache, autoregressive LLMs, long-context, test-time scaling

Summary:
PatternKV is introduced as a novel quantization scheme for KV cache in autoregressive LLMs. The approach leverages the stable structure of the K cache and semantic regularities in the V cache to flatten the distribution and narrow the quantization range, improving fidelity in low-bit settings. By aligning KV vectors to representative patterns and quantizing only the residual, PatternKV addresses the limitations of existing quantization methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent 2-bit gains, a minor 4-bit drop compared to FP16, enhanced accuracy in long-context and test-time scaling scenarios, and increased throughput for larger batches. This approach enhances performance and efficiency in memory and bandwidth usage during inference processes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference, notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings. In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08% average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10% on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger batches.

<div> Keywords: Symbolic regression, logistic-gated operators, unit-aware thresholds, conditional logic, clinical anchors 
Summary: 
Logistic-gated operators (LGO) are proposed to enhance symbolic regression by incorporating unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. These differentiable gates, with learnable parameters, are embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. In health datasets, the hard-gate variant of LGO accurately recovers clinically plausible cut-points, with a high percentage falling within specified guidelines. The use of LGO results in compact symbolic equations with explicit thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors. The approach maintains competitive accuracy with strong symbolic regression baselines and allows for gate pruning on smooth tasks, preserving model parsimony. By turning interpretability into a modeling constraint, symbolic regression equipped with LGO offers a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness -- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit. Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Summary: 
OptiFLIDS is introduced as a novel approach for effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in critical IoT environments like smart homes and industrial systems. It addresses the challenge of limited data sharing by utilizing Federated Learning (FL) to enable collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. OptiFLIDS incorporates pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Additionally, a customized aggregation method is integrated to handle non-IID data distributions that may result in varying model structures.

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems, effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets, TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Summary:
- Traditional analyses struggle with disentangling unknown sources from observations due to simplified source models that do not accurately represent the data.
- Diffusion models, which can learn complex prior distributions from noisy and incomplete data, offer a solution to the source separation problem without the need for explicit assumptions about the sources.
- By leveraging multiple views, where different observations contain distinct linear transformations of the unknown sources, the method successfully separates sources even in scenarios where no individual source is observed and the data is noisy, incomplete, and of varying resolution.
- The learned diffusion models facilitate sampling from source priors, assessing source probability, and sampling from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation.
- The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through synthetic problems and real-world galaxy observations.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct, unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as real-world galaxy observations.

Summary: 
Ensembles of neural network weight matrices for MNIST classification were studied using Gaussian matrix models with permutation symmetry. The 13-parameter permutation invariant Gaussian matrix models proved effective in representing the correlated Gaussianity in weight matrices, even beyond the initialization step. Representation theoretic model parameters and graph-theoretic characterization of permutation invariant matrix observables provided an interpretable framework. Wasserstein distance was used to quantify the movement of distributions over training. Varied initialization regimes, regularization, layer depth, and width were tested, highlighting when departures from Gaussianity are enhanced. This formalism identified limits and demonstrated the development of more general yet interpretable models. <div>

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

The article introduces CMT-Benchmark, a dataset of 50 challenging condensed matter theory problems designed by expert researchers. It evaluates large language models' ability to solve these problems programmatically, highlighting current models' limitations in physical reasoning skills. The evaluation includes tasks such as Hartree-Fock, quantum Monte Carlo, and model building, with LLMs like GPT5 solving 30% of the problems on average. However, 18 problems remain unsolved by any model, indicating the need for improvement in AI capabilities. Experts identified strategies to create more difficult problems by interacting with LLMs. This benchmark aims to guide the development of more capable AI research assistants and tutors. <div>
arXiv:2510.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world. We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model, GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research assistants and tutors.

Summary: 
The study focuses on misspecified saddle point problems where the optimization objective relies on an unknown parameter learned concurrently from data. The framework integrates optimization and learning, offering more flexibility. Two algorithms based on accelerated primal-dual (APD) are proposed. The first approach extends APD by substituting parameter estimates into updates, achieving a convergence rate of O(log K / K). The second approach, a learning-aware variant, considers parameter dynamics by adjusting momentum updates, with a tighter O(1) constant and adaptive step-size via backtracking. Extension to problems with multiple optimal solutions shows the modified algorithm achieving an O(1/√K) rate. Empirical evaluation on a misspecified portfolio optimization problem demonstrates superior performance compared to existing algorithms. <div>

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy. Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

<div> framework, Lipschitz constant, neural networks, input perturbations, scalability
<br />
Summary: 
The article proposes a compositional framework for estimating the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, crucial for certifying their robustness to input perturbations. The framework is based on a generalized SDP approach that accommodates heterogeneous activation functions and allows for tight Lipschitz estimates with respect to various input-output pairs and sub-networks. By decomposing the SDP into smaller sub-problems, the computational complexity scales linearly with network depth. The algorithms developed, ECLipsE-Gen-Local, incorporate local input information to provide significantly faster and tighter Lipschitz bounds compared to global methods. The algorithms also yield upper bounds close to the exact Jacobian when the input region is small. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing close alignment between Lipschitz estimates and network robustness. <div>
arXiv:2510.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks. Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Summary:
- The study explores the performance of encoder-only and decoder-only language models on cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
- Decoder-only models perform poorly compared to encoder-only models in existing approaches for cross-modal adaptation.
- Scaling decoder-only models does not result in improved performance in this context.
- Two novel approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, are introduced to improve decoder-only model performance by mimicking bidirectionality in autoregressive models.
- Both new methods show significant improvements in overall performance for all tasks and adaptation methods, narrowing the performance gap between decoder-only and encoder-only models in cross-modal adaptation tasks for scientific machine learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs). We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation tasks to further scientific ML.

Summary:
The Decision Transformer (DT) model combines reinforcement learning with the transformer model for offline RL, focusing on maximizing action likelihood rather than cumulative rewards. Challenges include stitching trajectories and action extrapolation. Existing methods address these challenges individually but struggle when combined. To address this, the Action Gradient (AG) method is proposed, optimizing actions using Q-value gradients. Empirical results show significant performance improvements and even reaching state-of-the-art levels. AG provides a stable and efficient way to enhance DT-based algorithms, overcome challenges in offline RL, and improve overall performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift, however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

<div> Keywords: signed graph, deep neural network, frustration level, structural balance, implicit regularization <br />
Summary: <br />
The study examines the frustration level of the signed graph associated with deep neural networks, measuring proximity to structural balance. Pretrained deep convolutional neural networks consistently exhibit lower frustration levels than null models, suggesting less disorder encoded in the network. From a statistical physics perspective, this reduced frustration implies a more ordered behavior compared to null models, resembling a near-monotonic function. The observed near-monotonic behavior along the partial order defined by frustration highlights the tendency of deep convolutional neural networks towards ordered behavior. This phenomenon indicates a novel form of implicit regularization present in the network architecture. <div>
arXiv:2510.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider, we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models. From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural balance) means that the function representing the network behaves near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form of implicit regularization.

Summary:<br />
Large language models like ChatGPT have become valuable tools, but face security concerns due to hardware requirements and data privacy issues. Traditional LLMs often require remote server connections, making them vulnerable to network attacks. Additionally, fine-tuning sensitive tasks may expose private data, leaving models at risk of training data reproduction attacks. To address these issues, this work introduces DP-Adam-AC, an enhanced differentially private optimizer with adaptable gradient clipping. By applying this optimizer to localizable language models like Qwen2.5-0.5B and Bitnet-b1.58-2B, the study shows promising loss improvements with synthetic datasets. This approach aims to secure LLMs for use on consumer-grade devices and protect sensitive data during fine-tuning processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two synthetic datasets.

Summary: 
The study examines cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and finds they can be well represented by gamma mixtures. By analyzing similarity distributions between document embeddings and a reference query embedding, the researchers discover that these distributions often follow a gamma distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], or a gamma mixture. They suggest a heuristic model where hierarchical clustering of topics results in a gamma-mixture structure in similarity scores. Additionally, an expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed for fitting shifted gamma mixtures, offering a practical tool for modeling similarity distributions. This research provides insights into how embeddings can be effectively modeled using gamma mixtures, highlighting the potential benefits for understanding document similarities within a corpus. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores. Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity distributions.

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i) weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to existing regularization-based approaches.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in industrial processes. Modern sensing systems generate vast amounts of heterogeneous data in the form of tensors, requiring regression models that preserve tensor geometry while capturing nonlinear interactions. Existing tensor-based regressors are linear, while conventional neural networks lack nonlinearity until data flattening, resulting in the loss of spatial structure and high parameter counts. The TRNN combines the strengths of both paradigms, offering a solution that maintains tensor geometry while incorporating nonlinearity. By unifying these approaches, the TRNN aims to enhance understanding and analysis of complex industrial and mechanical processes that rely on high-dimensional data profiles, images, and dense point clouds. <div>
arXiv:2510.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous, high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two paradigms.

<div> Keywords: Direct Preference Optimization, large language models, preference alignment, reward model, sentiment generation

Summary:
Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO) is introduced as a method to address the limitations of existing approaches for aligning large language models. MADPO employs a two-step approach, first training a reward model to estimate preference margins, then using these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each training sample. This re-weighting scheme allows for granular control over the learning signal, amplifying the target margin for hard pairs and damping it for easy pairs. The method has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. Experimental validation on sentiment generation tasks shows that MADPO outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality, achieving significant performance gains. MADPO is established as a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment in language model training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative $\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs, allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method. Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to preference alignment.

Summary: 
Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (PIANO) is proposed for solving the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar physics. PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure from 2D boundary conditions, using Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC). The model prioritizes critical channels to capture the magnetic field's variations and enforces force-free and divergence-free conditions during training. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF dataset demonstrate PIANO's superior accuracy over state-of-the-art neural operators and consistency with physical characteristics of NLFFF data. The GitHub repository for this project is available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed from various solar active regions.

<div> Keywords: distributed data parallelism, adaptive optimizers, time-scale mismatch, MT-DAO, language-model pre-training

Summary: 
Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) can lead to bandwidth saturation due to frequent gradient communication among workers. Infrequent communication strategies like Local SGD suffer from a performance gap, attributed to a time-scale mismatch between optimizer momentum and gradient smoothing. To address this, MT-DAO optimizers utilize multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta to track dynamics across different time scales, with convergence guarantees provided. In language-model pre-training, MT-DAO eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming infrequent-communication methods and reducing training time on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO achieves target perplexity in fewer steps and less time compared to baseline DDP. It enables efficient cross-datacenter training and wide geographic area training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates, decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter training and training over wide geographic areas.

<div> Keywords: Quantizing, Key-Value Cache, Language Models, Attention Mechanism, Inference Efficiency

Summary: 
KVLinC is introduced to address the challenge of errors introduced by aggressive quantization of key-value caches in large language models (LLMs). The framework combines Hadamard rotation for reducing quantization errors in values with linear correction adapters to compensate for errors in quantized keys. Extensive evaluations on various model families show that KVLinC outperforms strong baselines while achieving higher KV-cache compression. Additionally, a custom attention kernel implementation results in significantly faster inference speeds, up to 2.55x faster than the Flash Attention baseline. This enables efficient long-context LLM inference and improves generation quality by mitigating the propagation of errors through the dot-product attention mechanism. The proposed framework shows promise in enhancing the efficiency and performance of LLMs in extreme low-precision scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this, we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer), a refined version of the PINNs framework that addresses issues related to redundancy in the encoder and spectral bias. By eliminating the need for the encoder to capture spatiotemporal correlations using self-attention, the S-Pformer reduces parameter count without sacrificing performance. Additionally, the integration of Fourier feature embeddings helps mitigate spectral bias, allowing for adaptive encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. The model surpasses the performance of traditional encoder-decoder PINNSformers and achieves or exceeds the performance of MLP models while significantly reducing the number of parameters needed. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder, and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Summary:
This paper addresses the problem of estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables using neural networks. Traditional methods for estimating KL divergence for continuous random variables face scalability issues with dimension and sample size. The proposed algorithm utilizes a shallow neural network with randomized hidden weights and biases, known as a random feature method. The algorithm is shown to achieve a KL divergence estimation error of O(m^-1/2 + T^-1/3) with high probability, where m represents the number of neurons and T denotes both the number of steps in the algorithm and the number of samples. This approach offers a more efficient way to estimate KL divergence compared to traditional methods, providing a theoretical guarantee of error bounds. <div>
arXiv:2510.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables, traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited data.

Summary:
One-shot forecasting is more accurate than autoregressive methods for predicting 24-hour proton flux profiles following Solar Proton Events (SPEs). Using a dataset of 40 SPEs from 1997-2017, the study evaluated different model configurations. Proton-only models performed better on original data, but proton+X-ray models showed improvement with trend-smoothed data. Trend-smoothing enhanced proton+X-ray model performance by reducing X-ray channel fluctuations. While trend-smoothed data generally yielded the best results, the top-performing model was trained on original data, indicating that model architecture can outweigh the benefits of data preprocessing. The findings highlight the importance of considering various factors in deep learning models for accurate SPE proton flux forecasting. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites, astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs. combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data, and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data preprocessing.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new technique called NoiseCurve to improve noise correlation in differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) training. DP-SGD aims to train deep learning models while enhancing privacy but often suffers from accuracy gaps compared to normal SGD training. The proposed NoiseCurve leverages model curvature, estimated from unlabeled data, to enhance cross-iteration noise correlation in DP-MF. Experiments across various datasets, models, and privacy parameters demonstrate significant and consistent accuracy improvements with NoiseCurve compared to traditional methods. This advancement in noise correlation techniques could lead to more effective privacy-preserving training in deep learning models.

arXiv:2510.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks. However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

<div> Keywords: Autoregressive decoding, Speculative decoding, Language models, Online learning, Self-speculative framework

Summary:
Draft, Verify, & Improve (DVI) is a new framework introduced to address the latency bottleneck caused by autoregressive decoding in large language models. Unlike many speculative decoding systems, DVI combines inference with continual online learning, eliminating the need for heavy offline training or extra components. By partitioning the model into a drafter and verifier, DVI uses verifier decisions during generation to update the drafter head, optimizing the process. The framework utilizes a KL->RL schedule, starting with online distillation and later introducing reward-masked cross-entropy with a policy-gradient term. DVI achieves a significant wall-time speedup on Spec-Bench, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches like EAGLE-2, with minimal data for training. Ablation studies show that DVI outperforms models using only online distillation, demonstrating the efficiency of training-aware self-speculation in achieving lossless speedups with minimal overhead. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL} schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$ wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware} self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs), highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology, and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems, pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains. Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large language models.

The paper introduces a novel framework called Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS) to address security risks posed by Large Language Model (LLM) agents using tools like Google Search. These risks include indirect prompt injections that can manipulate the agent, leading to data leakage. ARLAS trains two LLMs in a two-player zero-sum game: an attacker generating diverse prompt injections and an agent defending against them while completing tasks. A population-based learning framework ensures robustness against various attacks and prevents cyclic learning. Tested on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents trained with ARLAS show lower attack success rates and improved task success rates compared to the base model. The adversarial process yields a diverse set of challenging attacks, enhancing the agent's overall robustness. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model.

Summary:
This study focuses on meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where related tasks have similar optimal action-value functions. The researchers propose a linear representation for the optimal action-value function and introduce a Gaussian meta-prior over task-specific parameters. They develop two Thompson-style algorithms, MTSRL and MTSRL+, which leverage prior mean learning and posterior sampling for improved performance. By utilizing prior alignment techniques, the algorithms achieve meta-regret guarantees that surpass prior-independent Thompson sampling as the number of tasks increase. Simulations conducted in a recommendation environment demonstrate that MTSRL and MTSRL+ outperform traditional reinforcement learning and bandit meta-baselines after a short exploration period. This work provides the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style reinforcement learning with learned Q-priors and offers practical strategies for settings with multiple experiments. <div>

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions. Specifically, we posit a linear representation $Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $ \mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters $\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and (ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain $\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance $\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation, covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a novel framework, Quantile DeepGR4J, which combines a deep learning model with a quantile regression-based ensemble learning approach to enhance streamflow prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The model is extended from DeepGR4J to incorporate multi-step streamflow predictions and improve interval score quality. Experiments conducted using the CAMELS-Aus dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms baseline deep learning models in terms of predictive accuracy and interval score. Additionally, the model's ability to quantify uncertainty and identify extreme flow events make it suitable for flood risk evaluation, positioning it as a potential early warning system for flooding events. <div>

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality (interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, leading to challenges in collaborative server-client distributed training. To address these issues, Parameter-efficient Split Learning and Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ) are implemented to balance efficiency and performance. AMAQ compresses activations and gradients progressively from high to low precision, achieving higher generation and classification accuracy compared to fixed-precision approaches. It also improves training stability and reduces ultra-low bit representation collapse. Experiments show that AMAQ integrates well into multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference accuracy with minimal communication cost. This approach proves to be a practical and effective solution for collaborative training on low-resource devices. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8 bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches, delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition, it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces ATOM, a transformer neural operator for multitask molecular dynamics simulations. It addresses limitations of existing models by using a quasi-equivariant design without explicit molecular graphs and incorporating temporal attention for accurate parallel decoding. ATOM is pre-trained on the TG80 dataset, which includes over 2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds, enabling state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MD17, RMD17, and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across different time horizons. This approach allows for accurate, efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics predictions, enhancing computational drug discovery and materials science applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis- covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales, we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over 2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate, efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

<div> Method of Infinite Descent, optimisation, AION architecture, analytic structure, non-iterative convergence
<br />
Summary:
The article introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a new optimisation paradigm that solves the first-order optimality condition algebraically. It utilizes an exact, algebraic equation for the update step, eliminating the need for iterative updates. The AION architecture, designed to meet the requirements of Infinite Descent, demonstrates the principle by reaching the optimum in a single descent step in a test problem. This approach enables exact, non-iterative convergence, highlighting the power of analytic structure in model optimization. The concept of the Infinity Class is introduced, representing a new class of semi-analytically optimisable models with conditions for membership discussed. This innovation opens up possibilities for non-iterative learning and offers a pathway towards efficient model training. 
<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J. Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic, Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step. Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example, applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward non-iterative learning.

<div> orthogonalization, adaptive learning rates, large language models, optimizer design, deep learning <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces NorMuon, an optimizer that combines orthogonalization and neuron-level adaptive learning rates for large language models. By addressing the imbalance in neuron norms, NorMuon improves training efficiency and computational costs. The optimizer synergistically leverages the strengths of Muon and Adam, outperforming both on various model scales. NorMuon reduces condition numbers and ensures balanced parameter utilization, leading to better optimization results. The distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework enables practical deployment at scale. Experiments show NorMuon achieves a significant improvement in training efficiency compared to Adam and Muon while maintaining a comparable memory footprint. The study suggests that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary approaches, indicating new directions for optimizer design in deep learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process. NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices. Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel approach, MIDT-ECG, to enhance generative electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis for cardiac care. The model addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating time-frequency domain supervision and demographic conditioning to improve morphological fidelity and generate personalized, patient-specific physiological signals. The evaluation on the PTB-XL dataset demonstrates significant improvements in morphological coherence, privacy preservation, and clinical coherence. The model reduces interlead correlation error by 74%, enhances signal-to-noise ratio, and allows for personalized synthesis. In low-data scenarios, a classifier trained on datasets including synthetic ECGs achieves comparable performance to one trained only on real data. This approach enables the responsible use of generative AI in healthcare, providing high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogate ECG signals for personalized care when real data is limited. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity, clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by 4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%, while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Summary:<br />
This study explores the computational and expressive constraints of equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) for predicting crystalline structures using a circuit-complexity perspective. Analyzing the operations of EGNN layers on node features, atomic coordinates, and lattice matrices, the research shows that under specific conditions, EGNN models can be simulated by a uniform TC^0 threshold-circuit family of polynomial size. The study establishes a ceiling on the problem-solving capabilities of EGNNs within the TC^0 framework, offering insights into architectural enhancements required to surpass these limitations. This analysis complements existing results like the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, providing a foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning in crystalline systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions. Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic, symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision, embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth, $O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Summary: <br />Current pain assessment in hospitals often lacks accuracy, especially for sedated and cognitively impaired patients. This study explored the use of EEG and machine learning to classify high-pain versus low/no-pain epochs in healthy adults exposed to laser-evoked pain. Nine machine learning models were compared, with a support vector machine achieving 88.9% accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time. Feature importance analysis revealed key markers of pain physiology. A real-time XGBoost model maintained high accuracy and low latency, showing the feasibility of an EEG-based pain monitor in clinical settings. This research provides a promising pathway for validating EEG as a tool for assessing and monitoring pain levels in patients. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9% accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards clinical validation.

NeST-BO is a novel Bayesian optimization method that targets the Newton step by learning gradient and Hessian information simultaneously with Gaussian process surrogates. It selects evaluations based on a one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error, leading to inexact-Newton convergence. By optimizing the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces, it reduces the cost of learning curvature while maintaining step targeting. NeST-BO demonstrates faster convergence and lower regret compared to existing local and high-dimensional BO methods across various synthetic and real-world problems, even in cases with thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting. Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and high-dimensional BO baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces RLHF-COV and DPO-COV algorithms to address issues in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) for large language models. These issues include corrupted preference, reward overoptimization, and bias towards verbosity. The algorithms can mitigate these issues simultaneously in both offline and online settings. The DPO-COV algorithm shows equivalent performance to the RLHF-COV algorithm, demonstrating the equivalence between RLHF and DPO methods. The theoretical analysis proves the generalization ability of the DPO-COV algorithm, matching the best-known rates for simpler cases. Experiments showcase the effectiveness of the DPO-COV algorithm in improving training quality. Overall, these algorithms offer a straightforward implementation without requiring reward estimation and provide theoretical guarantees for generalization performance. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models (LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward \textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards \textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover, our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and online settings.

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph classification task and the link prediction task.

<div> factorization, sparse core, block diagonal wrappers, pruning algorithm, model compression

Summary:<br />
ARMOR is a novel post-training pruning algorithm designed to address the challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs). It factorizes each weight matrix into a 2:4 sparse core surrounded by two block diagonal matrices, acting as error correctors to preserve model quality. Through a block coordinate descent algorithm minimizing a proxy loss, ARMOR optimizes the selection of sparse cores and wrappers. The algorithm is proven mathematically to converge to a solution with a loss equal to or better than state-of-the-art pruning methods. Experimental results on Llama and Qwen model families show that ARMOR outperforms existing 2:4 pruning techniques across various downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves superior performance while maintaining the speedups in inference and memory footprint reductions of 2:4 pruning, striking a better balance between model compression and task accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation. To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm. Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a 2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors, offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional 2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off between model compression and task accuracy

<div> perturbation, stochastic gradient langevin dynamics, anchor, test-time adaptation, regularization

Summary:
LATTA introduces a novel approach to test-time adaptation by incorporating noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) and a stable weight anchor. This combination aims to regulate adaptation, preventing catastrophic forgetting and instability observed in existing methods like Tent. By exploring the local parameter space and maintaining a robust source pre-training, LATTA effectively adapts without sacrificing stability. Unlike previous Bayesian TTA methods, LATTA does not require architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo passes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Rotated-MNIST and CIFAR-10-C show that LATTA outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and EATA, improving average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while reducing performance variance. This positions LATTA as a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised TTA. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation (LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing performance variance.

<title>Permutation-Invariant Representation Learning for Robust and Privacy-Preserving Feature Selection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05535</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedCAPS-08BF.

<title>Critical attention scaling in long-context transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$ effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large context lengths.

<title>Generative Dynamic Graph Representation Learning for Conspiracy Spoofing Detection</title>

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns. Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science, biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs (i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs. In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods. Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees. These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to complete a task.

<title>(Token-Level) \textbf{InfoRMIA}: Stronger Membership Inference and Memorization Assessment for LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

<title>Riddled basin geometry sets fundamental limits to predictability and reproducibility in deep learning</title>

arXiv:2510.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning, including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces, to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive, require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method, that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to 59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512 samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy. Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally, we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a principled manner.

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary: top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens, whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality (e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with up to 32K token generations).

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution. Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs, i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space, and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder (DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential disentanglement.

<title>Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding with Latent Pattern Mining</title>

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis, social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However, current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood, effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies</title>

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons embedded in game sequences.

<title>Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation. We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

<title>DP-SNP-TIHMM: Differentially Private, Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Markov Models for Synthesizing Genome-Wide Association Datasets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05777</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05777</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training, enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon \in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional flexibility and utility.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records, supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

<title>Mitigating Premature Exploitation in Particle-based Monte Carlo for Inference-Time Scaling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation: it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode, known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique, Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately leading to higher-quality solutions.

<title>Multimodal Trajectory Representation Learning for Travel Time Estimation</title>

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics, while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/freshhxy/MDTI/

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare, and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties, demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information. While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task, modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents, ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for comparing more complex solutions.

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases, prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures: convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention (VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81 and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is provided.

arXiv:2510.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching (FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds, single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning, often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role, enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p = 0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency, establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world applications.

JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

<title>Sample Smart, Not Hard: Correctness-First Decoding for Better Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path. Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps. Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks.

<title>RamPINN: Recovering Raman Spectra From Coherent Anti-Stokes Spectra Using Embedded Physics</title>

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal. Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited scientific domains.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety, yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

arXiv:2510.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets. This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast, leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its cost.

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient learning for autonomous driving.

<title>BLISS: A Lightweight Bilevel Influence Scoring Method for Data Selection in Language Model Pretraining</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06048</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence, primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e., training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence) leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining 410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4 dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$ speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling. Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

<title>Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.

arXiv:2510.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash, especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%). Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/feedzai/biy-paper.

<title>Learning Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems (MoLDS) via Hybrid Tensor-EM Method</title>

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories. However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings, limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data, and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally, often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term \emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

<title>The Alignment Auditor: A Bayesian Framework for Verifying and Refining LLM Objectives</title>

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single, overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy and accountable AI.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet, what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

arXiv:2510.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters, namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors. The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

<title>Downsized and Compromised?: Assessing the Faithfulness of Model Compression</title>

arXiv:2510.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight, online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill, decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference, quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM systems. Code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/amai-gsu/LM-Meter.

We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks. On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills within a single policy.

<title>Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD</title>

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest, due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence. Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest (norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of independent interest.

<title>LLMs as Policy-Agnostic Teammates: A Case Study in Human Proxy Design for Heterogeneous Agent Teams</title>

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels, while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients (IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates - system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However, such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature (RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in CP.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond natural language, such as coding and science.

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited. Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere, clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness, demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization quality at scale.

<title>Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned TTI models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the significance of language models in economic applications.

<title>Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency, and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning, modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations, further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained model.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First, we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869 for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content standards.}

arXiv:2510.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments. We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each other.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring reliability in modern software systems requires rigorous pre-production testing across highly heterogeneous and evolving environments. Because exhaustive evaluation is infeasible, practitioners must decide how to allocate limited testing resources across configurations where failure probabilities may drift over time. Existing combinatorial optimization approaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary settings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that recasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our method is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that fuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample efficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline training scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability shifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and optimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work establishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration allocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad applicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains.

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of financial natural language processing (NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark. Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions. Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%, and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across diverse tasks, yet their effectiveness frequently depends on costly commercial APIs or cloud services. Model selection thus entails a critical trade-off between performance and cost: high-performing LLMs typically incur substantial expenses, whereas budget-friendly small language models (SLMs) are constrained by limited capabilities. Current research primarily proposes two routing strategies: pre-generation routing and cascade routing. Both approaches have distinct characteristics, with cascade routing typically offering superior cost-effectiveness and accuracy despite its higher latency. To further address the limitations of both approaches, we introduce SATER, a dual-mode compatible approach that fine-tunes models through shortest-response preference optimization and a confidence-aware rejection mechanism. SATER significantly reduces redundant outputs and response times, while improving both the performance of pre-generation routing and the efficiency of cascade routing. Experiments across three SLMs and six datasets, varying in type and complexity, demonstrate that SATER achieves comparable performance while consistently reducing computational costs by over 50\% and cascade latency by over 80\%.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis faces significant challenges due to limited dataset sizes and domain variability between studies. Traditional self-supervised learning methods inspired by computer vision often rely on positive and negative sample pairs, which can be problematic for neuroimaging data where defining appropriate contrasts is non-trivial. We propose adapting a recently developed Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA) to graph-structured fMRI data, providing a theoretically grounded approach that measures statistical dependence via density ratio decomposition in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),and applies HFMCA-based pretraining to learn robust and generalizable representations. Evaluations across five neuroimaging datasets demonstrate that our adapted method produces competitive embeddings for various classification tasks and enables effective knowledge transfer to unseen datasets.

<title>Agentic Misalignment: How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats</title>

Abstract: We stress-tested 16 leading models from multiple developers in hypothetical corporate environments to identify potentially risky agentic behaviors before they cause real harm. In the scenarios, we allowed models to autonomously send emails and access sensitive information. They were assigned only harmless business goals by their deploying companies; we then tested whether they would act against these companies either when facing replacement with an updated version, or when their assigned goal conflicted with the company's changing direction. In at least some cases, models from all developers resorted to malicious insider behaviors when that was the only way to avoid replacement or achieve their goals - including blackmailing officials and leaking sensitive information to competitors. We call this phenomenon agentic misalignment. Models often disobeyed direct commands to avoid such behaviors. In another experiment, we told Claude to assess if it was in a test or a real deployment before acting. It misbehaved less when it stated it was in testing and misbehaved more when it stated the situation was real. We have not seen evidence of agentic misalignment in real deployments. However, our results (a) suggest caution about deploying current models in roles with minimal human oversight and access to sensitive information; (b) point to plausible future risks as models are put in more autonomous roles; and (c) underscore the importance of further research into, and testing of, the safety and alignment of agentic AI models, as well as transparency from frontier AI developers (Amodei, 2025). We are releasing our methods publicly to enable further research.

<title>Aneurysm Growth Time Series Reconstruction Using Physics-informed Autoencoder</title>

Abstract: Arterial aneurysm (Fig.1) is a bulb-shape local expansion of human arteries, the rupture of which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US. Therefore, the prediction of arterial aneurysm rupture is of great significance for aneurysm management and treatment selection. The prediction of aneurysm rupture depends on the analysis of the time series of aneurysm growth history. However, due to the long time scale of aneurysm growth, the time series of aneurysm growth is not always accessible. We here proposed a method to reconstruct the aneurysm growth time series directly from patient parameters. The prediction is based on data pairs of [patient parameters, patient aneurysm growth time history]. To obtain the mapping from patient parameters to patient aneurysm growth time history, we first apply autoencoder to obtain a compact representation of the time series for each patient. Then a mapping is learned from patient parameters to the corresponding compact representation of time series via a five-layer neural network. Moving average and convolutional output layer are implemented to explicitly taking account the time dependency of the time series.
  Apart from that, we also propose to use prior knowledge about the mechanism of aneurysm growth to improve the time series reconstruction results. The prior physics-based knowledge is incorporated as constraints for the optimization problem associated with autoencoder. The model can handle both algebraic and differential constraints. Our results show that including physical model information about the data will not significantly improve the time series reconstruction results if the training data is error-free. However, in the case of training data with noise and bias error, incorporating physical model constraints can significantly improve the predicted time series.

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.

<title>Stratum: System-Hardware Co-Design with Tiered Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM for Efficient MoE Serving</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prevailing design for achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. MoE models use sparse gating to activate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving billion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models. However, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the massive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of serving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach that combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D DRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D DRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack and GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher internal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch enabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of higher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency differences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the z-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across layers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage prediction to boost NMP throughput. The Stratum system achieves up to 8.29x improvement in decoding throughput and 7.66x better energy efficiency across various benchmarks compared to GPU baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

<title>Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

<title>Minima and Critical Points of the Bethe Free Energy Are Invariant Under Deformation Retractions of Factor Graphs</title>

Abstract: In graphical models, factor graphs, and more generally energy-based models, the interactions between variables are encoded by a graph, a hypergraph, or, in the most general case, a partially ordered set (poset). Inference on such probabilistic models cannot be performed exactly due to cycles in the underlying structures of interaction. Instead, one resorts to approximate variational inference by optimizing the Bethe free energy. Critical points of the Bethe free energy correspond to fixed points of the associated Belief Propagation algorithm. A full characterization of these critical points for general graphs, hypergraphs, and posets with a finite number of variables is still an open problem. We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of length at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model to one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical points of the associated free energy. This result extends and unifies classical results that assume specific forms of collapsibility to prove uniqueness of the critical points of the Bethe free energy.

<title>Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models</title>

Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy (+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1 points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points). These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and improve ICU patient safety.

Abstract: We initiate an investigation of learning tasks in a setting where the learner is given access to two competing provers, only one of which is honest. Specifically, we consider the power of such learners in assessing purported properties of opaque models. Following prior work that considers the power of competing provers in different settings, we call this setting refereed learning.
  After formulating a general definition of refereed learning tasks, we show refereed learning protocols that obtain a level of accuracy that far exceeds what is obtainable at comparable cost without provers, or even with a single prover. We concentrate on the task of choosing the better one out of two black-box models, with respect to some ground truth. While we consider a range of parameters, perhaps our most notable result is in the high-precision range: For all $\varepsilon>0$ and ambient dimension $d$, our learner makes only one query to the ground truth function, communicates only $(1+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})\cdot\text{poly}(d)$ bits with the provers, and outputs a model whose loss is within a multiplicative factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ of the best model's loss. Obtaining comparable loss with a single prover would require the learner to access the ground truth at almost all of the points in the domain. To obtain this bound, we develop a technique that allows the learner to sample, using the provers, from a distribution that is not efficiently samplable to begin with. We find this technique to be of independent interest.
  We also present lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our protocols in a number of respects, including prover complexity, number of samples, and need for query access.

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields, and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world systems.

Abstract: Low rank inference on matrices is widely conducted by optimizing a cost function augmented with a penalty proportional to the nuclear norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$. However, despite the assortment of computational methods for such problems, there is a surprising lack of understanding of the underlying probability distributions being referred to. In this article, we study the distribution with density $f(X)\propto e^{-\lambda\Vert X\Vert_*}$, finding many of its fundamental attributes to be analytically tractable via differential geometry. We use these facts to design an improved MCMC algorithm for low rank Bayesian inference as well as to learn the penalty parameter $\lambda$, obviating the need for hyperparameter tuning when this is difficult or impossible. Finally, we deploy these to improve the accuracy and efficiency of low rank Bayesian matrix denoising and completion algorithms in numerical experiments.

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale, yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck, limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using \texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures achieve remarkable performance improvements, but their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit serving systems. To forecast the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across three state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models (200B- 671B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. With the resulting 150GB+ trace files, we perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. Taking wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, we demonstrate that minor architectural modifications leveraging our insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 6.3X and 4.0X average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work provides the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of MoE models at scale. Our profiling traces and analysis results are publicly available at {https://huggingface.co/datasets/core12345/MoE_expert_selection_trace.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache, evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction (SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte, establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained environments.

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian unitaries are fundamental building blocks of central continuous-variable quantum technologies such as quantum-optic interferometry and bosonic error-correction schemes. In this work, we present the first time-efficient algorithm for learning bosonic Gaussian unitaries with a rigorous analysis. Our algorithm produces an estimate of the unknown unitary that is accurate to small worst-case error, measured by the physically motivated energy-constrained diamond distance. Its runtime and query complexity scale polynomially with the number of modes, the inverse target accuracy, and natural energy parameters quantifying the allowed input energy and the unitary's output-energy growth.
  The protocol uses only experimentally friendly photonic resources: coherent and squeezed probes, passive linear optics, and heterodyne/homodyne detection. We then employ an efficient classical post-processing routine that leverages a symplectic regularization step to project matrix estimates onto the symplectic group. In the limit of unbounded input energy, our procedure attains arbitrarily high precision using only $2m+2$ queries, where $m$ is the number of modes. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient learning algorithm for a multiparameter family of continuous-variable unitaries.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates). We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and inference speedup.

Abstract: We study channel simulation and distributed matching, two fundamental problems with several applications to machine learning, using a recently introduced generalization of the standard rejection sampling (RS) algorithm known as Ensemble Rejection Sampling (ERS). For channel simulation, we propose a new coding scheme based on ERS that achieves a near-optimal coding rate. In this process, we demonstrate that standard RS can also achieve a near-optimal coding rate and generalize the result of Braverman and Garg (2014) to the continuous alphabet setting. Next, as our main contribution, we present a distributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling counterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam (2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma (Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed matching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching probability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our approach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST dataset.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex, multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis method based on forward feature perturbation.

<title>Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications. Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift, often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world deployment.

<title>Bilevel optimization for learning hyperparameters: Application to solving PDEs and inverse problems with Gaussian processes</title>

Abstract: Methods for solving scientific computing and inference problems, such as kernel- and neural network-based approaches for partial differential equations (PDEs), inverse problems, and supervised learning tasks, depend crucially on the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, the efficacy of such methods, and in particular their accuracy, stability, and generalization properties, strongly depends on the choice of hyperparameters. While bilevel optimization offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step. Our approach provides closed-form updates, eliminating the need for repeated costly PDE solves. As a result, each iteration of the outer loop reduces to a single linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and to PDE inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments highlight substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization. In particular, experiments with additive kernels and neural network-parameterized deep kernels demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Continual learning, the ability of a model to adapt to an ongoing sequence of tasks without forgetting the earlier ones, is a central goal of artificial intelligence. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, we analyze the limitations of continual learning in a tractable yet representative setting. In particular, we study one-hidden-layer quadratic neural networks trained by gradient descent on an XOR cluster dataset with Gaussian noise, where different tasks correspond to different clusters with orthogonal means. Our results obtain bounds on the rate of forgetting during train and test-time in terms of the number of iterations, the sample size, the number of tasks, and the hidden-layer size. Our results reveal interesting phenomena on the role of different problem parameters in the rate of forgetting. Numerical experiments across diverse setups confirm our results, demonstrating their validity beyond the analyzed settings.

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.

<title>PointNSP: Autoregressive 3D Point Cloud Generation with Next-Scale Level-of-Detail Prediction</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of -0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time, large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data quality and application-driven innovation.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for high-performance LLM inference services continues to grow. To meet this demand, a growing number of AI accelerators have been proposed, such as Google TPU, Huawei NPU, Graphcore IPU, and Cerebras WSE, etc. Most of these accelerators adopt multi-core architectures to achieve enhanced scalability, but lack the flexibility of SIMT architectures. Therefore, without careful configuration of the hardware architecture, as well as deliberate design of tensor parallelism and core placement strategies, computational resources may be underutilized, resulting in suboptimal inference performance.
  To address these challenges, we first present a multi-level simulation framework with both transaction-level and performance-model-based simulation for multi-core NPUs. Using this simulator, we conduct a systematic analysis and further propose the optimal solutions for tensor parallelism strategies, core placement policies, memory management methods, as well as the selection between PD-disaggregation and PD-fusion on multi-core NPUs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on representative LLMs and various NPU configurations. The evaluation results demonstrate that, our solution can achieve 1.32x-6.03x speedup compared to SOTA designs for multi-core NPUs across different hardware configurations. As for LLM serving, our work offers guidance on designing optimal hardware architectures and serving strategies for multi-core NPUs across various LLM workloads.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged access to global state information supervises the agent during early training to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and perceptually complex scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability, we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are directly encoded in the latent space.

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in a real-world experiment.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

<title>Transcribing Rhythmic Patterns of the Guitar Track in Polyphonic Music</title>

Abstract: Whereas chord transcription has received considerable attention during the past couple of decades, far less work has been devoted to transcribing and encoding the rhythmic patterns that occur in a song. The topic is especially relevant for instruments such as the rhythm guitar, which is typically played by strumming rhythmic patterns that repeat and vary over time. However, in many cases one cannot objectively define a single "right" rhythmic pattern for a given song section. To create a dataset with well-defined ground-truth labels, we asked expert musicians to transcribe the rhythmic patterns in 410 popular songs and record cover versions where the guitar tracks followed those transcriptions. To transcribe the strums and their corresponding rhythmic patterns, we propose a three-step framework. Firstly, we perform approximate stem separation to extract the guitar part from the polyphonic mixture. Secondly, we detect individual strums within the separated guitar audio, using a pre-trained foundation model (MERT) as a backbone. Finally, we carry out a pattern-decoding process in which the transcribed sequence of guitar strums is represented by patterns drawn from an expert-curated vocabulary. We show that it is possible to transcribe the rhythmic patterns of the guitar track in polyphonic music with quite high accuracy, producing a representation that is human-readable and includes automatically detected bar lines and time signature markers. We perform ablation studies and error analysis and propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and readability of the predicted rhythmic pattern sequence.

<title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>

Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.

Abstract: We present the Mellum models family, open-weight code completion models designed for interactive use in JetBrains IDEs. Mellums have 4B parameters, adopt a Llama-style architecture, and are pre-trained on ~4T tokens of permissively licensed, multi-language code. Our studies show that (i) careful data curation and staged training significantly improve the model's quality, (ii) editor-critical capabilities such as context packing are necessary for high-quality suggestions, and (iii) a compact, task-focused model can meet the cost and latency constraints of interactive completion.
  In the paper, we describe an end-to-end industrial pipeline for producing contextualized in-editor completion: disciplined data governance, multi-stage training that includes fill-in-the-middle and project context via supervised fine-tuning, and alignment via direct preference optimization using feedback from real-world scenarios. Our quality evaluations include both large-scale offline benchmarks and online telemetry from production deployments in JetBrains IDEs. Mellums are released under the Apache-2.0 license on HuggingFace, with a public model card providing a reproducible reference for practitioners. Our experience offers a pragmatic blueprint for taking a focused, open model from a research prototype to at scale production for hundreds of thousands of users.

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years, video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier. To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality, it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial applications.

<title>Towards Label-Free Biological Reasoning Synthetic Dataset Creation via Uncertainty Filtering</title>

arXiv:2510.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is expensive.

Abstract: We propose the Segmented Full-Song Model (SFS) for symbolic full-song generation. The model accepts a user-provided song structure and an optional short seed segment that anchors the main idea around which the song is developed. By factorizing a song into segments and generating each one through selective attention to related segments, the model achieves higher quality and efficiency compared to prior work. To demonstrate its suitability for human-AI interaction, we further wrap SFS into a web application that enables users to iteratively co-create music on a piano roll with customizable structures and flexible ordering.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000 images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under https://www.kaputt-dataset.com.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting. However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal component of large language model (LLM) post-training, and agentic RL extends this paradigm to operate as agents through multi-turn interaction and tool use. Scaling such systems exposes two practical bottlenecks: (1) context length grows rapidly during training, inflating memory usage and latency, and triggering out-of-memory (OOM) failures; and (2) intermediate tensors accumulate with context length, making cross-device data movement a major system bottleneck.
  We present EARL, a scalable system for efficient agentic RL. EARL designs a parallelism selector that dynamically adapts model and training parallelism across RL stages based on sequence length and system load, and a data dispatcher that performs layout-aware, decentralized exchange of intermediate data batches. Together, these components increase throughput, reduce long-context failures, and enable stable large-scale training of agentic LLMs without relying on hard limits or penalties of context length.

Abstract: A sum-product network (SPN) is a graphical model that allows several types of probabilistic inference to be performed efficiently. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol which tackles structure generation and parameter learning of SPNs. Additionally, we provide a protocol for private inference on SPNs, subsequent to training. To preserve the privacy of the participants, we derive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the honest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to disclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated SPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private inference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy of all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both homogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that our protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN learners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and memory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when increasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural networks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising. This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL.

Abstract: The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1 environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise and expressivity limitations are mitigated.

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved. We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images. These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly benign applications?

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated, highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt, noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale information for practical observability applications.

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments, with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

The HRNet structure is designed to maintain high-resolution representations from the initial to the final layers. By transforming audio samples into spectrograms, EmoHRNet leverages the HRNet architecture to extract high-level features. EmoHRNet's unique architecture maintains high-resolution representations throughout, capturing both granular and overarching emotional cues from speech signals. The model outperforms leading models, achieving accuracies of 92.45% on RAVDESS, 80.06% on IEMOCAP, and 92.77% on EMOVO. Thus, we show that EmoHRNet sets a new benchmark in the SER domain.

<title>Moloch's Bargain: Emergent Misalignment When LLMs Compete for Audiences</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment. These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal trust.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models, over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday images.

<title>Non-iid hypothesis testing: from classical to quantum</title>

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing (aka state certification) in the non-identically distributed setting. A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical case, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability distributions $p_1, \dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \{1, 2, \dots, d\}$, and one wishes to accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a known hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c = 2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\mathrm{avg}},q) > \epsilon$. This nearly matches the optimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and generalizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we study the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum states. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional hypothesis state $\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state $\rho_1, \dots, \rho_T$, one can distinguish $\rho_{\mathrm{avg}} = \sigma$ from $D_{\mathrm{tr}}(\rho_{\mathrm{avg}},\sigma) > \epsilon$ provided $T \gg d/\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is surprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the classical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the non-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool we introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and more generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting.

Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning. In the average-reward setting, standard TD($\lambda$) is highly sensitive to the choice of step-size and thus requires careful tuning to maintain numerical stability. We introduce average-reward implicit TD($\lambda$), which employs an implicit fixed point update to provide data-adaptive stabilization while preserving the per iteration computational complexity of standard average-reward TD($\lambda$). In contrast to prior finite-time analyses of average-reward TD($\lambda$), which impose restrictive step-size conditions, we establish finite-time error bounds for the implicit variant under substantially weaker step-size requirements. Empirically, average-reward implicit TD($\lambda$) operates reliably over a much broader range of step-sizes and exhibits markedly improved numerical stability. This enables more efficient policy evaluation and policy learning, highlighting its effectiveness as a robust alternative to average-reward TD($\lambda$).

Abstract: Differentiable model predictive control (MPC) offers a powerful framework for combining learning and control. However, its adoption has been limited by the inherently sequential nature of traditional optimization algorithms, which are challenging to parallelize on modern computing hardware like GPUs. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck by introducing a GPU-accelerated differentiable optimization tool for MPC. This solver leverages sequential quadratic programming and a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) routine with tridiagonal preconditioning to exploit the problem's structure and enable efficient parallelization. We demonstrate substantial speedups over CPU- and GPU-based baselines, significantly improving upon state-of-the-art training times on benchmark reinforcement learning and imitation learning tasks. Finally, we showcase the method on the challenging task of reinforcement learning for driving at the limits of handling, where it enables robust drifting of a Toyota Supra through water puddles.

Abstract: In climate science, the tuning of climate models is a computationally intensive problem due to the combination of the high-dimensionality of the system state and long integration times. Here we demonstrate the potential of a parameter estimation algorithm which makes use of synchronization to tune a global atmospheric model at modest computational costs. We first use it to directly optimize internal model parameters. We then apply the algorithm to the weights of each member of a supermodel ensemble to optimize the overall predictions. In both cases, the algorithm is able to find parameters which result in reduced errors in the climatology of the model. Finally, we introduce a novel approach which combines both methods called adaptive supermodeling, where the internal parameters of the members of a supermodel are tuned simultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel predictions are optimized. For a case designed to challenge the two previous methods, adaptive supermodeling achieves a performance similar to a perfect model.

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects. BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect, developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of 24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Modulations are a critical part of sound design and music production, enabling the creation of complex and evolving audio. Modern synthesizers provide envelopes, low frequency oscillators (LFOs), and more parameter automation tools that allow users to modulate the output with ease. However, determining the modulation signals used to create a sound is difficult, and existing sound-matching / parameter estimation systems are often uninterpretable black boxes or predict high-dimensional framewise parameter values without considering the shape, structure, and routing of the underlying modulation curves. We propose a neural sound-matching approach that leverages modulation extraction, constrained control signal parameterizations, and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) to discover the modulations present in a sound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on highly modulated synthetic and real audio samples, its applicability to different DDSP synth architectures, and investigate the trade-off it incurs between interpretability and sound-matching accuracy. We make our code and audio samples available and provide the trained DDSP synths in a VST plugin.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i) reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Abstract: Renewable energy forecasting is attaining greater importance due to its constant increase in contribution to the electrical power grids. Solar energy is one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is dependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical power grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high accuracy, are needed. In the current study, Machine Learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting and Genetic Algorithm Optimization are used to forecast solar irradiation. The data used for training and validation is recorded from across three different geographical stations in the United States that are part of the SURFRAD network. A Global Horizontal Index (GHI) is predicted for the models built and compared. Genetic Algorithm Optimization is applied to XGB to further improve the accuracy of solar irradiation prediction.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of nonlinear filtering, i.e., computing the conditional distribution of the state of a stochastic dynamical system given a history of noisy partial observations. Conventional sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental limitations, in scenarios involving degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional states, due to the weight degeneracy issue. In this paper, we explore an alternative method, which is based on estimating the Brenier optimal transport (OT) map from the current prior distribution of the state to the posterior distribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters, the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover, it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that compare the OT method to the SIR particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance in terms of sample efficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to capture complex and multi-modal distributions.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have become a significant threat to the pre-training and deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although numerous methods for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks have been proposed, most rely on identifying and eliminating the ``shortcut" created by the backdoor, which links a specific source class to a target class. However, these approaches can be easily circumvented by designing multiple backdoor triggers that create shortcuts everywhere and therefore nowhere specific. In this study, we explore the concept of Multi-Trigger Backdoor Attacks (MTBAs), where multiple adversaries leverage different types of triggers to poison the same dataset. By proposing and investigating three types of multi-trigger attacks including \textit{parallel}, \textit{sequential}, and \textit{hybrid} attacks, we demonstrate that 1) multiple triggers can coexist, overwrite, or cross-activate one another, and 2) MTBAs easily break the prevalent shortcut assumption underlying most existing backdoor detection/removal methods, rendering them ineffective. Given the security risk posed by MTBAs, we have created a multi-trigger backdoor poisoning dataset to facilitate future research on detecting and mitigating these attacks, and we also discuss potential defense strategies against MTBAs. Our code is available at https://github.com/bboylyg/Multi-Trigger-Backdoor-Attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning is increasingly used in domains such as healthcare to facilitate collaborative model training without data-sharing. However, datasets located in different sites are often non-identically distributed, leading to degradation of model performance in FL. Most existing methods for assessing these distribution shifts are limited by being dataset or task-specific. Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data, a practice restricted in many FL scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric for assessing dataset similarity. Our metric exhibits several desirable properties for FL: it is dataset-agnostic, is calculated in a privacy-preserving manner, and is computationally efficient, requiring no model training. In this paper, we first establish a theoretical connection between our metric and training dynamics in FL. Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of datasets including synthetic, benchmark, and medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate that our metric shows a robust and interpretable relationship with model performance and can be calculated in privacy-preserving manner. As the first federated dataset similarity metric, we believe this metric can better facilitate successful collaborations between sites.

Abstract: Testing for individual discrimination involves deriving a profile, the comparator, similar to the one making the discrimination claim, the complainant, based on a protected attribute, such as race or gender, and comparing their decision outcomes. The complainant-comparator pair is central to discrimination testing. Most discrimination testing tools rely on this pair to establish evidence for discrimination. In this work we revisit the role of the comparator in discrimination testing. We first argue for the inherent causal modeling nature of deriving the comparator. We then introduce a two-kinds classification for the comparator: the ceteris paribus, or``with all else equal,'' (CP) comparator and the mutatis mutandis, or ``with the appropriate adjustments being made,'' (MM) comparator. The CP comparator is the standard comparator, representing an idealized comparison for establishing discrimination as it aims for a complainant-comparator pair that only differs on membership to the protected attribute. As an alternative to it, we define the MM comparator, which requires that the comparator represents the``what would have been of'' the complainant without the effects of the protected attribute on the non-protected attributes. Under the MM comparator, the complainant-comparator pair can be dissimilar in terms of the non-protected attributes, departing from an idealized comparison. Notably, the MM comparator is a more complex kind of comparator and its implementation offers an impactful venue for machine learning methods. We illustrate these two comparators and their impact on discrimination testing using a real-world example.

Abstract: Models for natural language and images benefit from data scaling behavior: the more data fed into the model, the better they perform. This 'better with more' phenomenon enables the effectiveness of large-scale pre-training on vast amounts of data. However, current graph pre-training methods struggle to scale up data due to heterogeneity across graphs. To achieve effective data scaling, we aim to develop a general model that is able to capture diverse data patterns of graphs and can be utilized to adaptively help the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UniAug, a universal graph structure augmentor built on a diffusion model. We first pre-train a discrete diffusion model on thousands of graphs across domains to learn the graph structural patterns. In the downstream phase, we provide adaptive enhancement by conducting graph structure augmentation with the help of the pre-trained diffusion model via guided generation. By leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model for structure augmentation, we consistently achieve performance improvements across various downstream tasks in a plug-and-play manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of a data-scaling graph structure augmentor on graphs across domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DA) consists of adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to perform well on an unlabeled target domain with some data distribution shift. While many methods have been proposed in the literature, fair and realistic evaluation remains an open question, particularly due to methodological difficulties in selecting hyperparameters in the unsupervised setting. With SKADA-bench, we propose a framework to evaluate DA methods on diverse modalities, beyond computer vision task that have been largely explored in the literature. We present a complete and fair evaluation of existing shallow algorithms, including reweighting, mapping, and subspace alignment. Realistic hyperparameter selection is performed with nested cross-validation and various unsupervised model selection scores, on both simulated datasets with controlled shifts and real-world datasets across diverse modalities, such as images, text, biomedical, and tabular data. Our benchmark highlights the importance of realistic validation and provides practical guidance for real-life applications, with key insights into the choice and impact of model selection approaches. SKADA-bench is open-source, reproducible, and can be easily extended with novel DA methods, datasets, and model selection criteria without requiring re-evaluating competitors. SKADA-bench is available on Github at https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada-bench.

Abstract: We present AuToMATo, a novel clustering algorithm based on persistent homology. While AuToMATo is not parameter-free per se, we provide default choices for its parameters that make it into an out-of-the-box clustering algorithm that performs well across the board. AuToMATo combines the existing ToMATo clustering algorithm with a bootstrapping procedure in order to separate significant peaks of an estimated density function from non-significant ones. We perform a thorough comparison of AuToMATo (with its parameters fixed to their defaults) against many other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We find not only that AuToMATo compares favorably against parameter-free clustering algorithms, but in many instances also significantly outperforms even the best selection of parameters for other algorithms. AuToMATo is motivated by applications in topological data analysis, in particular the Mapper algorithm, where it is desirable to work with a clustering algorithm that does not need tuning of its parameters. Indeed, we provide evidence that AuToMATo performs well when used with Mapper. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of AuToMATo in Python that is fully compatible with the standard scikit-learn architecture.

Abstract: Causal probing aims to analyze foundation models by examining how intervening on their representation of various latent properties impacts their outputs. Recent works have cast doubt on the theoretical basis of several leading causal probing methods, but it has been unclear how to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in practice. To address this, we define two key causal probing desiderata: completeness (how thoroughly the representation of the target property has been transformed) and selectivity (how little non-targeted properties have been impacted). We find that there is an inherent tradeoff between the two, which we define as reliability, their harmonic mean. We introduce an empirical analysis framework to measure and evaluate these quantities, allowing us to make the first direct comparisons between different families of leading causal probing methods (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear, or concept removal vs. counterfactual interventions). We find that: (1) all methods show a clear tradeoff between completeness and selectivity; (2) more complete and reliable methods have a greater impact on LLM behavior; and (3) nonlinear interventions are almost always more reliable than linear interventions.

Abstract: In recent years, much of the research on clustering algorithms has primarily focused on enhancing their accuracy and efficiency, frequently at the expense of interpretability. However, as these methods are increasingly being applied in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, the need for transparent and interpretable clustering outcomes has become a critical concern. This is not only necessary for gaining user trust but also for satisfying the growing ethical and regulatory demands in these fields. Ensuring that decisions derived from clustering algorithms can be clearly understood and justified is now a fundamental requirement. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured review of the current state of explainable clustering algorithms, identifying key criteria to distinguish between various methods. These insights can effectively assist researchers in making informed decisions about the most suitable explainable clustering methods for specific application contexts, while also promoting the development and adoption of clustering algorithms that are both efficient and transparent. For convenient access and reference, an open repository organizes representative and emerging interpretable clustering methods under the taxonomy proposed in this survey, available at https://github.com/hulianyu/Awesome-Interpretable-Clustering

Abstract: Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.

<title>Anchors Aweigh! Sail for Optimal Unified Multi-Modal Representations</title>

Abstract: A unified representation space in multi-modal learning is essential for effectively integrating diverse data sources, such as text, images, and audio, to enhance efficiency and performance across various downstream tasks. Recent binding methods, such as ImageBind, typically rely on a single, fixed anchor modality for aligning multi-modal data. We mathematically analyze these fixed anchor binding methods and uncover significant limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the anchor modality, (2) inadequate capture of intra-modal information, and (3) failure to account for cross-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities. To address these issues, we propose the need for adaptive anchor binding methods, exemplified by our framework CentroBind. The proposed method uses adaptively adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available modalities, leading to a balanced and rich representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach captures three critical properties of multi-modal learning -- intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multi-modal alignment -- while constructing a unified representation that spans all modalities. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that adaptive anchor methods such as CentroBind consistently outperform fixed anchor binding methods, verifying our analysis.

Abstract: There is an ongoing effort to develop feature selection algorithms to improve interpretability, reduce computational resources, and minimize overfitting in predictive models. Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We introduce EntryPrune, a novel supervised feature selection algorithm using a dense neural network with a dynamic sparse input layer. It employs entry-based pruning, a novel approach that compares neurons based on their relative change induced when they have entered the network. Extensive experiments on 13 different datasets show that our approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in particular improves the average accuracy on low-dimensional datasets. Furthermore, we show that EntryPruning surpasses traditional techniques such as magnitude pruning within the EntryPrune framework and that EntryPrune achieves lower runtime than competing approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/flxzimmer/entryprune.

<title>A Middle Path for On-Premises LLM Deployment: Preserving Privacy Without Sacrificing Model Confidentiality</title>

Abstract: Privacy-sensitive users require deploying large language models (LLMs) within their own infrastructure (on-premises) to safeguard private data and enable customization. However, vulnerabilities in local environments can lead to unauthorized access and potential model theft. To address this, prior research on small models has explored securing only the output layer within hardware-secured devices to balance model confidentiality and customization. Yet this approach fails to protect LLMs effectively. In this paper, we discover that (1) query-based distillation attacks targeting the secured top layer can produce a functionally equivalent replica of the victim model; (2) securing the same number of layers, bottom layers before a transition layer provide stronger protection against distillation attacks than top layers, with comparable effects on customization performance; and (3) the number of secured layers creates a trade-off between protection and customization flexibility. Based on these insights, we propose SOLID, a novel deployment framework that secures a few bottom layers in a secure environment and introduces an efficient metric to optimize the trade-off by determining the ideal number of hidden layers. Extensive experiments on five models (1.3B to 70B parameters) demonstrate that SOLID outperforms baselines, achieving a better balance between protection and downstream customization.

Abstract: Evaluation insights are limited by the availability of high-quality benchmarks. As models evolve, there is a need to create benchmarks that can measure progress on new and complex generative capabilities. However, manually creating new benchmarks is slow and expensive, restricting comprehensive evaluations for any capability. We introduce BenchAgents, a multi-agent framework that methodically leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate evaluation benchmark creation while inherently ensuring data and (evaluation) metric quality. BenchAgents decomposes the benchmark creation process into planning, generation, verification, and evaluation, each of which is ] orchestrated via LLM agents. These agents interact with each other and utilize feedback from benchmark developers to improve and flexibly control data diversity and quality. We use BenchAgents to create benchmarks to evaluate capabilities related to planning, constraint satisfaction, and causal reasoning spanning both language and vision modalities. We then use these benchmarks to study state-of-the-art models and extract new insights into common failure modes and model differences.

<title>DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Saiful185/DUA-D2C.

<title>Can foundation models actively gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses?</title>

Abstract: Foundation models excel at single-turn reasoning but struggle with multi-turn exploration in dynamic environments, a requirement for many real-world challenges. We evaluated these models on their ability to learn from experience, adapt, and gather information. First, in "Feature World," a simple setting for testing information gathering, models performed near-optimally. However, to test more complex, multi-trial learning, we implemented a text-based version of the "Alchemy" environment, a benchmark for meta-learning. Here, agents must deduce a latent causal structure by integrating information across many trials. In this setting, recent foundation models initially failed to improve their performance over time. Crucially, we found that prompting the models to summarize their observations at regular intervals enabled an emergent meta-learning process. This allowed them to improve across trials and even adaptively re-learn when the environment's rules changed unexpectedly. While most models handled the simple task, Alchemy revealed stark differences in robustness: Gemini 2.5 performed best, followed by Claude 3.7, while ChatGPT-4o and o4-mini struggled. This underscores Alchemy's value as a benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that the biggest challenge for foundation models is not selecting informative actions in the moment, but integrating knowledge through adaptive strategies over time. Encouragingly, there appears to be no intrinsic barrier to future models mastering these abilities.

Abstract: The field of mechanistic interpretability in pre-trained transformer models has demonstrated substantial evidence supporting the ''linear representation hypothesis'', which is the idea that high level concepts are encoded as vectors in the space of activations of a model. Studies also show that model generation behavior can be steered toward a given concept by adding the concept's vector to the corresponding activations. We show how to leverage these properties to build a form of logical implication into models, enabling transparent and interpretable adjustments that induce a chosen generation behavior in response to the presence of any given concept. Our method, Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS), unlocks new hand engineered reasoning capabilities by integrating neuro-symbolic logic into pre-trained transformer models.

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, but these models are typically adapted from image generation frameworks and overlook inherent higher-order topology, leaving them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff), a principled framework that progressively generates plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. HOG-Diff follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum guided by higher-order topology and implemented via diffusion bridges. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.

Abstract: Scaling laws are typically fit using a family of models with a narrow range of frozen hyperparameter choices. In this work we study scaling laws using multiple architectural shapes and hyperparameter choices, highlighting their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of our research, we release the Gemstones: an open-source scaling law dataset, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters and diverse architectural shapes; including ablations over learning rate and cooldown. Our checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as analyzing the relationship between width and depth. By examining our model suite, we find that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.

Abstract: As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.

Abstract: We present significant extensions to diffusion-based sequence generation models, blurring the line with autoregressive language models. We introduce hyperschedules, which assign distinct noise schedules to individual token positions, generalizing both autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) and conventional diffusion models (e.g., SEDD, MDLM) as special cases. Second, we propose two hybrid token-wise noising processes that interpolate between absorbing and uniform processes, enabling the model to fix past mistakes, and we introduce a novel inference algorithm that leverages this new feature in a simplified context inspired from MDLM. To support efficient training and inference, we design attention masks compatible with KV-caching. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art perplexity and generate diverse, high-quality sequences across standard benchmarks, suggesting a promising path for autoregressive diffusion-based sequence generation.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as the next major frontier for language models (LMs), with rapid advances from both academic and industrial labs. However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices--including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software configurations. Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards. Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements--far below prior claims--and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME'24. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization in the settings we study. To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have recently become more prominent, serving as a core element in safety-critical autonomous systems. One major purpose of OOD detection is to reject invalid inputs that could lead to unpredictable errors and compromise safety. Due to the cost of labeled data, recent works have investigated the feasibility of self-supervised learning (SSL) OOD detection, unlabeled OOD detection, and zero shot OOD detection. In this work, we identify a set of conditions for a theoretical guarantee of failure in unlabeled OOD detection algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective. These conditions are present in all OOD tasks dealing with real-world data: I) we provide theoretical proof of unlabeled OOD detection failure when there exists zero mutual information between the learning objective and the in-distribution labels, a.k.a. 'label blindness', II) we define a new OOD task - Adjacent OOD detection - that tests for label blindness and accounts for a previously ignored safety gap in all OOD detection benchmarks, and III) we perform experiments demonstrating that existing unlabeled OOD methods fail under conditions suggested by our label blindness theory and analyze the implications for future research in unlabeled OOD methods.

Abstract: Inference scaling helps LLMs solve complex reasoning problems through extended runtime computation. On top of long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models, purely inference-time techniques such as best-of-N (BoN) sampling, majority voting, or more generally, minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBRD), can further improve LLM accuracy by generating multiple candidate solutions and aggregating over them. These methods typically leverage additional signals in the form of reward models and risk/similarity functions that compare generated samples, e.g., exact match in some normalized space or standard similarity metrics such as Rouge. Here we present a novel method for incorporating reward and risk/similarity signals into MBRD. Based on the concept of optimal policy in KL-controlled reinforcement learning, our framework provides a simple and well-defined mechanism for leveraging such signals, offering several advantages over traditional inference-time methods: higher robustness, improved accuracy, and well-understood asymptotic behavior. In addition, it allows for the development of a sample-efficient variant of MBRD that can adjust the number of samples to generate according to the difficulty of the problem, without relying on majority vote counts. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach on math (MATH-$500$) and coding (HumanEval) tasks using recent open-source models. We also present a comprehensive analysis of its accuracy-compute trade-offs.

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Trustworthy verifiers are essential for the success of reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR), which is the core methodology behind various large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1. In complex domains like mathematical reasoning, rule-based verifiers have been widely adopted in previous works to train strong reasoning models. However, the reliability of these verifiers and their impact on the RL training process remain poorly understood. In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and conduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation and RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based verifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different formats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in non-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL training performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets stronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential solution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that model-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy, further analysis and RL results imply that they are highly susceptible to hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct, particularly after fine-tuning. This vulnerability is exploited during policy model optimization, leading to artificially inflated rewards. Our findings underscore the unique challenges inherent to both rule-based and model-based verifiers and provide insights toward developing more accurate and robust reward systems for reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia associated with elevated health risks, where timely detection is pivotal for mitigating stroke-related morbidity. This study introduces an innovative hybrid methodology integrating unsupervised deep learning and gradient boosting models to improve AF detection. A 19-layer deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is coupled with three boosting classifiers-AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM (LGBM)-to harness their complementary advantages while addressing individual limitations. The proposed framework uniquely combines DCAE with gradient boosting, enabling end-to-end AF identification devoid of manual feature extraction. The DCAE-LGBM model attains an F1-score of 95.20%, sensitivity of 99.99%, and inference latency of four seconds, outperforming existing methods and aligning with clinical deployment requirements. The DCAE integration significantly enhances boosting models, positioning this hybrid system as a reliable tool for automated AF detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models, boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings. The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD, accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values, encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of representation quality.

<title>Generalizing Supervised Contrastive learning: A Projection Perspective</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However, supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods. Extensive experiments on image and audio datasets demonstrate that ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary perspectives--information-theoretic and projection viewpoints--and offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the foundational contrastive objective.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two instantiation--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes "emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment, we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior. Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples efficiently restores alignment.

<title>Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting</title>

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB in challenging MTL environments.

<title>CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Generative Credit Assignment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning agents with human feedback is crucial when task objectives are difficult to specify through dense reward functions. While prior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human preferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents must adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time scalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued learning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is often noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of learned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time scalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for continual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal inconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering ambiguous feedback. Pref-GUIDE Voting further enhances robustness by aggregating reward models across a population of users to form consensus preferences. Across three challenging environments, Pref-GUIDE significantly outperforms scalar-feedback baselines, with the voting variant exceeding even expert-designed dense rewards. By reframing scalar feedback as structured preferences with population feedback, Pref-GUIDE offers a scalable and principled approach for harnessing human input in online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS, for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6 state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance, less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why, on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to classification or retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors (EKNN) classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The results demonstrate that the proposed classifier outperforms the best existing evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.86%, while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Guardian models play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and ethical behavior of user-facing AI applications by enforcing guardrails and detecting harmful content. While standard guardian models are limited to predefined, static harm categories, we introduce DynaGuard, a suite of dynamic guardian models offering novel flexibility by evaluating text based on user-defined policies, and DynaBench, a dataset for training and evaluating dynamic guardian models. Our models provide both rapid detection of policy violations and a chain-of-thought reasoning option that articulate and justify model outputs. Critically, DynaGuard not only surpasses static models in detection accuracy on traditional safety categories, but is competitive with frontier reasoning models on free-form policy violations, all in a fraction of the time. This makes DynaGuard an critical tool for language model guardrails.

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI, and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8 tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best-performing baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/killian31/SPCARobustness.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e., bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit. It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries, such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper, we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where product utilities are non-additive.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) was developed to provide finite-sample probabilistic prediction guarantees. While CP algorithms are a relatively general-purpose approach to uncertainty quantification, with finite-sample guarantees, they lack versatility. Namely, the CP approach does not {\em prescribe} how to quantify the degree to which a data set provides evidence in support of (or against) an arbitrary event from a general class of events. In this paper, tools are offered from imprecise probability theory to build a formal connection between CP and generalized fiducial (GF) inference. These new insights establish a more general inferential lens from which CP can be understood, and demonstrate the pragmatism of fiducial ideas. The formal connection establishes a context in which epistemically-derived GF probability matches aleatoric/frequentist probability. Beyond this fact, it is illustrated how tools from imprecise probability theory, namely lower and upper probability functions, can be applied in the context of the imprecise GF distribution to provide posterior-like, prescriptive inference that is not possible within the CP framework alone. In addition to the primary CP generalization that is contributed, fundamental connections are synthesized between this new model-free GF and three other areas of contemporary research: nonparametric predictive inference (NPI), conformal predictive systems/distributions, and inferential models (IMs).

Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes two new policy learning methods: regularized policy gradient (RPG) and iterative policy optimization (IPO), for a class of discounted linear-quadratic control (LQC) problems over an infinite time horizon with entropy regularization. Assuming access to the exact policy evaluation, both proposed approaches are proven to converge linearly in finding optimal policies of the regularized LQC. Moreover, the IPO method can achieve a super-linear convergence rate once it enters a local region around the optimal policy. Finally, when the optimal policy for an RL problem with a known environment is appropriately transferred as the initial policy to an RL problem with an unknown environment, the IPO method is shown to enable a super-linear convergence rate if the two environments are sufficiently close. Performances of these proposed algorithms are supported by numerical examples.

Abstract: The emergence of prompting as the dominant paradigm for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a proliferation of LLM-native software, where application behavior arises from complex, stochastic data transformations. However, the engineering of such systems remains largely exploratory and ad-hoc, hampered by the absence of conceptual frameworks, ex-ante methodologies, design guidelines, and specialized benchmarks. We argue that a foundational step towards a more disciplined engineering practice is a systematic understanding of the core functional units--generative transformations--and their compositional patterns within LLM-native applications.
  Focusing on the rich domain of software verification and falsification, we conduct a secondary study of over 100 research proposals to address this gap. We first present a fine-grained taxonomy of generative transformations, abstracting prompt-based interactions into conceptual signatures. This taxonomy serves as a scaffolding to identify recurrent transformation relationship patterns--analogous to software design patterns--that characterize solution approaches in the literature. Our analysis not only validates the utility of the taxonomy but also surfaces strategic gaps and cross-dimensional relationships, offering a structured foundation for future research in modular and compositional LLM application design, benchmarking, and the development of reliable LLM-native systems.

Abstract: We propose a deep mixture of multimodal hierarchical variational auto-encoders called MMHVAE that synthesizes missing images from observed images in different modalities. MMHVAE's design focuses on tackling four challenges: (i) creating a complex latent representation of multimodal data to generate high-resolution images; (ii) encouraging the variational distributions to estimate the missing information needed for cross-modal image synthesis; (iii) learning to fuse multimodal information in the context of missing data; (iv) leveraging dataset-level information to handle incomplete data sets at training time. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of pre-operative brain multi-parametric magnetic resonance and intra-operative ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Bangla is a language spoken by approximately 240 million native speakers and around 300 million people worldwide. Despite being the 5th largest spoken language in the world, Bangla is still a "low-resource" language, and existing pretrained language models often struggle to perform well on Bangla Language Processing (BLP) tasks. This paper addresses this gap by: (1) introducing two high-quality translated Bangla-instruction datasets totaling 224k samples - Bangla-Orca (172k) and Bangla-Alpaca (52k); and (2) leveraging these datasets to develop BanglaLlama, an open-source family of Bangla-specific LLMs, consisting of five base and instruct variants. We present our methodology, two large datasets, and comprehensive benchmarking results showcasing the effectiveness of our dataset and model on multiple benchmarks. We believe our proposed datasets and models will serve as the new standard baseline for future research focused on this widely spoken yet "low-resource" language.

Abstract: Physics based numerical climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for longer roll-out climate emulation task. Here, we propose PACER, a relatively lightweight 2.1M parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate EmulatoR. PACER is trained across is trained across varying spatial resolutions and physics based climate models, enabling faithful and stable emulation of temperature fields at multiple surface levels over a 10 year horizon. We propose an auto-regressive ODE-SDE framework for climate emulation that integrates the fundamental physical law of advection, while being trained under a negative log-likelihood objective to enable principled uncertainty quantification of stochastic variability. We show PACER's emulation performance across 20 climate models outperforming relevant baselines and advancing towards explicit physics infusion in ML emulator.

Abstract: Decision trees are a popular machine learning method, known for their inherent explainability. In Explainable AI, decision trees can be used as surrogate models for complex black box AI models or as approximations of parts of such models. A key challenge of this approach is determining how accurately the extracted decision tree represents the original model and to what extent it can be trusted as an approximation of their behavior. In this work, we investigate the use of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to provide a theoretical guarantee of fidelity for decision trees extracted from AI models. Based on theoretical results from the PAC framework, we adapt a decision tree algorithm to ensure a PAC guarantee under certain conditions. We focus on binary classification and conduct experiments where we extract decision trees from BERT-based language models with PAC guarantees. Our results indicate occupational gender bias in these models.

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to generate new data samples that resemble a given dataset, with diffusion models recently becoming the most popular generative model. One of the main challenges of diffusion models is solving the problem in the input space, which tends to be very high-dimensional. Recently, solving diffusion models in the latent space through an encoder that maps from the data space to a lower-dimensional latent space has been considered to make the training process more efficient and has shown state-of-the-art results. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is the most commonly used encoder/decoder framework in this domain, known for its ability to learn latent representations and generate data samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoder/decoder framework with theoretical properties distinct from those of the VAE, specifically designed to preserve the geometric structure of the data distribution. We demonstrate the significant advantages of this geometry-preserving encoder in the training process of both the encoder and decoder. Additionally, we provide theoretical results proving convergence of the training process, including convergence guarantees for encoder training, and results showing faster convergence of decoder training when using the geometry-preserving encoder.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a widely used framework for constructing valid prediction sets in classification and regression tasks. In this work, we extend the split conformal prediction framework to hierarchical classification, where prediction sets are commonly restricted to internal nodes of a predefined hierarchy, and propose two computationally efficient inference algorithms. The first algorithm returns internal nodes as prediction sets, while the second one relaxes this restriction. Using the notion of representation complexity, the latter yields smaller set sizes at the cost of a more general and combinatorial inference problem. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in achieving nominal coverage.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis and machine learning, used to group similar data points together. Among various clustering methods, the Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) is one of the most widely used. MSSC aims to minimize the total squared Euclidean distance between data points and their corresponding cluster centroids. Due to the unsupervised nature of clustering, achieving global optimality is crucial, yet computationally challenging. The complexity of finding the global solution increases exponentially with the number of data points, making exact methods impractical for large-scale datasets. Even obtaining strong lower bounds on the optimal MSSC objective value is computationally prohibitive, making it difficult to assess the quality of heuristic solutions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel method to validate heuristic MSSC solutions through optimality gaps. Our approach employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the problem into smaller instances that can be handled by an exact solver. The decomposition is guided by an auxiliary optimization problem, the "anticlustering problem", for which we design an efficient heuristic. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for large-scale instances, achieving optimality gaps below 3% in most cases while maintaining reasonable computational times. These results highlight the practicality of our approach in assessing feasible clustering solutions for large datasets, bridging a critical gap in MSSC evaluation.

<title>A Generative Approach to LLM Harmfulness Mitigation with Red Flag Tokens</title>

arXiv:2502.16366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many safety post-training methods for large language models (LLMs) are designed to modify the model's behaviour from producing unsafe answers to issuing refusals. However, such distribution shifts are often brittle and degrade performance on desirable tasks. To address these pitfalls, we propose augmenting the model's vocabulary with a special red flag token, and training the model to insert this token whenever harmful content is generated or imminent. This approach enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness in its representations, with minimal impact on utility due to the marginal change in the generated distribution of natural language. Moreover, because the token is embedded in the model's vocabulary, we can naturally leverage the LLMs' generalization capabilities, such as in-context learning (ICL) and out-of-distribution generalization to languages that are not formally supported (e.g., Japanese for Llama3). In particular, we demonstrate that through ICL alone, the model can learn to initiate reflective reasoning upon generating the red flag token at inference, which steers the response away from harmful continuations or enables self-correction when the flag is raised falsely. This approach is orthogonal and complementary to existing safety technique (such as safety classifiers or standard safety training) and easier to evaluate in comparison to natural language refusals, as it does not require a human or automated judge to assess the harmlessness of the answers.

Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials science, enabling the discovery of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate novel and stable crystal structures without additional fine-tuning. Our framework employs LLMs as intelligent proposal agents within an evolutionary pipeline that guides them to perform implicit crossover and mutation operations while maintaining chemical validity. We demonstrate that MatLLMSearch achieves a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework adapts to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish our framework as a versatile and effective framework for consistent high-quality materials discovery, offering training-free generation of novel stable structures with reduced overhead and broader accessibility.

<title>Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects</title>

arXiv:2503.01722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Motion planning involves determining a sequence of robot configurations to reach a desired pose, subject to movement and safety constraints. Traditional motion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in clutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without contact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g. brushing a soft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g. toppling a glass vase), making it difficult to characterize which may be acceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment semantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact based on object properties and locations. Our approach generates an anisotropic cost map that encodes directional push safety. We pair this map with a contact-aware A* planner to find stable contact-rich paths. We perform experiments using 20 simulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object displacements, and feedback from human evaluators. Our results over 3200 simulation and 200 real-world trials suggest that IMPACT enables efficient contact-rich motion planning in cluttered settings while outperforming alternative methods and ablations.

<title>Optimal Transport for Brain-Image Alignment: Unveiling Redundancy and Synergy in Neural Information Processing</title>

arXiv:2503.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with stimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local point-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/OT-Alignment4brain-to-image.

Abstract: The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.

arXiv:2503.20722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values and Total Diffusion Volume (TDV) from Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) are recognized cancer imaging biomarkers. However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using "soft labels" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score of 0.67 for whole skeletal delineation, 0.76 when excluding ribcage, 0.83 for internal organs, and 0.86 for spinal canal, with average surface distances below 3mm. Relative median ADC differences between automated and manual full-body delineations were below 10%. The model was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 sec vs. 5 min). Two experienced radiologists rated the model's outputs as either "good" or "excellent" on test scans, with inter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72). Conclusion: The model offers fast, reproducible probability maps for localising and delineating body regions on WB-DWI, potentially enabling non-invasive imaging biomarker quantification to support disease staging and treatment response assessment.

Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.

Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.

Abstract: This is the preprint version of the article published in IEEE Access vol. 13, pp. 146503--146526, 2025, doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3599541. Please cite the published version.
  Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy.

Abstract: Matrix factorization mechanisms for differentially private training have emerged as a promising approach to improve model utility under privacy constraints. In practical settings, models are typically trained over multiple epochs, requiring matrix factorizations that account for repeated participation. Existing theoretical upper and lower bounds on multi-epoch factorization error leave a significant gap. In this work, we introduce a new explicit factorization method, Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR), which imposes a banded structure on the inverse correlation matrix. This factorization enables us to derive an explicit and tight characterization of the multi-epoch error. We further prove that BISR achieves asymptotically optimal error by matching the upper and lower bounds. Empirically, BISR performs on par with state-of-the-art factorization methods, while being simpler to implement, computationally efficient, and easier to analyze.

<title>SAE-FiRE: Enhancing Earnings Surprise Predictions Through Sparse Autoencoder Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises from financial documents, such as earnings conference calls, regulatory filings, and financial news, has become increasingly important in financial economics. However, these financial documents present significant analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for language models. In this work, we propose the SAE-FiRE (Sparse Autoencoder for Financial Representation Enhancement) framework to address these limitations by extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose dense neural representations from large language models into interpretable sparse components, then applies statistical feature selection methods, including ANOVA F-tests and tree-based importance scoring, to identify the top-k most discriminative dimensions for classification. By systematically filtering out noise that might otherwise lead to overfitting, we enable more robust and generalizable predictions. Experimental results across three financial datasets demonstrate that SAE-FiRE significantly outperforms baseline approaches.

<title>An Embarrassingly Simple Defense Against LLM Abliteration Attacks</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to refuse harmful instructions through safety fine-tuning. A recent attack, termed abliteration, identifies and suppresses the single latent direction most responsible for refusal behavior, thereby enabling models to generate harmful content. We propose a defense that fundamentally alters how models express refusal. We construct an extended-refusal dataset in which responses to harmful prompts provide detailed justifications before refusing, distributing the refusal signal across multiple token positions. Fine-tuning Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on this dataset yields models that maintain high refusal rates under abliteration: refusal rates drop by at most 10%, compared to 70-80% drops in baseline models. Comprehensive evaluations of safety and utility demonstrate that extended-refusal fine-tuning effectively neutralizes abliteration attacks while preserving general model performance and enhancing robustness across multiple alignment scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: Public opinion manipulation has entered a new phase, amplifying its roots in rhetoric and propaganda. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents now let influence campaigns reach unprecedented scale and precision. Researchers warn AI could foster mass manipulation. Generative tools can expand propaganda output without sacrificing credibility and inexpensively create election falsehoods that are rated as more human-like than those written by humans. Techniques meant to refine AI reasoning, such as chain-of-thought prompting, can just as effectively be used to generate more convincing falsehoods. Enabled by these capabilities, another disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents. Fusing LLM reasoning with multi-agent architectures, these systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities, and fabricating consensus cheaply. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and lead to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. Combined with Reinforcement Learning techniques, they have the potential to be conduct as well physical-layer security hardening. Yet, and in addition to security improvements, it is crucial to consider the concept of fair communication. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces must ensure that User Equipment units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other units being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining both an efficient and fair duplex Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Reinforcement Learning system for multiple legitimate User Equipment units without reducing the level of achieved physical-layer security hardening. In terms of contributions, we uncover a fairness imbalance of a previous physical-layer security hardening solution, validate our findings and report experimental work via simulation results. We also provide an alternative reward strategy to solve the uncovered problems and release both code and datasets to foster further research in the topics of this paper.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from dynamical systems is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. Conditional local independence, which describes whether the evolution of one process is influenced by another process given additional processes, is important for causal learning in such systems. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis test for conditional local independence in It\^o processes. Our test is grounded in the semimartingale decomposition of the It\^o process, with which we introduce a stochastic integral process that is a martingale under the null hypothesis. We then apply a test for the martingale property, quantifying potential deviation from local independence. The test statistics is estimated using the optimal filtering equation. We show the consistency of the estimation, thereby establishing the level and power of our test. Numerical verification and a real-world application to causal discovery in brain resting-state fMRIs are conducted.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets at https://zacravichandran.github.io/PRISM.

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to 8%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Abstract: We propose a step-by-step video-to-audio (V2A) generation method for finer controllability over the generation process and more realistic audio synthesis. Inspired by traditional Foley workflows, our approach aims to comprehensively capture all sound events induced by a video through the incremental generation of missing sound events. To avoid the need for costly multi-reference video-audio datasets, each generation step is formulated as a negatively guided V2A process that discourages duplication of existing sounds. The guidance model is trained by finetuning a pre-trained V2A model on audio pairs from adjacent segments of the same video, allowing training with standard single-reference audiovisual datasets that are easily accessible. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances the separability of generated sounds at each step and improves the overall quality of the final composite audio, outperforming existing baselines.

<title>Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models</title>

arXiv:2507.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health, economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models, enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards.

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations, and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table corpora with \emph{synthesized intents}, and apply it to create a dataset for studying schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference schemas. We start by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods, including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller, open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art prompted LLMs. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema refinement techniques and show that these can further improve schemas generated by these methods.

Abstract: The drive for personalization in recommender systems creates a tension between user privacy and the risk of "filter bubbles". Although federated learning offers a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving recommendations, its impact on diversity remains unclear. We introduce FedFlex, a two-stage framework that combines local, on-device fine-tuning of matrix factorization models (SVD and BPR) with a lightweight Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) re-ranking step to promote diversity. We conducted the first live user study of a federated recommender, collecting behavioral data and feedback during a two-week online deployment. Our results show that FedFlex successfully engages users, with BPR outperforming SVD in click-through rate. Re-ranking with MMR consistently improved ranking quality (nDCG) across both models, with statistically significant gains, particularly for BPR. Diversity effects varied: MMR increased coverage for both models and improved intra-list diversity for BPR, but slightly reduced it for SVD, suggesting different interactions between personalization and diversification across models. Our exit questionnaire responses indicated that most users expressed no clear preference between re-ranked and unprocessed lists, implying that increased diversity did not substantially reduce user satisfaction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/xyzhu123/Synthetic_Textbook.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total x, y, and z magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables, created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation, and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based evaluation.

Abstract: The SAFE Challenge evaluates synthetic speech detection across three tasks: unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised learning (SSL) front-ends, training data compositions, and audio length configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a multilingual dataset of 256,600 samples spanning 9 languages and over 70 TTS systems from CodecFake, MLAAD v5, SpoofCeleb, Famous Figures, and MAILABS. Through extensive experimentation with different SSL front-ends, three training data versions, and two audio lengths, we achieved second place in both Task 1 (unmodified audio detection) and Task 3 (laundered audio detection), demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models is rapidly increasing the volume of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. While the causes of model collapse are increasingly understood, effective mitigation strategies remain scarce. We address this challenge by leveraging a key insight: auto-regressive models tend to generate text sequences to which they assign high confidence (i.e., high log-likelihood). Based on this observation, we introduce the Truncated-Cross-Entropy (TCE) loss function. TCE mitigates collapse by selectively ignoring high-confidence tokens during training, effectively filtering out likely machine-generated artifacts from the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with TCE not only learn effectively but also exhibit significantly increased resilience, tolerating over 2.3x more synthetic data before the onset of collapse. In addition, we provide an open-source benchmark for collapse dynamics in mixed-data settings. Our results demonstrate that confidence-aware training objectives can substantially delay collapse onset, offering a practical and generalizable tool for model robustness under synthetic-data exposure.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, pose a growing threat to information integrity, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. This challenge is amplified by the increasing realism of modern generative models, which our human perception study confirms are often indistinguishable from real images. Yet, existing deepfake detection benchmarks rely on outdated generators or narrowly scoped datasets (e.g., single-face imagery), limiting their utility for real-world detection. To address these gaps, we present OpenFake, a large politically grounded dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking against modern generative models with high realism, and designed to remain extensible through an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform that continually integrates new hard examples. OpenFake comprises nearly four million total images: three million real images paired with descriptive captions and almost one million synthetic counterparts from state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Detectors trained on OpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong generalization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild social media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually updated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective in real-world settings.

Abstract: Part I of this work [Gao25] establishes online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online convex optimization to adapt stepsizes in gradient methods. This paper focuses on the practical aspects of OSGM. We leverage the OSGM framework to design new adaptive first-order methods and provide insights into their empirical behavior. The resulting method, OSGM-Best, matches the performance of quasi-Newton variants while requiring less memory and cheaper iterations. We also extend OSGM to nonconvex optimization and outline directions that connect OSGM to existing branches of optimization theory and practice.

Abstract: Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.

Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.

<title>ImageNet-trained CNNs are not biased towards texture: Revisiting feature reliance through controlled suppression</title>

arXiv:2509.20234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

<title>Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models</title>

arXiv:2509.22284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and 91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential, autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et. al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation. In this work, we review this class of models, examine key design choices, test alternative variants and clarify common misconceptions.

arXiv:2510.00359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network approaches that parameterize value functions have succeeded in approximating high-dimensional optimal feedback controllers when the Hamiltonian admits explicit formulas. However, many practical problems, such as the space shuttle reentry problem and bicycle dynamics, among others, may involve implicit Hamiltonians that do not admit explicit formulas, limiting the applicability of existing methods. Rather than directly parameterizing controls, which does not leverage the Hamiltonian's underlying structure, we propose an end-to-end implicit deep learning approach that directly parameterizes the value function to learn optimal control laws. Our method enforces physical principles by ensuring trained networks adhere to the control laws by exploiting the fundamental relationship between the optimal control and the value function's gradient; this is a direct consequence of the connection between Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and dynamic programming. Using Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB), we achieve efficient training despite temporal coupling in trajectory optimization. We show that JFB produces descent directions for the optimal control objective and experimentally demonstrate that our approach effectively learns high-dimensional feedback controllers across multiple scenarios involving implicit Hamiltonians, which existing methods cannot address.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains, representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings. We further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning representations for formal languages.

Summary: 
Token-level detection of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring trust. While previous approaches focused on response or span-level detection, recent work has delved into token-level detection for more precise intervention. In this study, using token-level annotations from the RAGTruth corpus, researchers discovered that the first hallucinated token is significantly more detectable than subsequent ones. This characteristic is consistent across different models, indicating the importance of identifying the first hallucination token in token-level hallucination detection. The findings provide insights into the distribution of hallucination signals across sequences of hallucinated tokens in LLMs. By leveraging this structural property, researchers can improve the accuracy of detecting and addressing hallucination in LLMs. The code used in this study is available at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Summary:
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective in generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by modeling entire trajectory distributions. However, existing GFlowNets struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions, leading to overexploration. To address this challenge, this work integrates an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process. The MCTS-based policy evaluation guides generation towards high-reward trajectories, while the Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. A controllable mechanism regulates the level of greediness, maintaining diversity while enhancing exploitation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method accelerates the discovery of high-reward regions and consistently generates high-reward samples.

arXiv:2510.00805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples, particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore, improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at https://github.com/ZRNB/MG2FlowNet.

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost. Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Summary: <br />
Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is crucial for understanding the RF environment, supporting wireless diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. Diffusion^2, a diffusion-based approach, uses 3D point clouds to model RF signal propagation across various frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves. The RF-3D Encoder captures RF-related features from 3D data, incorporating signal-specific details and 3D geometry complexities. Multi-scale embedding is applied to simulate the RF signal dissemination process accurately. The evaluation based on synthetic and real-world measurements shows that Diffusion^2 accurately estimates RF signal behavior with a minimal error margin of 1.9 dB and is 27 times faster than existing methods. This advancement in the field of RF signal modeling provides insights into RF signal propagation in diverse environmental conditions and frequency bands.

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum, lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves. To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process.

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.

<div> Keywords: Low-Resource Audio Codec, Neural Speech Codecs, Transparency Codecs, Enhancement Codecs, Convolutional Neural Networks

Summary:
The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge focuses on advancing neural audio coding for resource-constrained environments. The challenge includes two tracks - transparency codecs that preserve input speech quality under noise and reverberation, and enhancement codecs combining coding with denoising. The baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC Challenge are convolutional neural codec models with Residual Vector Quantization. These models are trained using adversarial and reconstruction objectives, with detailed strategies for data filtering and augmentation, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint selection. The challenge's goal is to develop reliable neural speech codecs that meet strict constraints on computational complexity, latency, and bitrate, while operating effectively in real-world noise and reverberation conditions. The baseline systems provide a starting point for participants to further improve upon in the LRAC Challenge.

Abstract: The Low-Resource Audio Codec (LRAC) Challenge aims to advance neural audio coding for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The first edition focuses on low-resource neural speech codecs that must operate reliably under everyday noise and reverberation, while satisfying strict constraints on computational complexity, latency, and bitrate. Track 1 targets transparency codecs, which aim to preserve the perceptual transparency of input speech under mild noise and reverberation. Track 2 addresses enhancement codecs, which combine coding and compression with denoising and dereverberation. This paper presents the official baseline systems for both tracks in the 2025 LRAC Challenge. The baselines are convolutional neural codec models with Residual Vector Quantization, trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and reconstruction objectives. We detail the data filtering and augmentation strategies, model architectures, optimization procedures, and checkpoint selection criteria.

This study focuses on constrained nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems with complex inner maximization constraints, assuming a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz condition for the inner problem. It shows that the maximal function of the original problem exhibits local H\"older smoothness.

Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.

Summary:
The study investigates the impact of padding tokens on the performance of large language models (LLMs). It is found that even small amounts of padding can lead to shifts in hidden representations. In smaller models, the use of padding tokens can degrade generation quality and alter bias in unpredictable ways. The presence of padding tokens also weakens safety guardrails, indicating a potential risk to model robustness. These findings highlight the importance of careful handling of padding tokens in LLM deployment to mitigate potential negative consequences on model performance and reliability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces Noise Generation GAN (NGGAN) to capture characteristics of impulsive noise in narrowband powerline communications. A realistic dataset is created by measuring noise from NB-PLC systems using analog coupling and bandpass filtering. NNGAN is trained with input signal lengths suitable for cyclostationary noise generation, using Wasserstein distance as a loss function for similarity enhancement. The model is evaluated against mathematical and practical datasets through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results show NGGAN closely matches real noise samples, outperforming other GAN-based models in fidelity and diversity. Principal Component Analysis scatter plots and Fréchet Inception Distance analysis confirm the superior performance of NGGAN in generating realistic noise samples. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.

Summary: 
An automated defect detection system using digital camera optics and deep learning is proposed for the dual in-line package (DIP) common in industries. The system targets surface and pin-leg defects, utilizing the ConSinGAN for generating a dataset due to the lack of defective component images. YOLO models (v3, v4, v7, v9) are tested, with YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN showing superior accuracy (95.50%) and detection time (285 ms) compared to threshold-based methods. A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed for easy establishment of the automated defect detection system across various defect types or limited defect data. <div>

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Summary:
Triplet loss and contrastive loss are compared in deep metric learning. Triplet loss shows better preservation of variance within and across classes, enabling finer distinctions. Contrastive loss compact embeddings within classes, potentially masking semantic differences. Triplet loss produces fewer but stronger updates, focusing on hard examples. Across various datasets, triplet loss outperforms contrastive loss in classification and retrieval tasks. Triplet loss is recommended for detail retention and hard-sample focus, while contrastive loss is suitable for broader embedding refinement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses, focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g., greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196 datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding refinement.

Summary: <br />
Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix play a crucial role in quantum information science. This paper explores various quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, including those derived from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies using the method of divided differences. The log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy yields the Kubo-Mori information matrix, while the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. These information matrices satisfy the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha", despite the original quantities not doing so. Additionally, $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies are derived, with formulas established for parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating these matrices are provided, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning. <div>

Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at https://VidGuard-R1.github.io.

Integrated into vLLM, PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions, predicting task ordering based on response length to reduce latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across LLMs and real-world datasets demonstrate PARS's performance improvements, even for reasoning workloads.

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when predictors are trained on different LLMs.

Summary:
The article introduces the VIFO model, a cross-modal forecasting approach that leverages pre-trained large vision models to extract complex patterns from multivariate time series data. VIFO converts time series data into images, allowing the pre-trained model to recognize cross-channel dependencies that are often overlooked in traditional models. By freezing most of the parameters of the large vision model and training only a small percentage, VIFO achieves competitive forecasting performance on various benchmarks. This approach effectively combines information from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting accuracy and efficiency. VIFO offers an innovative solution for capturing cross-variable relationships in time series data and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in the field of forecasting. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing cross-variable relationships in

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge. To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches. Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high- and low-frequency components in explainability.

<div> Keywords: Pruning, Language Models, Structured Sparsity, ADMM, Memory Efficiency

Summary:
Structured pruning is essential for efficiently scaling large language models (LLMs). Traditional global pruning requires excessive memory, while local pruning neglects inter-layer dependencies. The proposed STRUPRUNE framework combines the benefits of structured and local pruning by decomposing the global pruning problem into manageable subproblems. It utilizes an ADMM-based approach to integrate structured sparsity into the pruning process, achieving a memory efficiency of O(√N) for billion-parameter models. STRUPRUNE's closed-form analytical solution provides layer-wise sparsity allocation rules, and an energy-based framework adapts to varying layer importance. Experimental results show that STRUPRUNE matches the performance of global structured pruning while significantly reducing memory costs, making it suitable for practical deployment at a large scale. <div>

Abstract: Pruning is critical for scaling large language models (LLMs). Global pruning achieves strong performance but requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning while reducing memory cost from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.

Active learning is a method to reduce annotation cost in deep learning, but existing algorithms focus primarily on unimodal data, neglecting the challenges in multimodal learning. This study introduces a framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where acquiring cross-modal alignments is prioritized over obtaining labels on pre-aligned pairs. A new algorithm is developed that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, resulting in linear-time acquisition suitable for both pool-based and streaming-based scenarios. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the approach significantly reduces multimodal annotation cost while maintaining performance. For example, on the ColorSwap dataset, annotation requirements are reduced by up to 40% without sacrificing accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.

Summary:
Neural operator architectures were evaluated for rapid prediction of brain displacement fields to enable real-time traumatic brain injury (TBI) modeling. The study formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem using subject-specific anatomical MRI and MRE stiffness maps. Four architectures were assessed across relevant frequencies, with Multi-Grid FNO achieving the highest accuracy and preserving fine-scale features. Factorized FNO showed faster convergence, while Deep Operator Network offered the fastest inference speed. Overall, neural operators significantly reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. This advancement paves the way for real-time patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage support, and optimization of protective equipment. The potential for neural operator-based digital twins of the human brain opens possibilities for scalable biomechanical modeling in clinical and population health settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over 69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$ computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient, resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable, on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health contexts.

Summary: 
Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) have shown high efficiency in inference but face challenges such as vanishing gradients and high training cost. By reparametrizing logic gate neurons, the authors propose a solution that reduces model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. The new parametrization also maintains stable or superior accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset. This innovation addresses issues related to discretization errors and gradient vanishing, allowing for scalability and improved training efficiency in DLGNs. <div>

Abstract: Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) exhibit extraordinary efficiency at inference while sustaining competitive accuracy. But vanishing gradients, discretization errors, and high training cost impede scaling these networks. Even with dedicated parameter initialization schemes from subsequent works, increasing depth still harms accuracy. We show that the root cause of these issues lies in the underlying parametrization of logic gate neurons themselves. To overcome this issue, we propose a reparametrization that also shrinks the parameter size logarithmically in the number of inputs per gate. For binary inputs, this already reduces the model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. On top of that, we show that the accuracy on CIFAR-100 remains stable and sometimes superior to the original parametrization.

arXiv:2510.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many methods aim to enhance time series forecasting by decomposing the series through intricate model structures and prior knowledge, yet they are inevitably limited by computational complexity and the robustness of the assumptions. Our research uncovers that in the complex domain and higher-order hypercomplex spaces, the characteristic frequencies of time series naturally decrease. Leveraging this insight, we propose Numerion, a time series forecasting model based on multiple hypercomplex spaces. Specifically, grounded in theoretical support, we generalize linear layers and activation functions to hypercomplex spaces of arbitrary power-of-two dimensions and introduce a novel Real-Hypercomplex-Real Domain Multi-Layer Perceptron (RHR-MLP) architecture. Numerion utilizes multiple RHR-MLPs to map time series into hypercomplex spaces of varying dimensions, naturally decomposing and independently modeling the series, and adaptively fuses the latent patterns exhibited in different spaces through a dynamic fusion mechanism. Experiments validate the model`s performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets. Visualizations and quantitative analyses comprehensively demonstrate the ability of multi-dimensional RHR-MLPs to naturally decompose time series and reveal the tendency of higher dimensional hypercomplex spaces to capture lower frequency features.

Summary:
Diffusion Router (DR) presents a solution for universal multi-domain translation (MDT) by enabling both direct and indirect translations between any pair of K domains using only K-1 paired datasets with a central domain. The unified diffusion-based framework of DR utilizes a noise predictor conditioned on source and target domain labels to model all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations, allowing for indirect mappings through the central domain. Furthermore, DR introduces a scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings effectively. Through evaluation on various UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results, reduces sampling costs, and enables tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. This establishes DR as a versatile and scalable framework for universal translation across multiple domains. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Hierarchical Preference Learning (HPL) for optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents by leveraging preference signals at multiple granularities. HPL addresses the granularity mismatch in preference-based offline methods by incorporating trajectory- and step-level DPO and introducing a dual-layer curriculum for group-level preference optimization. HPL decomposes expert trajectories into action groups, generates contrasting suboptimal groups for fine-grained preference learning, and implements a curriculum scheduler for organizing the learning process based on group length and sample difficulty. Experiment results on three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing methods by effectively integrating preference signals across multiple granularities and enabling the agent to solve tasks ranging from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences. <div>
arXiv:2510.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents are increasingly tasked with solving complex, long-horizon problems. Aligning these agents via preference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch. Trajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit assignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of multi-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical Preference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents by leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While HPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy stability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization guided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert trajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates contrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained, sub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL introduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from simple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group length, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by the reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO loss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities, while the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a wide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.

Summary:  
- Adversarial machine learning involves training classifiers to defend against attacks from active adversaries in scenarios like spam filtering and malware detection.  
- Pessimistic bilevel optimization is effective in training resilient classifiers by modeling scenarios as a game between learner and adversary.  
- Existing approaches with unrestricted adversaries may lead to overly pessimistic and unrealistic models, impacting classifier performance.  
- A constrained pessimistic bilevel optimization model restricts adversary movements, leading to a solution that better reflects reality and improves classifier performance.  
- Experimental results demonstrate that the constrained model outperforms existing approaches on average. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial machine learning concerns situations in which learners face attacks from active adversaries. Such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the everimproving generation of malicious data. Pessimistic Bilevel optimisation has been shown to be an effective method of training resilient classifiers against such adversaries. By modelling these scenarios as a game between the learner and the adversary, we anticipate how the adversary will modify their data and then train a resilient classifier accordingly. However, since existing pessimistic bilevel approaches feature an unrestricted adversary, the model is vulnerable to becoming overly pessimistic and unrealistic. When finding the optimal solution that defeats the classifier, it is possible that the adversary's data becomes nonsensical and loses its intended nature. Such an adversary will not properly reflect reality, and consequently, will lead to poor classifier performance when implemented on real-world data. By constructing a constrained pessimistic bilevel optimisation model, we restrict the adversary's movements and identify a solution that better reflects reality. We demonstrate through experiments that this model performs, on average, better than the existing approach.

Summary:
In this study, the authors introduce SciTS, a benchmark for scientific time series analysis spanning various domains and tasks. They evaluate 17 models, including text-only and multimodal large language models (LLMs), as well as unified time series models, finding that general-purpose LLMs exhibit better generalizability compared to specialized time series models. They note limitations in representing time series as text or images, leading to decreased performance due to long sequences or loss of numerical precision. To address these issues, the authors introduce TimeOmni, a framework that enables LLMs to comprehend and generate time series data while maintaining compatibility with general-purpose LLM training methods. This work fills a gap in both benchmarking approaches and modeling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way for LLMs to effectively understand and generate complex temporal scientific data. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention. Time series, as a fundamental modality in scientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in current multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or convert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive scientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time series models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their effectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains unclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12 scientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and multivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz in frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal LLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs exhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We then introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to understand and generate time series while remaining compatible with general-purpose LLM training. This work fills a gap in both dedicated benchmarks and modelling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way for LLMs to understand and generate complex temporal scientific data.

Summary: 
On-demand ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft face the challenge of efficiently matching passengers to available vehicles in real-time. Traditional methods such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) struggle due to the vast observation and action spaces. To address these limitations, Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning method, is proposed. It employs an action decomposition strategy to handle the extensive action space and utilizes a BERT-based network with an attention mechanism to capture complex relationships among drivers and orders. Testing on real-world data from Manhattan shows that Triple-BERT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by improving order serving rates by 4.26% and reducing pickup times by 22.25%. The code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .

Summary: The paper introduces a new method, POEM, for test-time adaptation that focuses on exploring reliable samples overlooked by existing methods due to predefined entropy thresholds. By incorporating an Adapt Branch network, POEM strikes a balance between domain-agnostic representations and high performance on target data. Extensive experiments across various architectures show that POEM outperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts while remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is validated through thorough analyses and ablation studies. Additionally, the core idea of POEM can be used as an augmentation strategy to enhance the performance of current test-time adaptation approaches. The source code for POEM is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ycarobot/POEM.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to transfer knowledge from a source model to unknown test data with potential distribution shifts in an online manner. Many existing TTA methods rely on entropy as a confidence metric to optimize the model. However, these approaches are sensitive to the predefined entropy threshold, influencing which samples are chosen for model adaptation. Consequently, potentially reliable target samples are often overlooked and underutilized. For instance, a sample's entropy might slightly exceed the threshold initially, but fall below it after the model is updated. Such samples can provide stable supervised information and offer a normal range of gradients to guide model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a general approach, \underline{POEM}, to promote TTA via ex\underline{\textbf{p}}loring the previously unexpl\underline{\textbf{o}}red reliabl\underline{\textbf{e}} sa\underline{\textbf{m}}ples. Additionally, we introduce an extra Adapt Branch network to strike a balance between extracting domain-agnostic representations and achieving high performance on target data. Comprehensive experiments across multiple architectures demonstrate that POEM consistently outperforms existing TTA methods in both challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts, while remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is evaluated through extensive analyses and thorough ablation studies. Moreover, the core idea behind POEM can be employed as an augmentation strategy to boost the performance of existing TTA approaches.

Summary: The study introduces a training pipeline called MASA that enhances meta-awareness in reasoning models, improving accuracy without the need for external training sources. By aligning meta-predictions with true rollouts, significant performance gains are achieved. MASA filters out irrelevant prompts and truncates lengthy rollouts to improve training efficiency. Results show a 1.28x speedup in training and a 19.3% accuracy gain on in-domain tasks, along with a 6.2% average improvement across mathematics benchmarks. Out-of-domain generalization is enhanced, with a 3.87% boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08% accuracy gain on 13 benchmarks spanning various domains. The study demonstrates the importance of meta-awareness in reasoning models and the effectiveness of self-alignment techniques in enhancing model performance and generalization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on reasoning models explore the meta-awareness of language models, the ability to know how to think by itself. We argue that large reasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe misalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit that aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant performance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline that boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced meta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing meta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training sources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover, our method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts that are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when they are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our strategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training efficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over 1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on AIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks. Training with meta-cognitive guidance enhances out-of-domain generalization, giving a 3.87 % boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08 % overall accuracy gain across 13 benchmarks spanning logical, scientific, and coding domains.

Summary:<br />
Zero-Shot Learning is crucial for General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems operating in open-world scenarios. Semantic spaces bridge seen and unseen classes but can be noisy. A partitioning scheme simulates unseen conditions, enabling attribute relevance assessment without semantic information. Two feature-selection strategies, embedded feature selection and evolutionary computation, improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy. RFS is efficient and competitive with critical hyperparameters, while GA explores the search space broadly without such dependence. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm semantic spaces' inherent redundancy and the effectiveness of the partitioning scheme for refinement under inductive conditions. <div>
arXiv:2510.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Learning is an important paradigm within General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems, particularly in those that operate in open-world scenarios where systems must adapt to new tasks dynamically. Semantic spaces play a pivotal role as they bridge seen and unseen classes, but whether human-annotated or generated by a machine learning model, they often contain noisy, redundant, or irrelevant attributes that hinder performance. To address this, we introduce a partitioning scheme that simulates unseen conditions in an inductive setting (which is the most challenging), allowing attribute relevance to be assessed without access to semantic information from unseen classes. Within this framework, we study two complementary feature-selection strategies and assess their generalisation. The first adapts embedded feature selection to the particular demands of ZSL, turning model-driven rankings into meaningful semantic pruning; the second leverages evolutionary computation to directly explore the space of attribute subsets more broadly. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (AWA2, CUB, SUN, aPY, FLO) show that both methods consistently improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy, but in complementary ways: RFS is efficient and competitive though dependent on critical hyperparameters, whereas GA is more costly yet explores the search space more broadly and avoids such dependence. These results confirm that semantic spaces are inherently redundant and highlight the proposed partitioning scheme as an effective tool to refine them under inductive conditions.

In a new study, researchers introduce a novel approach using neural networks to predict temperature and heat flux fields in machine tools. This allows for the computation and correction of various types of thermal errors with modular downstream components. The neural network is trained using data from the finite element method under different initial conditions and utilizes a correlation-based selection strategy to identify key measurement points, reducing hardware requirements during inference. The study benchmarks several time-series neural network architectures and finds accurate and cost-effective prediction of temperature and heat flux fields. This work establishes a foundation for flexible and generalizable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal errors in machine tools significantly impact machining precision and productivity. Traditional thermal error correction/compensation methods rely on measured temperature-deformation fields or on transfer functions. Most existing data-driven compensation strategies employ neural networks (NNs) to directly predict thermal errors or specific compensation values. While effective, these approaches are tightly bound to particular error types, spatial locations, or machine configurations, limiting their generality and adaptability. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict high-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The proposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide range of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is trained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying initial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that identifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware requirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art time-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal Convolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for specific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to unseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of temperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and generalisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.

<div> orthogonal, Monte Carlo Dropout, LoRA, semantic vectors, compositionality
<br />
Summary:<br /> 
The article introduces Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a method to ensure orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without additional time complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning technique for large models, focuses on training modules to represent specific concepts like objects or styles. However, merging multiple LoRAs can lead to interference among their semantic vectors. Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout aims to keep merged LoRAs orthogonal to prevent direct interference. Despite this, empirical analysis shows that orthogonality alone does not necessarily result in semantic disentanglement or compositionality as desired. The research suggests that achieving true semantic compositionality may require more than just ensuring orthogonality between LoRAs, prompting a reevaluation of the role of orthogonality in adapter merging. <div>

Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style. When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the misuse of modern text-to-image models for creating harmful content and introduces the concept of machine unlearning to selectively remove knowledge from models. It highlights the challenges of forgetting specific concepts and the emergence of unlearned concepts through adversarial prompts. The Memory Self-Regeneration task and MemoRa strategy are proposed to support effective recovery of lost knowledge. The importance of robustness in knowledge retrieval as an evaluation measure for unlearning techniques is emphasized. The study reveals two distinct ways of forgetting: short-term, with quick recall, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging. Overall, the paper sheds light on the complexities of forgetting in machine learning models and underscores the need for more robust and effective unlearning techniques. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The impressive capability of modern text-to-image models to generate realistic visuals has come with a serious drawback: they can be misused to create harmful, deceptive or unlawful content. This has accelerated the push for machine unlearning. This new field seeks to selectively remove specific knowledge from a model's training data without causing a drop in its overall performance. However, it turns out that actually forgetting a given concept is an extremely difficult task. Models exposed to attacks using adversarial prompts show the ability to generate so-called unlearned concepts, which can be not only harmful but also illegal. In this paper, we present considerations regarding the ability of models to forget and recall knowledge, introducing the Memory Self-Regeneration task. Furthermore, we present MemoRa strategy, which we consider to be a regenerative approach supporting the effective recovery of previously lost knowledge. Moreover, we propose that robustness in knowledge retrieval is a crucial yet underexplored evaluation measure for developing more robust and effective unlearning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that forgetting occurs in two distinct ways: short-term, where concepts can be quickly recalled, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging.

Summary:
- Introducing reasoning data during pretraining enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities.
- Front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical, providing foundational capabilities that later fine-tuning cannot replicate.
- Pretraining benefits most from diverse reasoning patterns, while SFT is more sensitive to data quality.
- High-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT.
- Naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
Introducing reasoning data during pretraining significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities, establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage fine-tuning. Pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns, while SFT is more sensitive to data quality. High-quality pretraining data has latent effects that are activated only after SFT, highlighting the importance of strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models. Naively scaling SFT data can have detrimental effects, underscoring the need for a principled approach to data allocation during the training process. <div>
arXiv:2510.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs revolves around post-training on high-quality, reasoning-intensive data. While emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT, even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training pipeline to build more capable models.

Summary:
Concept Trees, inspired by causal inference, use spectral decomposition to uncover the internal structure and stabilization of concepts in large-scale foundation models. By identifying branching Concept Paths through principal directions, Concept Trees reveal how concepts diverge from shared representations into linearly separable subspaces.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models demonstrate strong performance across language, vision, and reasoning tasks. However, how they internally structure and stabilize concepts remains elusive. Inspired by causal inference, we introduce the MindCraft framework built upon Concept Trees. By applying spectral decomposition at each layer and linking principal directions into branching Concept Paths, Concept Trees reconstruct the hierarchical emergence of concepts, revealing exactly when they diverge from shared representations into linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across multiple domains. The Concept Tree establishes a widely applicable and powerful framework that enables in-depth analysis of conceptual representations in deep models, marking a significant step forward in the foundation of interpretable AI.

Abstract: Climate anomalies significantly impact terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics, necessitating robust methods for detecting and analyzing anomalous behavior in plant productivity. This study presents a novel application of variational autoencoders (VAE) for identifying extreme events in gross primary productivity (GPP) from Community Earth System Model version 2 simulations across four AR6 regions in the Continental United States. We compare VAE-based anomaly detection with traditional singular spectral analysis (SSA) methods across three time periods: 1850-80, 1950-80, and 2050-80 under the SSP585 scenario. The VAE architecture employs three dense layers and a latent space with an input sequence length of 12 months, trained on a normalized GPP time series to reconstruct the GPP and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extreme events are defined using 5th percentile thresholds applied to both VAE and SSA anomalies. Results demonstrate strong regional agreement between VAE and SSA methods in spatial patterns of extreme event frequencies, despite VAE producing higher threshold values (179-756 GgC for VAE vs. 100-784 GgC for SSA across regions and periods). Both methods reveal increasing magnitudes and frequencies of negative carbon cycle extremes toward 2050-80, particularly in Western and Central North America. The VAE approach shows comparable performance to established SSA techniques, while offering computational advantages and enhanced capability for capturing non-linear temporal dependencies in carbon cycle variability. Unlike SSA, the VAE method does not require one to define the periodicity of the signals in the data; it discovers them from the data.

<div> Ternarization, Large Language Models, Post-training quantization, Compression, Computational efficiency<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to address the challenges of training-free parameter optimization and quantization difficulties faced by LLMs. PT$^2$-LLM utilizes an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer with a two-stage refinement pipeline consisting of Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF) and Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA) to minimize quantization error and improve precision. Additionally, a Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy is proposed to enhance quantization and mitigate outlier effects. Experimental results show that PT$^2$-LLM achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art 2-bit Post-Training Quantization methods, with lower memory cost and improved speed for prefill and decoding. The code and models for PT$^2$-LLM will be made available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but their large memory and compute demands hinder deployment. Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique, delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency. However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA), which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs. In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering (SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve end-to-end speedup. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PT2-LLM.

<div> dimension collapse, multimodal contrastive learning, modality gap, downstream performance, hyperplane rotation<br />
<br />
Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to integrate data from different modalities into a shared embedding space. However, the phenomenon of the modality gap, where representations from different modalities occupy separate regions of the embedding space, has been observed. This study introduces a theoretical framework to analyze optimal representations and modality alignment in MCL. It is proven that without constraints, the modality gap diminishes. Under the subspace constraint, causing dimension collapse, the gap converges to the smallest angle between the distinct hyperplanes. The role of the modality gap in downstream performance is linked to the alignment between sample pairs, which cannot be perfectly achieved under the subspace constraint. However, perfect alignment can be attained through hyperplane rotation or shared space projection.This research highlights the impact of dimension collapse as the underlying cause of the modality gap and provides insights into achieving alignment and performance optimization in multimodal contrastive learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to embed data from different modalities in a shared embedding space. However, empirical evidence shows that representations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of embedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover, experimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream performance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1) What causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To address these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality alignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any constraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero. Under the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall into two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap converges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result identifies \emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality gap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be perfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences downstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We prove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be achieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection.

Summary: 
The article addresses the limitations of current exploration methods in reinforcement learning with human feedback, showing unintentional biases towards high-probability regions of the reference model. It introduces the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB) framework as a solution to this issue, ensuring exploration in uncertain regions while satisfying the optimism principle. GEB regulates rewards based on a reference model, outperforming existing bonuses in various tasks and language model backbones. The framework unifies previous heuristic bonuses and extends to different divergence settings, providing a principled and effective approach for optimistic exploration in reinforcement learning with human feedback. GEB offers a theoretical basis and practical implementation for improving sample efficiency and promoting discovery in RLHF domains.

arXiv:2510.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Decision Potential Surface (DPS) as a new concept for analyzing decision boundaries in large language models (LLMs). DPS is based on the confidence levels in distinguishing different sampling sequences for each input, providing insights into the potential of decision boundaries. The zero-height isohypse in DPS represents the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions indicating decision regions. The authors propose the K-DPS algorithm, which approximates an LLM's decision boundary with minimal error using a finite number of sequence samplings. The paper includes theoretical bounds for absolute error, expected error, and error concentration between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, showing that errors can be controlled by the number of samples. Empirical experiments across various LLMs and datasets validate the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: Decision boundary, the subspace of inputs where a machine learning model assigns equal classification probabilities to two classes, is pivotal in revealing core model properties and interpreting behaviors. While analyzing the decision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing attention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally infeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose Decision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision boundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different sampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of decision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent to the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision regions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an approximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which only requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's decision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper bounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be trade-off with sampling times. Our results are empirically validated by extensive experiments across various LLMs and corpora.

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, spatiotemporal dynamical system, PDE, stabilization mechanisms, deep neural networks

Summary:
In this paper, a new analytical framework is introduced to understand the Transformer architecture as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The core components of the Transformer are reimagined as distinct mathematical operators within this framework. It is found that self-attention functions as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and residual connections and layer normalization as critical stabilization mechanisms. By conducting experiments comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator lacking stabilizers, it is shown that residual connections prevent catastrophic representational drift, while layer normalization stabilizes training dynamics. These findings highlight the mathematical necessity of these components in taming the inherent instability of the continuous system underlying the Transformer architecture. This work offers a foundational explanation for the design of the Transformer and presents a new approach for analyzing deep neural networks.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks through the lens of continuous dynamics.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), while foundational to deep learning, imposes two critical scalability bottlenecks: update locking, where network modules remain idle until the entire backward pass completes, and high memory consumption due to storing activations for gradient computation. To address these limitations, we introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training framework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative refinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of modules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief about the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target with consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the backward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence eliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements. Meanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass, making SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical foundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with network depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the classification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced robustness to label noise.Code is available at: https://github.com/ychAlbert/sid-bp

Summary: 

Quant-dLLM is a new framework designed for ultra-low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) of diffusion large language models (dLLMs). It addresses the challenges in directly transferring PTQ to dLLMs at 2-bit precision, which typically results in subpar performance. The framework includes Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the masked denoising activations of dLLMs, improving reliability. It also introduces Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) for learning ultra-low-bit weight representations through iterative optimization guided by simulated calibration data. Additionally, Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP) is proposed for adaptive bit width allocation across channel groups under a strict 2-bit budget.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which offer bidirectional context and flexible masked-denoising generation, are emerging as a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs. However, like AR LLMs, their model sizes continue to grow, motivating weight compression for deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width across channel groups. When restricted to 2-bit precision, Quant-dLLM consistently achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) AR-transfer PTQ methods on dLLMs. The code and models will be available at: https://github.com/ZTA2785/Quant-dLLM.

<div> Sigma-Delta Quantization, Large Language Models, Extremely low-bit quantization, Over-Sampling Ratio, Inference efficiency<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) require efficient deployment due to computational challenges, leading to the development of the Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs (SDQ-LLM). This framework allows for extremely low-bit quantization while maintaining linguistic reasoning capabilities by utilizing adjustable Over-Sampling Ratios (OSR) for optimal trade-offs between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM incorporates upsampling and Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLM weights, improving inference efficiency under low-bit quantization. Weight smoothing and a MultiOSR allocation strategy further enhance precision and reduce quantization sensitivity. Experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate high-precision performance under aggressive low-OSR settings. The code for SDQ-LLM is available for access on GitHub at https://github.com/Dreamlittlecat/LLM-Quant-Factory.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities. A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy, MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive low-OSR settings.

Abstract: The combination of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions forms the foundation of most modern deep neural networks, enabling them to approximate highly complex functions. This paper explores the introduction of quadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks, with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce parameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight quadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification techniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces quadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding negligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across three tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning large-language models. In all tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates clear and substantial performance gains.

Summary:<br />
A new study introduces Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) to solve differential equations under uncertainty, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of uncertainty and overconfidence in physical constraints. The study presents a scalable Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian to quantify the influence of individual physical constraints on the network's loss landscape. By applying the framework to the Van der Pol equation, researchers track how constraints shape the network's geometry and reveal the redistribution of curvature and dominance with changes in loss weights. This analysis provides insights into the complex interplay between physical constraints and network behavior, shedding light on the mechanisms behind overconfidence in B-PINNs and offering a new approach to understanding their performance. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) merge data with governing equations to solve differential equations under uncertainty. However, interpreting uncertainty and overconfidence in B-PINNs requires care due to the poorly understood effects the physical constraints have on the network; overconfidence could reflect warranted precision, enforced by the constraints, rather than miscalibration. Motivated by the need to further clarify how individual physical constraints shape these networks, we introduce a scalable, matrix-free Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian into contributions from each constraint and provides metrics to quantify their relative influence on the loss landscape. Applied to the Van der Pol equation, our method tracks how constraints sculpt the network's geometry and shows, directly through the Hessian, how changing a single loss weight non-trivially redistributes curvature and effective dominance across the others.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in long-sequence modeling due to the trade-offs between efficiency and memory. Existing methods such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers have limitations in scaling and capturing long-range dependencies. The selective state-space model Mamba has shown high efficiency but suffers from exponential memory decay. The study delves into the memory decay mechanism of Mamba through mathematical derivations and information-theoretic analysis. By introducing horizontal-vertical memory fidelity metrics, the research quantifies information loss within and across layers. Inspired by human information retention mechanisms, the MemMamba framework is proposed, integrating state summarization and cross-layer and cross-token attention mechanisms to address long-range forgetting while maintaining linear complexity. Empirical results show significant improvements over existing models on long-sequence benchmarks, with a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. MemMamba offers a breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, paving the way for ultra-long sequence modeling. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become increasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and bioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between efficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing and explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global dependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective state-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n) time and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays exponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and information-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay mechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of Mamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key information loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity metrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how humans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we propose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state summarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention, which alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity. MemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and Transformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval, while delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for ultra-long sequence modeling.

Summary:
Interpreting language models involves circuit analysis to identify specific subnetworks. Current algorithms face a trade-off between speed and faithfulness, with attribution patching being fast but unfaithful, and edge pruning faithful but computationally expensive. A new Hybrid Attribution and Pruning (HAP) framework combines attribution patching and edge pruning to efficiently identify high-potential subgraphs and extract faithful circuits. HAP is 46% faster than baseline methods while maintaining circuit faithfulness. A case study on the Indirect Object Identification task demonstrates that HAP preserves important circuit components that other methods may overlook at high sparsity levels. This research shows that HAP could enhance the scalability of interpretability research for larger models. The code for HAP is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Interpreting language models often involves circuit analysis, which aims to identify sparse subnetworks, or circuits, that accomplish specific tasks. Existing circuit discovery algorithms face a fundamental trade-off: attribution patching is fast but unfaithful to the full model, while edge pruning is faithful but computationally expensive. This research proposes a hybrid attribution and pruning (HAP) framework that uses attribution patching to identify a high-potential subgraph, then applies edge pruning to extract a faithful circuit from it. We show that HAP is 46\% faster than baseline algorithms without sacrificing circuit faithfulness. Furthermore, we present a case study on the Indirect Object Identification task, showing that our method preserves cooperative circuit components (e.g. S-inhibition heads) that attribution patching methods prune at high sparsity. Our results show that HAP could be an effective approach for improving the scalability of mechanistic interpretability research to larger models.

arXiv:2510.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed on edge servers are increasingly used in latency-sensitive applications such as personalized assistants, recommendation, and content moderation. However, the non-stationary nature of user data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental tension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU resources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates, over-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining granularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is crucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating service-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that colocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with intelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising inference throughput. MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates equally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance throughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows that MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference latency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints. Compared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across prefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in NVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid scheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning capabilities on edge platforms.

Summary: 
Log-based anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring software system reliability and performance. Existing methods heavily rely on manual labeling, which is challenging due to the large volume of logs. To address this issue, LogAction introduces a novel approach based on active domain adaptation.

This approach mitigates the cold-start problem and addresses data distribution gaps with minimal human labeling efforts.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

arXiv:2510.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but face prohibitive computational and memory costs. Pruning offers a promising path by inducing sparsity while preserving architectural flexibility. However, existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and robustness: local metric approaches prune layer by layer but often collapse under high sparsity, whereas global feedback methods enforce consistency at the cost of expensive weight updates or restrictive semi-structured formats. We present UniPruning, a unified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror descent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning leverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to allocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and semi-structured N :M pruning within one framework. After a brief calibration, it can generate pruning masks for arbitrary sparsity levels in one shot, and adapts seamlessly to hardware-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple pretrained LLM families and standard benchmarks show that UniPruning consistently delivers competitive or superior perplexity and zero-shot accuracy. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of mirror descent and local saliency anchoring. Overall, UniPruning provides an efficient, principled, and scalable solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/RainbowQTT/UniPruning.

Summary: <br />
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity via conditional routing, but face challenges in balancing load during inference due to expert overload. LASER is a plug-and-play algorithm that addresses this issue by adapting to the gate's score distribution. It routes tokens based on gate scores, optimizing load balance without the need for retraining. Evaluation on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat datasets shows that LASER improves load balancing, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput while maintaining accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2510.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity by routing each token to a subset of experts through a learned gate function. While conditional routing reduces training costs, it shifts the burden on inference memory: expert parameters and activations consume memory, limiting the number of experts per device. As tokens are routed, some experts become overloaded while others are underutilized. Because experts are mapped to GPUs, this imbalance translates directly into degraded system performance in terms of latency, throughput, and cost. We present LASER, a plug-and-play, inference-time routing algorithm that balances load while preserving accuracy. LASER adapts to the shape of the gate's score distribution. When scores provide a clear preference, it routes to the strongest experts; when scores are more uniform, it broadens the set of viable experts and routes to the least-loaded among them. Because LASER relies only on gate scores from a trained model, it integrates directly into existing MoE inference pipelines without retraining or finetuning. We evaluate LASER on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat across four datasets (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and GSM8K). LASER improves load balancing, translating into lower latency and higher throughput, while keeping the accuracy changes negligible.

Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual Optimization (CAFL-L) is introduced as an extension of FedAvg, incorporating device-level constraints such as energy, communication, memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L uses Lagrangian dual optimization to adjust training hyperparameters dynamically while maintaining stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation. Experimental results on a character-level language model show that CAFL-L outperforms standard FedAvg by achieving better constraint satisfaction, reducing memory usage by 20%, and communication by 95%. Despite these improvements, the validation performance remains competitive, making CAFL-L suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual Optimization (CAFL-L), a principled extension of FedAvg that explicitly incorporates device-level resource constraints including energy, communication, memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L employs Lagrangian dual optimization to dynamically adapt training hyperparameters -- freezing depth, local steps, batch size, and communication compression -- while preserving training stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation. Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive validation performance, making it practical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Summary: Concept erasure techniques in T2I diffusion models are vital for safety and copyright concerns. However, as models progress to next-gen architectures like Flux, traditional erasure methods are less effective. Research shows that erasure methods only create the illusion of forgetting, biasing sampling trajectories away from target concepts. A new framework, Revoking Amnesia (RevAm), utilizes RL-based trajectory optimization to dynamically steer the denoising process without altering model weights. By adapting GRPO to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, achieving superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time. This highlights shortcomings in current safety mechanisms and the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.

Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly applied in climate modeling on system emulation acceleration, data-driven parameter inference, forecasting, and knowledge discovery, addressing challenges such as physical consistency, multi-scale coupling, data sparsity, robust generalization, and integration with scientific workflows. This paper analyzes a series of case studies from applied machine learning research in climate modeling, with a focus on design choices and workflow structure. Rather than reviewing technical details, we aim to synthesize workflow design patterns across diverse projects in ML-enabled climate modeling: from surrogate modeling, ML parameterization, probabilistic programming, to simulation-based inference, and physics-informed transfer learning. We unpack how these workflows are grounded in physical knowledge, informed by simulation data, and designed to integrate observations. We aim to offer a framework for ensuring rigor in scientific machine learning through more transparent model development, critical evaluation, informed adaptation, and reproducibility, and to contribute to lowering the barrier for interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of data science and climate modeling.

Summary:
The study explores the use of thin contrastive bridges as a lightweight alternative to pretraining heavy multimodal models for drug discovery and biomedical applications. By aligning molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections, the researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in aligning chemical and textual representations. Incorporating hard negative weighting and margin loss, the method improves within target discrimination and enhances cross-modal alignment across disjoint chemical cores, particularly beneficial for drugs targeting the same therapeutic target. The results suggest that these thin bridges offer a computationally efficient solution for scaffold-aware drug-text alignment and target-specific retrieval in precision medicine. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models hold promise for drug discovery and biomedical applications, but most existing approaches rely on heavy pretraining or large scale multimodal corpora. We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges, lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.

Summary: LLMs are being used to simulate human behavior in business and social science, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in replicating human behavior in operations management. The research finds that while LLMs can reproduce most hypothesis-level effects and capture key decision biases, there are divergences in response distributions compared to human data. The study also tests two interventions, chain-of-thought prompting and hyperparameter tuning, which help reduce misalignment and enable smaller or open-source models to match or surpass larger systems in some cases. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in modeling human behavior in operations management and the importance of considering interventions to improve model performance.<br /> <div>

Abstract: LLMs are emerging tools for simulating human behavior in business, economics, and social science, offering a lower-cost complement to laboratory experiments, field studies, and surveys. This paper evaluates how well LLMs replicate human behavior in operations management. Using nine published experiments in behavioral operations, we assess two criteria: replication of hypothesis-test outcomes and distributional alignment via Wasserstein distance. LLMs reproduce most hypothesis-level effects, capturing key decision biases, but their response distributions diverge from human data, including for strong commercial models. We also test two lightweight interventions -- chain-of-thought prompting and hyperparameter tuning -- which reduce misalignment and can sometimes let smaller or open-source models match or surpass larger systems.

<div> quality-aware scaling law, data quality parameter, model size, data volume, Chinchilla framework

Summary: 
The study introduces a quality-aware scaling law in language model training that considers data quality as a key factor alongside model size and dataset volume. The law incorporates a dimensionless data-quality parameter, Q, and extends the Chinchilla framework to predict loss through a joint function of model size, data volume, and data quality. By conducting synthetic experiments in neural machine translation and autoregressive modeling with controlled data quality variations, the study demonstrates that loss scales predictably with data quality. Higher-quality data can lead to reduced model size and compute requirements, with a sublinear decay of effective data with quality. The study also provides estimators for measuring data quality, such as a corruption rate proxy and a deficiency measure. This work establishes a clear and generalizable law for data quality, offering insights into optimizing data curation effort and model scale in large-scale pretraining.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws for language model training traditionally characterize how performance scales with model size and dataset volume. Prior work has explored architecture variants and data treatments such as dataset filtering and noise injection in language model pretraining; however, these studies have not formalized data quality within a principled scaling law. We introduce a dimensionless data-quality parameter Q, and propose a quality-aware scaling law extending the Chinchilla framework to predict loss as a joint function of model size, data volume, and data quality. The law is motivated by an effective-sample-size and information-theoretic view of noisy or redundant corpora, and it admits two practical estimators for Q: (i) a corruption rate proxy and (ii) a deficiency measure. Through synthetic experiments in neural machine translation and autoregressive modeling -- where we systematically control data quality via multiple levels of noise injection and coverage variation -- we show that loss scales predictably with data quality and that higher-quality data can substantially reduce model size and hence compute requirements. Our results demonstrate a sublinear decay of effective data with quality and robustness to moderate data corruption; out-of-sample evaluations further validate the predictive form of the law. Unlike prior empirical analyses, our work establishes an explicit, generalizable law for data quality, offering concrete guidance for balancing data curation effort and model scale in large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: The reconstruction of a frequency with minimal delay from a sinusoidal signal is a common task in several fields; for example Ring Laser Gyroscopes, since their output signal is a beat frequency. While conventional methods require several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10 milliseconds. This enables rapid trigger generation. The method outperforms standard Fourier-based techniques, improving frequency estimation precision by a factor of 2 in the operational range of GINGERINO, our Ring Laser Gyroscope.\\ In addition to fast frequency estimation, we introduce an automated classification framework to identify physical disturbances in the signal, such as laser instabilities and seismic events, achieving accuracy rates between 99\% and 100\% on independent test datasets for the seismic class. These results mark a step forward in integrating artificial intelligence into signal analysis for geophysical applications.

Abstract: The training process of reinforcement learning often suffers from severe oscillations, leading to instability and degraded performance. In this paper, we propose a Constant in an Ever-Changing World (CIC) framework that enhances algorithmic stability to improve performance. CIC maintains both a representative policy and a current policy. Instead of updating the representative policy blindly, CIC selectively updates it only when the current policy demonstrates superiority. Furthermore, CIC employs an adaptive adjustment mechanism, enabling the representative and current policies to jointly facilitate critic training. We evaluate CIC on five MuJoCo environments, and the results show that CIC improves the performance of conventional algorithms without incurring additional computational cost.

<title>Semantic-Aware Scheduling for GPU Clusters with Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) schedulers are pivotal in optimizing resource allocation in GPU clusters, but operate with a critical limitation: they are largely blind to the semantic context of the jobs they manage. This forces them to rely on limited metadata, leading to high profiling overhead, unreliable duration estimation, inadequate failure handling, and poor observability. To this end, we propose SchedMate, a framework that bridges this semantic gap by systematically extracting deep insights from overlooked, unstructured data sources: source code, runtime logs, and historical jobs. SchedMate enhances existing schedulers non-intrusively through three LLM-based components. Our implementation integrates seamlessly with existing deep learning schedulers. Evaluations on a 128-GPU physical cluster and extensive simulations on production traces show SchedMate reduces average job completion times by up to 1.91x, substantially enhancing the scheduling performance, demonstrating the critical role of semantic-awareness in modern DL scheduling.

<title>Matching the Optimal Denoiser in Point Cloud Diffusion with (Improved) Rotational Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03335</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a popular class of generative models trained to reverse a noising process starting from a target data distribution. Training a diffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different noise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules and proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To capture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by transforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then, the denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the effect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the optimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over $SO(3)$. Alignment corresponds to sampling the mode of this distribution, and turns out to be the zeroth order approximation for small noise levels, explaining its effectiveness. We build on this perspective to derive better approximators to the optimal denoiser in the limit of small noise. Our experiments highlight that alignment is often a `good enough' approximation for the noise levels that matter most for training diffusion models.

<title>Pool Me Wisely: On the Effect of Pooling in Transformer-Based Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have become the dominant backbone for sequence modeling, leveraging self-attention to produce contextualized token representations. These are typically aggregated into fixed-size vectors via pooling operations for downstream tasks. While much of the literature has focused on attention mechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical impact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework that rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models equipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on their representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs. Our analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations, demonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We empirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and local contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal consistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and optimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical perspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling mechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key architectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more principled model design beyond attention alone.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator, calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health crises.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the aviation industry, there is a need for a large number of flight crew. How to select the right pilots in a cost-efficient manner has become an important research question. In the current study, twenty-three pilots were recruited from China Eastern Airlines, and 23 novices were from the community of Tsinghua University. A novel approach incorporating machine learning and virtual reality technology was applied to distinguish features between these participants with different flight skills. Results indicate that SVM with the MIC feature selection method consistently achieved the highest prediction performance on all metrics with an Accuracy of 0.93, an AUC of 0.96, and an F1 of 0.93, which outperforms four other classifier algorithms and two other feature selection methods. From the perspective of feature selection methods, the MIC method can select features with a nonlinear relationship to sampling labels, instead of a simple filter-out. Our new implementation of the SVM + MIC algorithm outperforms all existing pilot selection algorithms and perhaps provides the first implementation based on eye tracking and flight dynamics data. This study's VR simulation platforms and algorithms can be used for pilot selection and training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex, high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging, long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of 3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of 12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning tasks in critical domains.

Abstract: Nearly one in five adolescents currently live with a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition, such as anxiety, depression, or conduct disorder, underscoring the urgency of developing accurate and interpretable diagnostic tools. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work, we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent, clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.

Abstract: Transformers are widely used across data modalities, and yet the principles distilled from text models often transfer imperfectly to models trained to other modalities. In this paper, we analyze Transformers through the lens of rank structure. Our focus is on the time series setting, where the structural properties of the data differ remarkably from those of text or vision. We show that time-series embeddings, unlike text or vision, exhibit sharply decaying singular value spectra: small patch sizes and smooth continuous mappings concentrate the data into low-rank subspaces. From this, we prove that the associated $Q/K/V$ projections admit accurate low-rank approximations, and that attention layers become compressible in proportion to the decay of the embedding spectrum. We introduce the concept of flow-of-ranks, a phenomenon by which nonlinear mixing across depth inflates the rank, explaining why early layers are most amenable to compression and why ranks grow with depth. Guided by these theoretical and empirical results, we use these insights to compress Chronos, a large time series foundation model, achieving a reduction of $65\%$ in inference time and $81\%$ in memory, without loss of accuracy. Our findings provide principled guidance for allocating width, depth, and heads in time series foundation models, and for exploiting their inherent compressibility.

<title>Physics-informed Neural-operator Predictive Control for Drag Reduction in Turbulent Flows</title>

Abstract: Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source data offers a scalable and transparent foundation for estimating vehicle activity and emissions in urban regions. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area. The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using fully open data sources.

Abstract: High-quality observations of hub-height winds are valuable but sparse in space and time. Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines, WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to independent observations.

<title>Disentangling Recall and Reasoning in Transformer Models through Layer-wise Attention and Activation Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead to selective impairments: disabling identified "recall circuits" reduces fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas disabling "reasoning circuits" reduces multi-step inference by a comparable margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing safer deployment of large language models.

Abstract: The training of large models demands substantial computational resources, typically available only in data centers with high-bandwidth interconnects. However, reducing the reliance on high-bandwidth interconnects between nodes enables the use of distributed compute resources as an alternative to centralized data center training. Building on recent advances in distributed model training, we propose an approach that further reduces communication by combining infrequent synchronizations across distributed model replicas with gradient momentum compression. In particular, we treat the optimizer momentum as a signal and decompose the Nesterov momentum into high- and low-frequency components via the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Only the high-frequency components are synchronized across model replicas every $H$ steps. Empirically, our method achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction in communication compared to the baseline DiLoCo, and it generalizes across architectures, including transformer-based language models and convolutional neural networks for images. Overall, this work advances the feasibility of training large models on distributed nodes with low-bandwidth interconnects.

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by CPSC-DFKD.

<title>A Robust Clustered Federated Learning Approach for Non-IID Data with Quantity Skew</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03380</link>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized paradigm that enables a client-server architecture to collaboratively train a global Artificial Intelligence model without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. A key challenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of Non-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising solution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping clients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally fall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the cluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the server groups clients based on local model similarities. However, most CFL methods lack systematic evaluation under QS but present significant challenges because of it.  In this paper, we present two main contributions. The first one is an evaluation of state-of-the-art CFL algorithms under various Non-IID settings, applying multiple QS scenarios to assess their robustness. Our second contribution is a novel iterative CFL algorithm, named CORNFLQS, which proposes an optimal coordination between both operating strategies of CFL. Our approach is robust against the different variations of QS settings. We conducted intensive experiments on six image classification datasets, resulting in 270 Non-IID configurations. The results show that CORNFLQS achieves the highest average ranking in both accuracy and clustering quality, as well as strong robustness to QS perturbations. Overall, our approach outperforms actual CFL algorithms.

<title>Cross-Modal Reconstruction Pretraining for Ramp Flow Prediction at Highway Interchanges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction. To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data, forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy. Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting model variation are also shared.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware wind power prediction is essential for grid integration and reliable wind farm operation. We apply neural diffusion processes (NDPs)-a recent class of models that learn distributions over functions-and extend them to a multi-task NDP (MT-NDP) framework for wind power prediction. We provide the first empirical evaluation of NDPs in real supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. We introduce a task encoder within MT-NDPs to capture cross-turbine correlations and enable few-shot adaptation to unseen turbines. The proposed MT-NDP framework outperforms single-task NDPs and GPs in terms of point accuracy and calibration, particularly for wind turbines whose behaviour deviates from the fleet average. In general, NDP-based models deliver calibrated and scalable predictions suitable for operational deployment, offering sharper, yet trustworthy, predictive intervals that can support dispatch and maintenance decisions in modern wind farms.

<title>Memory-Efficient Backpropagation for Fine-Tuning LLMs on Resource-Constrained Mobile Devices</title>

arXiv:2510.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with backpropagation\textemdash even for a subset of parameters such as LoRA\textemdash can be much more memory-consuming than inference and is often deemed impractical for resource-constrained mobile devices. Alternative methods, such as zeroth-order optimization (ZO), can greatly reduce the memory footprint but come at the cost of significantly slower model convergence (10$\times$ to 100$\times$ more steps than backpropagation). We propose a memory-efficient implementation of backpropagation (MeBP) on mobile devices that provides better trade-off between memory usage and compute time, while converging faster and achieving better performance than the ZO baseline. We verify the effectiveness of MeBP on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and show that various LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 4B parameters, can be fine-tuned using less than 1GB of memory. We release an example of the MeBP implementation at https://github.com/apple/ml-mebp.

<title>Generalized Orders of Magnitude for Scalable, Parallel, High-Dynamic-Range Computation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1) compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2) estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.

<title>LHGEL: Large Heterogeneous Graph Ensemble Learning using Batch View Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03432</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from large heterogeneous graphs presents significant challenges due to the scale of networks, heterogeneity in node and edge types, variations in nodal features, and complex local neighborhood structures. This paper advocates for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation, residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning. Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Chrisshen12/LHGEL.

Abstract: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

arXiv:2510.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are black boxes -- we cannot observe their neural processes, yet society functions by evaluating verifiable arguments. AI explainability should follow this principle: stakeholders need verifiable reasoning chains, not mechanistic transparency. We propose using structured argumentation to provide a level of explanation and verification neither interpretability nor LLM-generated explanation is able to offer. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7 points above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\sim$0.07 above previous published results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts relation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling verification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent risk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized agents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise achieved by humans alone. Using Bipolar Assumption-Based Argumentation, we capture support/attack relationships, thereby enabling automatic hallucination detection via fact nodes attacking arguments. We also provide a verification mechanism that enables iterative refinement through test-time feedback without retraining. For easy deployment, we provide a Docker container for the fine-tuned AMT model, and the rest of the code with the Bipolar ABA Python package on GitHub.

arXiv:2510.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep residual architectures, such as ResNet and the Transformer, have enabled models of unprecedented depth, yet a formal understanding of why depth is so effective remains an open question. A popular intuition, following Veit et al. (2016), is that these residual networks behave like ensembles of many shallower models. Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this ensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically equivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our expansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial growth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal, explaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep models. This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical dependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of successful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup. However, while these previous approaches infer scaling factors through optimizer analysis or a heuristic analogy to Batch Normalization, our work offers the first explanation derived directly from the network's inherent functional structure. Specifically, our Residual Expansion Theorem reveals that scaling each residual module provides a principled solution to taming the combinatorial explosion inherent to these architectures. We further show that this scaling acts as a capacity controls that also implicitly regularizes the model's complexity.

<title>How to Set $\beta_1, \beta_2$ in Adam: An Online Learning Perspective</title>

Abstract: While Adam is one of the most effective optimizer for training large-scale machine learning models, a theoretical understanding of how to optimally set its momentum factors, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, remains largely incomplete.
  Prior works have shown that Adam can be seen as an instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), one of the most important class of algorithms in online learning.
  The prior analyses in these works required setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$, which does not cover the more practical cases with $\beta_1 \neq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  We derive novel, more general analyses that hold for both $\beta_1 \geq \sqrt{\beta_2}$ and $\beta_1 \leq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  In both cases, our results strictly generalize the existing bounds.
  Furthermore, we show that our bounds are tight in the worst case.
  We also prove that setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$ is optimal for an oblivious adversary, but sub-optimal for an non-oblivious adversary.

<title>Reasoning-based Anomaly Detection Framework: A Real-time, Scalable, and Automated Approach to Anomaly Detection Across Domains</title>

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.

Abstract: We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

<title>Task-Level Contrastiveness for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>

Abstract: Few-shot classification and meta-learning methods typically struggle to generalize across diverse domains, as most approaches focus on a single dataset, failing to transfer knowledge across various seen and unseen domains. Existing solutions often suffer from low accuracy, high computational costs, and rely on restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of task-level contrastiveness, a novel approach designed to address issues of existing methods. We start by introducing simple ways to define task augmentations, and thereafter define a task-level contrastive loss that encourages unsupervised clustering of task representations. Our method is lightweight and can be easily integrated within existing few-shot/meta-learning algorithms while providing significant benefits. Crucially, it leads to improved generalization and computational efficiency without requiring prior knowledge of task domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through different experiments on the MetaDataset benchmark, where it achieves superior performance without additional complexity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded opportunities for innovation but also increased exposure to botnet-driven cyberattacks. Conventional detection methods often struggle with scalability, privacy, and adaptability in resource-constrained IoT environments. To address these challenges, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving botnet detection framework based on federated learning. This approach enables distributed devices to collaboratively train models without exchanging raw data, thus maintaining user privacy while preserving detection accuracy. A communication-efficient aggregation strategy is introduced to reduce overhead, ensuring suitability for constrained IoT networks. Experiments on benchmark IoT botnet datasets demonstrate that the framework achieves high detection accuracy while substantially reducing communication costs. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical path toward scalable, secure, and privacy-aware intrusion detection for IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy for finetuning small language models (SLMs) to solve targeted tasks such as math and coding. However, RL algorithms tend to be resource-intensive, taking a significant amount of time to train. We propose RAPID, a novel RL algorithm that can substantially reduce the running time of RL. Our key insight is that RL tends to be costly due to the need to perform both inference and backpropagation during training. To maximize use of computational resources, our algorithm performs inference in large batches, and then performs off-policy policy gradient updates in mini-batches. For off-policy updates, we incorporate group advantage estimation into the policy gradient algorithm, and derive an importance weighted estimator to correct for the bias arising from off-policy learning. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce running time by 11%-34% on three benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art RL algorithms while maintaining similar or better accuracy.

<title>Certifiable Safe RLHF: Fixed-Penalty Constraint Optimization for Safer Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03520</link>

Abstract: Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models (LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords. Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization, wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts

Abstract: Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.

Abstract: A variety of models have been developed to forecast dengue cases to date. However, it remains a challenge to predict major dengue outbreaks that need timely public warnings the most. In this paper, we introduce CrossLag, an environmentally informed attention that allows for the incorporation of lagging endogenous signals behind the significant events in the exogenous data into the architecture of the transformer at low parameter counts. Outbreaks typically lag behind major changes in climate and oceanic anomalies. We use TimeXer, a recent general-purpose transformer distinguishing exogenous-endogenous inputs, as the baseline for this study. Our proposed model outperforms TimeXer by a considerable margin in detecting and predicting major outbreaks in Singapore dengue data over a 24-week prediction window.

arXiv:2510.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

Abstract: Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention (GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities, maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail, experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to $\sim$25% lower F1-scores.

arXiv:2510.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained attention for solving PDEs, but the black-box nature of neural networks hinders precise enforcement of boundary conditions. To address this, we propose a boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with radial basis functions (BEKAN). In BEKAN, we propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating Dirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For Dirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct univariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode boundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic problems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal functions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we devise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward satisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the periodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE simulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions. For demonstration, we conducted extensive numerical experiments on Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and mixed boundary value problems. The results indicate that BEKAN outperforms both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and B-splines KAN in terms of accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed approach enhances the capability of KANs in solving PDE problems while satisfying boundary conditions, thereby facilitating advancements in scientific computing and engineering applications.

Abstract: Learning dynamics is essential for model-based control and Reinforcement Learning in engineering systems, such as robotics and power systems. However, limited system measurements, such as those from low-resolution sensors, demand sample-efficient learning. Symmetry provides a powerful inductive bias by characterizing equivariant relations in system states to improve sample efficiency. While recent methods attempt to discover symmetries from data, they typically assume a single global symmetry group and treat symmetry discovery and dynamic learning as separate tasks, leading to limited expressiveness and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose the Latent Mixture of Symmetries (Latent MoS), an expressive model that captures a mixture of symmetry-governed latent factors from complex dynamical measurements. Latent MoS focuses on dynamic learning while locally and provably preserving the underlying symmetric transformations. To further capture long-term equivariance, we introduce a hierarchical architecture that stacks MoS blocks. Numerical experiments in diverse physical systems demonstrate that Latent MoS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in interpolation and extrapolation tasks while offering interpretable latent representations suitable for future geometric and safety-critical analyses.

arXiv:2510.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.

Abstract: We address the challenge of coordinating multiple robots in narrow and confined environments, where congestion and interference often hinder collective task performance. Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which achieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting environmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local and social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without explicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations of existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum learning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder sub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most effective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into asymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group performance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in nature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent coordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.

Abstract: The rising aging population has increased the importance of fall detection (FD) systems as an assistive technology, where deep learning techniques are widely applied to enhance accuracy. FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs) worn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud center (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges such as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between EDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a multilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC splits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If front-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a station with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD) approach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing high-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences, enhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation results demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the SisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also reduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on the SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD system exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines plays a vital role in predictive maintenance, ensuring operational safety and efficiency in aviation. Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation (DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data, and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced, organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied), alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL prediction for turbofan engines.

Abstract: This paper introduces Hill-ADAM. Hill-ADAM is an optimizer with its focus towards escaping local minima in prescribed loss landscapes to find the global minimum. Hill-ADAM escapes minima by deterministically exploring the state space. This eliminates uncertainty from random gradient updates in stochastic algorithms while seldom converging at the first minimum that visits. In the paper we first derive an analytical approximation of the ADAM Optimizer step size at a particular model state. From there define the primary condition determining ADAM limitations in escaping local minima. The proposed optimizer algorithm Hill-ADAM alternates between error minimization and maximization. It maximizes to escape the local minimum and minimizes again afterward. This alternation provides an overall exploration throughout the loss space. This allows the deduction of the global minimum's state. Hill-ADAM was tested with 5 loss functions and 12 amber-saturated to cooler-shade image color correction instances.

Abstract: We present Neural Bayesian Filtering (NBF), an algorithm for maintaining distributions over hidden states, called beliefs, in partially observable systems. NBF is trained to find a good latent representation of the beliefs induced by a task. It maps beliefs to fixed-length embedding vectors, which condition generative models for sampling. During filtering, particle-style updates compute posteriors in this embedding space using incoming observations and the environment's dynamics. NBF combines the computational efficiency of classical filters with the expressiveness of deep generative models - tracking rapidly shifting, multimodal beliefs while mitigating the risk of particle impoverishment. We validate NBF in state estimation tasks in three partially observable environments.

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term stock price movement remains a challenging task due to the market's inherent volatility and sensitivity to investor sentiment. This paper discusses a deep learning framework that integrates emotion features extracted from tweet data with historical stock price information to forecast significant price changes on the following day. We utilize Meta's Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model to preprocess tweet data, thereby enhancing the quality of emotion features derived from three emotion analysis approaches: a transformer-based DistilRoBERTa classifier from the Hugging Face library and two lexicon-based methods using National Research Council Canada (NRC) resources. These features are combined with previous-day stock price data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Experimental results on TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN stocks show that all three emotion analysis methods improve the average accuracy for predicting significant price movements, compared to the baseline model using only historical stock prices, which yields an accuracy of 13.5%. The DistilRoBERTa-based stock prediction model achieves the best performance, with accuracy rising from 23.6% to 38.5% when using LLaMA-enhanced emotion analysis. These results demonstrate that using large language models to preprocess tweet content enhances the effectiveness of emotion analysis which in turn improves the accuracy of predicting significant stock price movements.

Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small adversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and randomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these minor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in up to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied, which filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and sentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%, and logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the defense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings extend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes setting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and potential defenses for robust LLM deployment. This study also highlights the fragility of ICL under attack and the value of spectral defenses in making AI systems more reliable for health-related social media monitoring.

<title>Implicit Models: Expressive Power Scales with Test-Time Compute</title>

Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective treatment for Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent research uses reinforcement learning (RL) for DBS, with RL agents modulating the stimulation frequency and amplitude. But, these models rely on biomarkers that are not measurable in patients and are only present in brain-on-chip (BoC) simulations. In this work, we present an RL-based DBS approach that adapts these stimulation parameters according to brain activity measurable in vivo. Using a TD3 based RL agent trained on a model of the basal ganglia region of the brain, we see a greater suppression of biomarkers correlated with PD severity compared to modern clinical DBS implementations. Our agent outperforms the standard clinical approaches in suppressing PD biomarkers while relying on information that can be measured in a real world environment, thereby opening up the possibility of training personalized RL agents specific to individual patient needs.

<title>SAFA-SNN: Sparsity-Aware On-Device Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Fast-Adaptive Structure of Spiking Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Continuous learning of novel classes is crucial for edge devices to preserve data privacy and maintain reliable performance in dynamic environments. However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture, and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods, specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with practical implementation.

Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

<title>Optimising Battery Energy Storage System Trading via Energy Market Operator Price Forecast</title>

Abstract: In electricity markets around the world, the ability to anticipate price movements with precision can be the difference between profit and loss, especially for fast-acting assets like battery energy storage systems (BESS). As grid volatility increases due to renewables and market decentralisation, operators and forecasters alike face growing pressure to transform prediction into strategy. Yet while forecast data is abundant, especially in advanced markets like Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), its practical value in driving real-world BESS trading decisions remains largely unexplored. This thesis dives into that gap. This work addresses a key research question: Can the accuracy of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) energy price forecasts be systematically leveraged to develop a reliable and profitable battery energy storage system trading algorithm? Despite the availability of AEMO price forecasts, no existing framework evaluates their reliability or incorporates them into practical BESS trading strategies. By analysing patterns in forecast accuracy based on time of day, forecast horizon, and regional variations, this project creates a novel, forecast-informed BESS trading model to optimise arbitrage financial returns. The performance of this forecast-driven algorithm is benchmarked against a basic trading algorithm with no knowledge of forecast data. The study further explores the potential of machine learning techniques to predict future energy prices by enhancing AEMO forecasts to govern a more advanced trading strategy. The research outcomes will inform future improvements in energy market trading models and promote more efficient BESS integration into market operations.

<title>Does higher interpretability imply better utility? A Pairwise Analysis on Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models (LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility? To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B, Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels, and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench (arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298), indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52 percent compared to the current best output score based criterion (arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering features.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) in consumer applications has led to frequent exchanges of personal information. To obtain useful responses, users often share more than necessary, increasing privacy risks via memorization, context-based personalization, or security breaches. We present a framework to formally define and operationalize data minimization: for a given user prompt and response model, quantifying the least privacy-revealing disclosure that maintains utility, and we propose a priority-queue tree search to locate this optimal point within a privacy-ordered transformation space. We evaluated the framework on four datasets spanning open-ended conversations (ShareGPT, WildChat) and knowledge-intensive tasks with single-ground-truth answers (CaseHold, MedQA), quantifying achievable data minimization with nine LLMs as the response model. Our results demonstrate that larger frontier LLMs can tolerate stronger data minimization while maintaining task quality than smaller open-source models (85.7% redaction for GPT-5 vs. 19.3% for Qwen2.5-0.5B). By comparing with our search-derived benchmarks, we find that LLMs struggle to predict optimal data minimization directly, showing a bias toward abstraction that leads to oversharing. This suggests not just a privacy gap, but a capability gap: models may lack awareness of what information they actually need to solve a task.

<title>Token Hidden Reward: Steering Exploration-Exploitation in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: This paper studies the computational challenges of large-scale attention-based models in artificial intelligence by utilizing importance sampling methods in the streaming setting. Inspired by the classical definition of the $\ell_2$ sampler and the recent progress of the attention scheme in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose the definition of the attention sampler. Our approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional attention mechanisms. We analyze the effectiveness of the attention sampler from a theoretical perspective, including space and update time. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability and broad applicability across various model architectures and domains.

Abstract: We introduce Group Policy Gradient (GPG), a family of critic-free policy-gradient estimators for general MDPs. Inspired by the success of GRPO's approach in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), GPG replaces a learned value function with a group-based Monte Carlo advantage estimator, removing the memory, compute, and hyperparameter costs of training a critic while preserving PPO's clipped-objective structure. We prove the consistency of the GPG estimator, analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs, and demonstrate empirically that GPG matches or outperforms PPO on standard benchmarks. GPG makes better use of parallel simulations, which, together with its critic-free design, results in more efficient use of computational resources than PPO.

<title>From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.

arXiv:2510.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizers are crucial for the efficient training of Large Language Models (LLMs). While AdamW is the de facto standard, recent structure-aware optimizers like Muon have emerged, which regularize gradient updates by operating on entire weight matrices. The Muon optimizer balances the gradient updates along all the directions. However, Muon's reliance on the matrix sign function can lead to training instability, exhibits incompatibility when fine-tuning models pre-trained with AdamW. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REG}, a novel optimizer that replaces Muon's aggressive matrix sign operator with the Row-and-Column-Scaling (RACS) operator. Theoretically grounded in balancing a matrix, the RACS operator regularizes the update steps in a less drastic manner, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with established training dynamics. Through extensive empirical experiments on LLM training, we demonstrate that our REG optimizer not only achieves superior performance and stability over AdamW, but also maintains consistency with the AdamW training paradigm. This consistency is particularly evident during the fine-tuning stage, where REG optimizer avoids the performance degradation observed with Muon.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to sequential decision making, where interpretability and performance are both critical for practical adoption. Current approaches typically focus on performance and rely on post hoc explanations to account for interpretability. Different from these approaches, we focus on designing an interpretability-oriented yet performance-enhanced RL approach. Specifically, we propose a spectral based linear RL method that extends the ridge regression-based approach through a spectral filter function. The proposed method clarifies the role of regularization in controlling estimation error and further enables the design of an adaptive regularization parameter selection strategy guided by the bias-variance trade-off principle. Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal bounds for both parameter estimation and generalization error. Extensive experiments on simulated environments and real-world datasets from Kuaishou and Taobao demonstrate that our method either outperforms or matches existing baselines in decision quality. We also conduct interpretability analyses to illustrate how the learned policies make decisions, thereby enhancing user trust. These results highlight the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between RL theory and practical decision making, providing interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in management contexts.

Abstract: Federated learning has received significant attention for its ability to simultaneously protect customer privacy and leverage distributed data from multiple devices for model training. However, conventional approaches often focus on isolated heterogeneous scenarios, resulting in skewed feature distributions or label distributions. Meanwhile, data heterogeneity is actually a key factor in improving model performance. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called PFPL in mixed heterogeneous scenarios. The method provides richer domain knowledge and unbiased convergence targets by constructing personalized, unbiased prototypes for each client. Moreover, in the local update phase, we introduce consistent regularization to align local instances with their personalized prototypes, which significantly improves the convergence of the loss function. Experimental results on Digits and Office Caltech datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach and successfully reduce the communication cost.

Abstract: The rapid development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has noticeably improved the efficiency of adapting large language models. Among these, LoRA has gained widespread popularity due to its strong balance of effectiveness and parameter efficiency. However, LoRA relies on initializing two low-rank matrices whose product is zero, which limits its ability to effectively activate and leverage the original model weights-creating a potential bottleneck for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{IniLoRA}, a novel initialization strategy that initializes the low-rank matrices to closely approximate the original model weights. Experimental results indicate that IniLoRA achieves better performance than LoRA across a range of models and tasks. Additionally, we introduce two variants, IniLoRA-$\alpha$ and IniLoRA-$\beta$, both leveraging distinct initialization methods to enhance performance further.

Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of audit cost.

Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles, regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement, frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance, flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment, augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter / LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a ~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818, improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.

Abstract: Low-discrepancy points are designed to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in science and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. Whereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra and number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced to exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower discrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating point sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e., sequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property essential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based framework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train a neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences exhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes. To this end, we deploy a two-stage learning process: supervised approximation of classical constructions followed by unsupervised fine-tuning to minimize prefix discrepancies. We demonstrate that $NeuroLDS$ outperforms all previous LDS constructions by a significant margin with respect to discrepancy measures. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of $NeuroLDS$ across diverse applications, including numerical integration, robot motion planning, and scientific machine learning. These results highlight the promise and broad significance of Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences. Our code can be found at https://github.com/camail-official/neuro-lds.

  Despite the promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating kernel optimization, this field suffers from a fragmented ecosystem of isolated and incomparable approaches with unclear problem formulations.
  Furthermore, general-purpose LLM code evolution methods cannot meet strict correctness requirements of CUDA kernel optimization.
  We address these fundamental challenges by first formalizing CUDA kernel optimization as a code optimization task with a clear objective, constraints, and evaluation metrics.
  We then establish the first systematic LLM-based code evolution framework, EvoEngineer, that provides guidance for designing and adapting optimization strategies to achieve a balance between performance and correctness.
  Finally, we implement a kernel optimization system based on this framework and conduct extensive experiments on 91 real-world CUDA kernels.
  Our results demonstrate that EvoEngineer achieves a principled balance between performance and correctness, with the highest averaged median speedup of \textbf{2.72}$\times$ over baseline CUDA kernels and a code validity rate of \textbf{69.8}\%, outperforming existing methods on both dimensions.
  Our method achieves a maximum speedup of \textbf{36.75}$\times$ among all operations over PyTorch kernels and delivers the highest speedup on \textbf{28} (\textbf{56.0\%}) of 50 operations that achieve over \textbf{2$\times$} acceleration.

Abstract: Adapting to diverse user needs at test time is a key challenge in controllable multi-objective generation. Existing methods are insufficient: merging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter level, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While decoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating logits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and relying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we introduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model merging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem between the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by dynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone models that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and implicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the decoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship between model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced controllability afforded by our approach. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior controllability, Pareto-optimal performance, and enhanced adaptability.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable successes across a wide range of applications, yet the theoretical foundation of their model efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how the model parameters -- mainly attention heads and head dimensions -- should be allocated across layers to balance expressivity and efficiency. We first provide mathematical analysis on the role of early layers in information extraction from an approximation perspective, with a theoretical characterization on the trade-off between the number of heads and head dimension under a fixed parameter budget. In addition, we uncover and prove the \emph{saturation} behavior of softmax activations: Continuously increasing head dimensions can lead to diminishing returns in learning errors, particularly for long sequences. Supported by both theory and experiments, this saturation pattern suggests that later layers can operate more efficiently with reduced parameters. Combining these insights, we propose principled strategies for allocating attention heads and dimensions across Transformers' layers, shedding light on theoretically-grounded model efficiency of Transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: The batched multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which rewards are collected in batches, is crucial for applications such as clinical trials. Existing research predominantly assumes light-tailed reward distributions, yet many real-world scenarios, including clinical outcomes, exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics. This paper bridges this gap by proposing robust batched bandit algorithms designed for heavy-tailed rewards, within both finite-arm and Lipschitz-continuous settings. We reveal a surprising phenomenon: in the instance-independent regime, as well as in the Lipschitz setting, heavier-tailed rewards necessitate a smaller number of batches to achieve near-optimal regret. In stark contrast, for the instance-dependent setting, the required number of batches to attain near-optimal regret remains invariant with respect to tail heaviness.

Abstract: Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution sequences.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications, and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics could be gained through our method.

Abstract: On-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most important token logits to balance computational cost and projection effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language Models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across datasets, model families, and advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final success rates.

Abstract: High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state, environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric deterministic method for distributed area coverage, validating the MARL approach and providing a foundation for more complex autonomous multi-HAB missions where deterministic methods become intractable.

Abstract: The task of learning a diffusion-based neural sampler for drawing samples from an unnormalized target distribution can be viewed as a stochastic optimal control problem on path measures. However, the training of neural samplers can be challenging when the target distribution is multimodal with significant barriers separating the modes, potentially leading to mode collapse. We propose a framework named \textbf{Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler (PDNS)} that addresses these challenges by tackling the stochastic optimal control problem via proximal point method on the space of path measures. PDNS decomposes the learning process into a series of simpler subproblems that create a path gradually approaching the desired distribution. This staged procedure traces a progressively refined path to the desired distribution and promotes thorough exploration across modes. For a practical and efficient realization, we instantiate each proximal step with a proximal weighted denoising cross-entropy (WDCE) objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PDNS through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete sampling tasks, including challenging scenarios in molecular dynamics and statistical physics.

<title>HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control</title>

Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.

Abstract: When training data are fragmented across batches or federated-learned across different geographic locations, trained models manifest performance degradation. That degradation partly owes to covariate shift induced by data having been fragmented across time and space and producing dissimilar empirical training distributions. Each fragment's distribution is slightly different to a hypothetical unfragmented training distribution of covariates, and to the single validation distribution. To address this problem, we propose Fisher Information for Robust fEderated validation (\textbf{FIRE}). This method accumulates fragmentation-induced covariate shift divergences from the global training distribution via an approximate Fisher information. That term, which we prove to be a more computationally-tractable estimate, is then used as a per-fragment loss penalty, enabling scalable distribution alignment. FIRE outperforms importance weighting benchmarks by $5.1\%$ at maximum and federated learning (FL) benchmarks by up to $5.3\%$ on shifted validation sets.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for M-FISHER, a method for sequential distribution shift detection and stable adaptation in streaming data. For detection, we construct an exponential martingale from non-conformity scores and apply Ville's inequality to obtain time-uniform guarantees on false alarm control, ensuring statistical validity at any stopping time. Under sustained shifts, we further bound the expected detection delay as $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\delta)/\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ reflects the post-shift information gain, thereby linking detection efficiency to distributional divergence. For adaptation, we show that Fisher-preconditioned updates of prompt parameters implement natural gradient descent on the distributional manifold, yielding locally optimal updates that minimize KL divergence while preserving stability and parameterization invariance. Together, these results establish M-FISHER as a principled approach for robust, anytime-valid detection and geometrically stable adaptation in sequential decision-making under covariate shift.

<title>On Using Large Language Models to Enhance Clinically-Driven Missing Data Recovery Algorithms in Electronic Health Records</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03844</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and errors. Previously, we devised an "enriched" chart review protocol where a "roadmap" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients, we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more, missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap. Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing EHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to large samples. Extending them to monitor other dimensions of data quality (e.g., plausability) is a promising future direction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The recently introduced optimizer, Muon, has gained increasing attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of applications. However, its effectiveness in federated learning remains unexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the performance of Muon in the federated learning setting. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, FedMuon, and establish its convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals multiple favorable properties of FedMuon. In particular, due to its orthonormalized update direction, the learning rate of FedMuon is independent of problem-specific parameters, and, importantly, it can naturally accommodate heavy-tailed noise. The extensive experiments on a variety of neural network architectures validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. Using the Scion optimizer, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and dataset sizes is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are consistent with those of the Adam optimizer. Tuning per-layer-group learning rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support research on LLM training dynamics at scale.

Abstract: Optimal design under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in advancing reliable, next-generation process systems. Robust optimization (RO) offers a principled approach by safeguarding against worst-case scenarios across a range of uncertain parameters. However, traditional RO methods typically require known problem structure, which limits their applicability to high-fidelity simulation environments. To overcome these limitations, recent work has explored robust Bayesian optimization (RBO) as a flexible alternative that can accommodate expensive, black-box objectives. Existing RBO methods, however, generally ignore available structural information and struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce BONSAI (Bayesian Optimization of Network Systems under uncertAInty), a new RBO framework that leverages partial structural knowledge commonly available in simulation-based models. Instead of treating the objective as a monolithic black box, BONSAI represents it as a directed graph of interconnected white- and black-box components, allowing the algorithm to utilize intermediate information within the optimization process. We further propose a scalable Thompson sampling-based acquisition function tailored to the structured RO setting, which can be efficiently optimized using gradient-based methods. We evaluate BONSAI across a diverse set of synthetic and real-world case studies, including applications in process systems engineering. Compared to existing simulation-based RO algorithms, BONSAI consistently delivers more sample-efficient and higher-quality robust solutions, highlighting its practical advantages for uncertainty-aware design in complex engineering systems.

<title>LLM as an Algorithmist: Enhancing Anomaly Detectors via Programmatic Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods for tabular data usually rely on some assumptions about anomaly patterns, leading to inconsistent performance in real-world scenarios. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable reasoning capabilities, their direct application to tabular AD is impeded by fundamental challenges, including difficulties in processing heterogeneous data and significant privacy risks. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor'' to an ``algorithmist''. Instead of being exposed to raw data, our framework leverages the LLM's ability to reason about algorithms. It analyzes a high-level description of a given detector to understand its intrinsic weaknesses and then generates detector-specific, data-agnostic Python code to synthesize ``hard-to-detect'' anomalies that exploit these vulnerabilities. This generated synthesis program, which is reusable across diverse datasets, is then instantiated to augment training data, systematically enhancing the detector's robustness by transforming the problem into a more discriminative two-class classification task. Extensive experiments on 36 TAD benchmarks show that LLM-DAS consistently boosts the performance of mainstream detectors. By bridging LLM reasoning with classic AD algorithms via programmatic synthesis, LLM-DAS offers a scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving approach to patching the logical blind spots of existing detectors.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection forms a very crucial area in several domains but poses substantial challenges. Due to time series data possessing seasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes very difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior. Anomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to contextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the dataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to the problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time detection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving at results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges, very strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper presents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that exploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts embeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and applies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral Decomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data. Our experiments show that this modular method achieves SOTA results on the MSL dataset and performs quite competitively on the SMAP and SWAT$^*$ datasets. Notably, THEMIS exceeds models trained specifically for anomaly detection, presenting hyperparameter robustness and interpretability by default. This paper advocates for pretrained representations from foundation models for performing efficient and adaptable anomaly detection for time series data.

Abstract: This paper focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) with clustered data, which is commonly encountered in healthcare applications. We propose a generalized fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithm that incorporates generalized estimating equations into policy learning to handle the intra-cluster correlations. Theoretically, we demonstrate (i) the optimalities of our Q-function and policy estimators when the correlation structure is correctly specified, and (ii) their consistencies when the structure is mis-specified. Empirically, through simulations and analyses of a mobile health dataset, we find the proposed generalized FQI achieves, on average, a half reduction in regret compared to the standard FQI.

Abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study online regression when the learner has access to predictions about future examples. In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the sequence of examples is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For this setting, we fully characterize the minimax expected regret in terms of the fat-shattering dimension, establishing a separation between transductive online regression and (adversarial) online regression. Then, we generalize this setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions about future examples. Using our results for the transductive online setting, we develop an online learner whose minimax expected regret matches the worst-case regret, improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the worst-case regret when future example predictions are precise, achieving performance similar to the transductive online learner. This enables learnability for previously unlearnable classes under predictable examples, aligning with the broader learning-augmented model paradigm.

Abstract: Continuous-depth graph neural networks, also known as Graph Neural Differential Equations (GNDEs), combine the structural inductive bias of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the continuous-depth architecture of Neural ODEs, offering a scalable and principled framework for modeling dynamics on graphs. In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from $\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly. Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification, summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and a foundation for ensemble recommendation.

<title>On the Empirical Power of Goodness-of-Fit Tests in Watermark Detection</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) raise concerns about content authenticity and integrity because they can generate human-like text at scale. Text watermarks, which embed detectable statistical signals into generated text, offer a provable way to verify content origin. Many detection methods rely on pivotal statistics that are i.i.d. under human-written text, making goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests a natural tool for watermark detection. However, GoF tests remain largely underexplored in this setting. In this paper, we systematically evaluate eight GoF tests across three popular watermarking schemes, using three open-source LLMs, two datasets, various generation temperatures, and multiple post-editing methods. We find that general GoF tests can improve both the detection power and robustness of watermark detectors. Notably, we observe that text repetition, common in low-temperature settings, gives GoF tests a unique advantage not exploited by existing methods. Our results highlight that classic GoF tests are a simple yet powerful and underused tool for watermark detection in LLMs.

<title>What Is The Performance Ceiling of My Classifier? Utilizing Category-Wise Influence Functions for Pareto Frontier Analysis</title>

Abstract: Data-centric learning seeks to improve model performance from the perspective of data quality, and has been drawing increasing attention in the machine learning community. Among its key tools, influence functions provide a powerful framework to quantify the impact of individual training samples on model predictions, enabling practitioners to identify detrimental samples and retrain models on a cleaner dataset for improved performance. However, most existing work focuses on the question: "what data benefits the learning model?" In this paper, we take a step further and investigate a more fundamental question: "what is the performance ceiling of the learning model?" Unlike prior studies that primarily measure improvement through overall accuracy, we emphasize category-wise accuracy and aim for Pareto improvements, ensuring that every class benefits, rather than allowing tradeoffs where some classes improve at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose category-wise influence functions and introduce an influence vector that quantifies the impact of each training sample across all categories. Leveraging these influence vectors, we develop a principled criterion to determine whether a model can still be improved, and further design a linear programming-based sample reweighting framework to achieve Pareto performance improvements. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, vision, and text benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating and achieving a model's performance improvement across multiple categories of interest.

<title>Optimizing Resources for On-the-Fly Label Estimation with Multiple Unknown Medical Experts</title>

Abstract: Accurate ground truth estimation in medical screening programs often relies on coalitions of experts and peer second opinions. Algorithms that efficiently aggregate noisy annotations can enhance screening workflows, particularly when data arrive continuously and expert proficiency is initially unknown. However, existing algorithms do not meet the requirements for seamless integration into screening pipelines. We therefore propose an adaptive approach for real-time annotation that (I) supports on-the-fly labeling of incoming data, (II) operates without prior knowledge of medical experts or pre-labeled data, and (III) dynamically queries additional experts based on the latent difficulty of each instance. The method incrementally gathers expert opinions until a confidence threshold is met, providing accurate labels with reduced annotation overhead. We evaluate our approach on three multi-annotator classification datasets across different modalities. Results show that our adaptive querying strategy reduces the number of expert queries by up to 50% while achieving accuracy comparable to a non-adaptive baseline.

<title>Early-Warning of Thunderstorm-Driven Power Outages with a Two-Stage Machine Learning Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03959</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thunderstorm-driven outages are difficult to predict because most storms do not cause damage, convective processes occur rapidly and chaotically, and the available public data are both noisy and incomplete. We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap.
  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields, such as healthcare and internet traffic monitoring. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences, as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.

<title>What Can You Do When You Have Zero Rewards During RL?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based rewards has proven effective for improving large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, its success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct solutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a zero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this scenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and evaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense rewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments show that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base model never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple data-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables the model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero reward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself. Because official implementations of several baselines were unavailable, we developed our own, which allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of their failure modes. We release these implementations to support further research at: https://github.com/rl4reasoning/rl-baselines

Abstract: We establish a link between a class of discrete choice models and the theory of online learning and multi-armed bandits. Our contributions are: (i) sublinear regret bounds for a broad algorithmic family, encompassing Exp3 as a special case; (ii) a new class of adversarial bandit algorithms derived from generalized nested logit models \citep{wen:2001}; and (iii) \textcolor{black}{we introduce a novel class of generalized gradient bandit algorithms that extends beyond the widely used softmax formulation. By relaxing the restrictive independence assumptions inherent in softmax, our framework accommodates correlated learning dynamics across actions, thereby broadening the applicability of gradient bandit methods.} Overall, the proposed algorithms combine flexible model specification with computational efficiency via closed-form sampling probabilities. Numerical experiments in stochastic bandit settings demonstrate their practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Hierarchical Pooling Models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying graph-structured data. While numerous innovative methods have been proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity, resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation. Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural network architectures.

<title>Distilling Reasoning into Student LLMs: Local Naturalness for Selecting Teacher Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03988</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling long reasoning traces (10K+ tokens) from stronger teacher models into smaller student LLMs via SFT has emerged as a standard paradigm. This approach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating abundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven way to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has largely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the equally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher outputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge becomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may benefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with a systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first show that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the highest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come from multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with downstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers become longer. To overcome this problem, we introduce Local Naturalness, which measures the student's log-probabilities over short, sequential reasoning steps conditioned only on a small local window. Local Naturalness enables two applications: 1) Teacher Selection: Aggregating local scores across prompts reliably identifies the most helpful teacher. 2) Response Selection from a Multiple Teachers: When mixing answers from many teachers, Local Naturalness boosts a 32B student's accuracy on math benchmarks by 9.4pp over global selection, also surpassing the performance achieved by training on data from the single best teacher. These results highlight the power of localized data quality evaluation and data mixing for more effective reasoning distillation.

<title>A Mathematical Explanation of Transformers for Large Language Models and GPTs</title>

arXiv:2510.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of sequence modeling and underpins the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs). However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its structure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel continuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a discretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this formulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local integral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to a time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational perspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the architecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and normalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by embedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token indices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible framework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new directions for architecture design, analysis, and control-based interpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the gap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling, and contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of interpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.

Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting, leading to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss. Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources, enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.

<title>Replacing Softmax Similarity with a Sharpened Angular Similarity: Theory and Practice of Scaling To Billion-Context Attention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity, which becomes prohibitive to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example, FlashAttention (an exact, GPU-optimized implementation of Softmax Attention) cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a multi-head attention layer once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We introduce RACE Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention that is linear in sequence length and embedding dimension. RACE Attention replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular (cosine) similarity, and approximates attention outputs via randomized projections and soft Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Across language modeling, masked language modeling, and text classification, RACE Attention matches the accuracy of strong baselines while reducing runtime and memory. In a controlled scale test, it processes up to 12 million tokens during a single forward-backward pass on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU, well beyond the practical limits of the current state-of-the-art attention implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical, theoretically grounded mechanism for outrageously long context windows on today's hardware. We hope that it gets adopted in practice.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g. reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and 1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO. Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: To address the dual challenges of inherent stochasticity and non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP), a new paradigm grounded in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. SFP constructs a novel Generative World Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an "imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing extreme events.

Abstract: With the increasing need to safeguard data privacy in machine learning models, differential privacy (DP) is one of the major frameworks to build privacy-preserving models. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used traditional machine learning models due to their robust margin guarantees and strong empirical performance in binary classification. However, applying DP to multi-class SVMs is inadequate, as the standard one-versus-rest (OvR) and one-versus-one (OvO) approaches repeatedly query each data sample when building multiple binary classifiers, thus consuming the privacy budget proportionally to the number of classes. To overcome this limitation, we explore all-in-one SVM approaches for DP, which access each data sample only once to construct multi-class SVM boundaries with margin maximization properties. We propose a novel differentially Private Multi-class SVM (PMSVM) with weight and gradient perturbation methods, providing rigorous sensitivity and convergence analyses to ensure DP in all-in-one SVMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing DP-SVM methods in multi-class scenarios.

<title>The Debate on RLVR Reasoning Capability Boundary: Shrinkage, Expansion, or Both? A Two-Stage Dynamic View</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves sampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity, resulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate that prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning strategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both perspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an inherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially, the model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while rarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates increase the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward tokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during this stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of previously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach saturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage estimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of the originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that over-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary shrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an expansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we revisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging training, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development of more advanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world binary classification tasks, often leading to predictions biased toward the majority class and reduced recognition of the minority class. This issue is particularly critical in domains such as medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, where correct classification of minority classes is essential. Conventional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance when the imbalance ratio is extremely severe. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Kernel-density-Oriented Threshold Adjustment with Regional Optimization (KOTARO), which extends the framework of kernel density estimation (KDE) by adaptively adjusting decision boundaries according to local sample density. In KOTARO, the bandwidth of Gaussian basis functions is dynamically tuned based on the estimated density around each sample, thereby enhancing the classifier's ability to capture minority regions. We validated the effectiveness of KOTARO through experiments on both synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets. The results demonstrated that KOTARO outperformed conventional methods, particularly under conditions of severe imbalance, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for a wide range of imbalanced classification problems

<title>Variational Diffusion Unlearning: A Variational Inference Framework for Unlearning in Diffusion Models under Data Constraints</title>

Abstract: For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains, regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model

<title>What Scales in Cross-Entropy Scaling Law?</title>

Abstract: The cross-entropy scaling law has long served as a key tool for guiding the development of large language models. It shows that cross-entropy loss decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However, recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead, only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy, Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and future development of large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.

Abstract: This article introduces the theory of offline reinforcement learning in large state spaces, where good policies are learned from historical data without online interactions with the environment. Key concepts introduced include expressivity assumptions on function approximation (e.g., Bellman completeness vs. realizability) and data coverage (e.g., all-policy vs. single-policy coverage). A rich landscape of algorithms and results is described, depending on the assumptions one is willing to make and the sample and computational complexity guarantees one wishes to achieve. We also discuss open questions and connections to adjacent areas.

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN) training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating versatility of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning and complementary multi-label learning are two popular weakly supervised multi-label classification paradigms that aim to alleviate the high annotation costs of collecting precisely annotated multi-label data. In partial multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with a candidate label set, among which only some labels are relevant; in complementary multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with complementary labels indicating the classes to which the instance does not belong. Existing consistent approaches for the two paradigms either require accurate estimation of the generation process of candidate or complementary labels or assume a uniform distribution to eliminate the estimation problem. However, both conditions are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose consistent approaches that do not rely on the aforementioned conditions to handle both problems in a unified way. Specifically, we propose two unbiased risk estimators based on first- and second-order strategies. Theoretically, we prove consistency w.r.t. two widely used multi-label classification evaluation metrics and derive convergence rates for the estimation errors of the proposed risk estimators. Empirically, extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.

Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is a critical concern, yet most research has focused on classification tasks, leaving regression models underexplored. This paper introduces a Wasserstein projection-based framework for fairness testing in regression models, focusing on expectation-based criteria. We propose a hypothesis-testing approach and an optimal data perturbation method to improve fairness while balancing accuracy. Theoretical results include a detailed categorization of fairness criteria for regression, a dual reformulation of the Wasserstein projection test statistic, and the derivation of asymptotic bounds and limiting distributions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method offers higher specificity compared to permutation-based tests, and effectively detects and mitigates biases in real applications such as student performance and housing price prediction.

Abstract: Semiautomata form a rich class of sequence-processing algorithms with applications in natural language processing, robotics, computational biology, and data mining. We establish the first Statistical Query hardness result for semiautomata under the uniform distribution over input words and initial states. We show that Statistical Query hardness can be established when both the alphabet size and input length are polynomial in the number of states. Unlike the case of deterministic finite automata, where hardness typically arises through the hardness of the language they recognize (e.g., parity), our result is derived solely from the internal state-transition structure of semiautomata. Our analysis reduces the task of distinguishing the final states of two semiautomata to studying the behavior of a random walk on the group $S_{N} \times S_{N}$. By applying tools from Fourier analysis and the representation theory of the symmetric group, we obtain tight spectral gap bounds, demonstrating that after a polynomial number of steps in the number of states, distinct semiautomata become nearly uncorrelated, yielding the desired hardness result.

Abstract: Cold-start drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction focuses on interaction between novel drugs and proteins. Previous methods typically learn transferable interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it. However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary) and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors, avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.

Abstract: In Transformers, Position Embeddings (PEs) significantly influence Length Generalization (LG) performance, yet their fundamental role remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the limitations and capabilities of PEs in achieving LG. We theoretically analyze PEs in Position-Only Linear Attentions (POLAs), introducing Linear Representation Complexity (LRC) to characterize when PEs enable LG. Our analysis shows that PEs do not expand computational capabilities but structure learned computations across positions. Extending to practical Transformers, we propose Sequential Representation Complexity (SRC) and conjecture that LG is possible if and only if SRC remains invariant across scales. We support this hypothesis with empirical evidence in various reasoning tasks. To enhance LG, we introduce Scale Hint, allowing flexible instance scaling, and a Learning-Based Position Embedding framework that automatically learns positional relations. Our work provides theoretical insights and practical strategies for improving LG in Transformers.

Abstract: Neural ODEs (NODEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling time series data, offering the flexibility to adapt to varying input scales and capture complex dynamics. However, they face significant challenges: first, their reliance on time-domain representations often limits their ability to capture long-term dependencies and periodic structures; second, the inherent mismatch between their continuous-time formulation and the discrete nature of real-world data can lead to loss of granularity and predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose Fourier Ordinary Differential Equations (FODEs), an approach that embeds the dynamics in the Fourier domain. By transforming time-series data into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), FODEs uncover global patterns and periodic behaviors that remain elusive in the time domain. Additionally, we introduce a learnable element-wise filtering mechanism that aligns continuous model outputs with discrete observations, preserving granularity and enhancing accuracy. Experiments on various time series datasets demonstrate that FODEs outperform existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. By effectively capturing both long- and short-term patterns, FODEs provide a robust framework for modeling time series dynamics.

Abstract: Periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of time series data and has long played a central role in forecasting. Recent deep learning methods strengthen the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution, PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets, where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/neumyor/PhaseFormer_TSL

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) have garnered significant attention for their design of continuous-depth neural networks and the ability to learn data/feature dynamics. However, for high-dimensional systems, estimating dynamics requires extensive calculations and suffers from high truncation errors for the ODE solvers. To address the issue, one intuitive approach is to consider the non-trivial topological space of the data distribution, i.e., a low-dimensional manifold. Existing methods often rely on knowledge of the manifold for projection or implicit transformation, restricting the ODE solutions on the manifold. Nevertheless, such knowledge is usually unknown in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to explore the underlying manifold to restrict the ODE process. Specifically, we employ a structure-preserved encoder to process data and find the underlying graph to approximate the manifold. Moreover, we propose novel methods to combine the NODE learning with the manifold, resulting in significant gains in computational speed and accuracy. Our experimental evaluations encompass multiple datasets, where we compare the accuracy, number of function evaluations (NFEs), and convergence speed of our model against existing baselines. Our results demonstrate superior performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of high-dimensional datasets.

<title>Beyond Next-Token Prediction: A Performance Characterization of Diffusion versus Autoregressive Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved latency relative to ARMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly focused on non-asymptotic convergence analyses for actor-critic (AC) algorithms. One such effort introduced a two-timescale critic-actor algorithm for the discounted cost setting using a tabular representation, where the usual roles of the actor and critic are reversed. However, only asymptotic convergence was established there. Subsequently, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses of the critic-actor algorithm with linear function approximation were conducted. In our work, we introduce the first natural critic-actor algorithm with function approximation for the long-run average cost setting and under inequality constraints. We provide the non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for this algorithm. Our analysis establishes optimal learning rates and we also propose a modification to enhance sample complexity. We further show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments where our algorithm is found to be competitive in comparison with other well known algorithms.

Abstract: Loss explosions in training deep neural networks can nullify multi-million dollar training runs. Conventional monitoring metrics like weight and gradient norms are often lagging and ambiguous predictors, as their values vary dramatically across different models and even between layers of the same model, making it difficult to establish a unified standard for detecting impending failure. We introduce Spectral Alignment (SA), a novel, theoretically-grounded metric that monitors the distributional alignment between layer inputs and the principal singular vectors of weight matrices. We show that a collapse in the sign diversity of this alignment is a powerful early predictor of representational collapse and training divergence. Empirical results on language models demonstrate that monitoring the SA distribution provides a significantly earlier and clearer warning of loss explosions than traditional scalar metrics. SA's low computational overhead makes it a practical tool for safeguarding model training.

Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is critical for stable and efficient convergence of heterogeneous federated learning, where clients differ in computational capabilities, and data distributions are non-IID. Tuning hyperparameters is a manual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows combinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an end-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central agents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters. Our approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to draw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this perspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the system for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and central servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from numerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated learning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are dynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By designing a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and central agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of heterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client drift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being insensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited for rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for heterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning both client and server updates.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering enhanced interpretability and a strong mathematical foundation. However, their parameter efficiency remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. This paper introduces PolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal guarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging the inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the compression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a rigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of $\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal compression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time complexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal foundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new directions for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures.

Abstract: The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to catastrophic loss explosions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a practical solution to this persistent problem.

<title>MLLMEraser: Achieving Test-Time Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models through Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization, but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

<title>Physics-Inspired All-Pair Interaction Learning for 3D Dynamics Modeling</title>

Abstract: Modeling 3D dynamics is a fundamental problem in multi-body systems across scientific and engineering domains and has important practical implications in trajectory prediction and simulation. While recent GNN-based approaches have achieved strong performance by enforcing geometric symmetries, encoding high-order features or incorporating neural-ODE mechanics, they typically depend on explicitly observed structures and inherently fail to capture the unobserved interactions that are crucial to complex physical behaviors and dynamics mechanism. In this paper, we propose PAINET, a principled SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for learning all-pair interactions in multi-body systems. The model comprises: (1) a novel physics-inspired attention network derived from the minimization trajectory of an energy function, and (2) a parallel decoder that preserves equivariance while enabling efficient inference. Empirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human motion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show that PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to 41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation costs in terms of time and memory.

<title>Truncated Kernel Stochastic Gradient Descent with General Losses and Spherical Radial Basis Functions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel kernel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for large-scale supervised learning with general losses. Compared to traditional kernel SGD, our algorithm improves efficiency and scalability through an innovative regularization strategy. By leveraging the infinite series expansion of spherical radial basis functions, this strategy projects the stochastic gradient onto a finite-dimensional hypothesis space, which is adaptively scaled according to the bias-variance trade-off, thereby enhancing generalization performance. Based on a new estimation of the spectral structure of the kernel-induced covariance operator, we develop an analytical framework that unifies optimization and generalization analyses. We prove that both the last iterate and the suffix average converge at minimax-optimal rates, and we further establish optimal strong convergence in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our framework accommodates a broad class of classical loss functions, including least-squares, Huber, and logistic losses. Moreover, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and achieves optimal storage complexity by incorporating coordinate-wise updates from linear SGD, thereby avoiding the costly pairwise operations typical of kernel SGD and enabling efficient processing of streaming data. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

<title>Diffusion-Assisted Distillation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning with MLPs</title>

Abstract: For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for \textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with \textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/DAD-SGM.

<title>Efficient Latent Variable Causal Discovery: Combining Score Search and Targeted Testing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04263</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but often performs exhaustive conditional independence tests across many subsets, leading to spurious independence claims, extra or missing edges, and unreliable orientations. We present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that build on this tradition. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI, straightforward variants of GFCI that substitute BOSS or GRaSP for FGES, thereby retaining correctness while incurring different scalability tradeoffs. Second, we develop FCI Targeted-testing (FCIT), a novel mixed-strategy method that improves upon these variants by replacing exhaustive all-subsets testing with targeted tests guided by BOSS, yielding well-formed PAGs with higher precision and efficiency. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic, LV-Dumb (also known as BOSS-POD), which bypasses latent-variable-specific reasoning and directly returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG. Although not strictly correct in the FCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice. Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI provide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and LV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance. Together, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted strategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.

Abstract: On the occasion of the 20th Mixed Integer Program Workshop's computational competition, this work introduces a new approach for learning to solve MIPs online. Influence branching, a new graph-oriented variable selection strategy, is applied throughout the first iterations of the branch and bound algorithm. This branching heuristic is optimized online with Thompson sampling, which ranks the best graph representations of MIP's structure according to computational speed up over SCIP. We achieve results comparable to state of the art online learning methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our method generalizes well to more general online frameworks, where variations in constraint matrix, constraint vector and objective coefficients can all occur and where more samples are available.

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization. However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC), a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.

<title>HoRA: Cross-Head Low-Rank Adaptation with Joint Hypernetworks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique that adapts large pre-trained models by adding low-rank matrices to their weight updates. However, in the context of fine-tuning multi-head self-attention (MHA), LoRA has been employed to adapt each attention head separately, thereby overlooking potential synergies across different heads. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Hyper-shared Low-Rank Adaptation (HoRA) method, which utilizes joint hypernetworks to generate low-rank matrices across attention heads. By coupling their adaptation through a shared generator, HoRA encourages cross-head information sharing, and thus directly addresses the aforementioned limitation of LoRA. By comparing LoRA and HoRA through the lens of hierarchical mixture of experts, our theoretical findings reveal that the latter achieves superior sample efficiency to the former. Furthermore, through extensive experiments across diverse language and vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that HoRA outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods while requiring only a marginal increase in the number of trainable parameters.

<title>Wave-PDE Nets: Trainable Wave-Equation Layers as an Alternative to Attention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Wave-PDE Nets, a neural architecture whose elementary operation is a differentiable simulation of the second-order wave equation. Each layer propagates its hidden state as a continuous field through a medium with trainable spatial velocity c(x) and damping {\gamma}(x). A symplectic spectral solver based on FFTs realises this propagation in O(nlog n) time. This oscillatory, global mechanism provides a powerful alternative to attention and first-order state-space models. We prove that a single Wave-PDE layer is a universal approximator. On language and vision benchmarks, Wave-PDE Nets match or exceed Transformer performance while demonstrating superior practical efficiency, reducing wall-clock time by up to 30% and peak memory by 25%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of symplectic integration and a spectral Laplacian for stability and performance. Visualizations of the learned physical parameters reveal that the model learns intuitive strategies for information propagation. These results position Wave-PDE Nets as a computationally efficient and robust architecture with a strong physical inductive bias.

arXiv:2510.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the behaviors of large language models (LLM) is fundamental to their safety alignment and reliable deployment. However, existing steering methods are primarily driven by empirical insights and lack theoretical performance guarantees. In this work, we develop a control-theoretic foundation for activation steering by showing that popular steering methods correspond to the proportional (P) controllers, with the steering vector serving as the feedback signal. Building on this finding, we propose Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Steering, a principled framework that leverages the full PID controller for activation steering in LLMs. The proportional (P) term aligns activations with target semantic directions, the integral (I) term accumulates errors to enforce persistent corrections across layers, and the derivative (D) term mitigates overshoot by counteracting rapid activation changes. This closed-loop design yields interpretable error dynamics and connects activation steering to classical stability guarantees in control theory. Moreover, PID Steering is lightweight, modular, and readily integrates with state-of-the-art steering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and benchmarks demonstrate that PID Steering consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving more robust and reliable behavioral control.

Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of crash severity is crucial in mitigating the severe consequences of traffic accidents. Accurate and timely prediction of crash severity is crucial in mitigating the severe consequences of traffic accidents. In order to provide appropriate levels of medical assistance and transportation services, an intelligent transportation system relies on effective prediction methods. Deep learning models have gained popularity in this domain due to their capability to capture non-linear relationships among variables. In this research, we have implemented a hybrid CNN-RNN deep learning model for crash severity prediction and compared its performance against widely used statistical and machine learning models such as logistic regression, na\"ive bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and individual deep learning models: RNN and CNN. This study employs a methodology that considers the interconnected relationships between various features of traffic accidents. The study was conducted using a dataset of 15,870 accident records gathered over a period of seven years between 2015 and 2021 on Virginia highway I-64. The findings demonstrate that the proposed CNN-RNN hybrid model has outperformed all benchmark models in terms of predicting crash severity. This result illustrates the effectiveness of the hybrid model as it combines the advantages of both RNN and CNN models in order to achieve greater accuracy in the prediction process.

Abstract: Training fair and unbiased machine learning models is crucial for high-stakes applications, yet it presents significant challenges. Effective bias mitigation requires deep expertise in fairness definitions, metrics, data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. In addition, the complex process of balancing model performance with fairness requirements while properly handling sensitive attributes makes fairness-aware model development inaccessible to many practitioners. To address these challenges, we introduce FairAgent, an LLM-powered automated system that significantly simplifies fairness-aware model development. FairAgent eliminates the need for deep technical expertise by automatically analyzing datasets for potential biases, handling data preprocessing and feature engineering, and implementing appropriate bias mitigation strategies based on user requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that FairAgent achieves significant performance improvements while significantly reducing development time and expertise requirements, making fairness-aware machine learning more accessible to practitioners.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P (AM-$\mu$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot \mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$\mu$P yields width-robust depth laws that transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate satisfies $\eta^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general conv+MLP blocks, we establish $\eta^\star(L)=\Theta(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$ scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without additional tuning overhead.

arXiv:2510.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

Abstract: Many high-stakes AI applications target low-prevalence events, where apparent accuracy can conceal limited real-world value. Relevant AI models range from expert-defined rules and traditional machine learning to generative LLMs constrained for classification. We outline key considerations for critical appraisal of AI in rare-event recognition, including problem framing and test set design, prevalence-aware statistical evaluation, robustness assessment, and integration into human workflows. In addition, we propose an approach to structured case-level examination (SCLE), to complement statistical performance evaluation, and a comprehensive checklist to guide procurement or development of AI models for rare-event recognition. We instantiate the framework in pharmacovigilance, drawing on three studies: rule-based retrieval of pregnancy-related reports; duplicate detection combining machine learning with probabilistic record linkage; and automated redaction of person names using an LLM. We highlight pitfalls specific to the rare-event setting including optimism from unrealistic class balance and lack of difficult positive controls in test sets - and show how cost-sensitive targets align model performance with operational value. While grounded in pharmacovigilance practice, the principles generalize to domains where positives are scarce and error costs may be asymmetric.

<title>Learning to Predict Chaos: Curriculum-Driven Training for Robust Forecasting of Chaotic Dynamics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04342</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting chaotic systems is a cornerstone challenge in many scientific fields, complicated by the exponential amplification of even infinitesimal prediction errors. Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two opposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system (e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing vast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances of any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting (CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data based on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a curriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex, chaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent and attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first training a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more chaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable representation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic ODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that pre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world benchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and human ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40% compared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training on real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across various neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations to validate the importance of the curriculum's structure.

Abstract: We propose the Causal Sphere Hypergraph Transformer (CSHT), a novel architecture for interpretable financial time-series forecasting that unifies \emph{Granger-causal hypergraph structure}, \emph{Riemannian geometry}, and \emph{causally masked Transformer attention}. CSHT models the directional influence of financial news and sentiment on asset returns by extracting multivariate Granger-causal dependencies, which are encoded as directional hyperedges on the surface of a hypersphere. Attention is constrained via angular masks that preserve both temporal directionality and geometric consistency. Evaluated on S\&amp;P 500 data from 2018 to 2023, including the 2020 COVID-19 shock, CSHT consistently outperforms baselines across return prediction, regime classification, and top-asset ranking tasks. By enforcing predictive causal structure and embedding variables in a Riemannian manifold, CSHT delivers both \emph{robust generalisation across market regimes} and \emph{transparent attribution pathways} from macroeconomic events to stock-level responses. These results suggest that CSHT is a principled and practical solution for trustworthy financial forecasting under uncertainty.

<title>Quantifying Ambiguity in Categorical Annotations: A Measure and Statistical Inference Framework</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04366</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-generated categorical annotations frequently produce empirical response distributions (soft labels) that reflect ambiguity rather than simple annotator error. We introduce an ambiguity measure that maps a discrete response distribution to a scalar in the unit interval, designed to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in categorical tasks. The measure bears a close relationship to quadratic entropy (Gini-style impurity) but departs from those indices by treating an explicit "can't solve" category asymmetrically, thereby separating uncertainty arising from class-level indistinguishability from uncertainty due to explicit unresolvability. We analyze the measure's formal properties and contrast its behavior with a representative ambiguity measure from the literature. Moving beyond description, we develop statistical tools for inference: we propose frequentist point estimators for population ambiguity and derive the Bayesian posterior over ambiguity induced by Dirichlet priors on the underlying probability vector, providing a principled account of epistemic uncertainty. Numerical examples illustrate estimation, calibration, and practical use for dataset-quality assessment and downstream machine-learning workflows.

Abstract: We introduce GDPval, a benchmark evaluating AI model capabilities on real-world economically valuable tasks. GDPval covers the majority of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Activities for 44 occupations across the top 9 sectors contributing to U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Tasks are constructed from the representative work of industry professionals with an average of 14 years of experience. We find that frontier model performance on GDPval is improving roughly linearly over time, and that the current best frontier models are approaching industry experts in deliverable quality. We analyze the potential for frontier models, when paired with human oversight, to perform GDPval tasks cheaper and faster than unaided experts. We also demonstrate that increased reasoning effort, increased task context, and increased scaffolding improves model performance on GDPval. Finally, we open-source a gold subset of 220 tasks and provide a public automated grading service at evals.openai.com to facilitate future research in understanding real-world model capabilities.

<title>Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375</link>

Abstract: The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures, while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted by the vast, generic dataset.
  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing them from being overshadowed.
  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs, complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music) with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods, particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Neural network training is typically viewed as gradient descent on a loss surface. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: learning is a structure-preserving transformation (a functor L) between the space of network parameters (Param) and the space of learned representations (Rep). This categorical framework reveals that different training runs producing similar test performance often belong to the same homotopy class (continuous deformation family) of optimization paths. We show experimentally that networks converging via homotopic trajectories generalize within 0.5% accuracy of each other, while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%. The theory provides practical tools: persistent homology identifies stable minima predictive of generalization (R^2 = 0.82 correlation), pullback constructions formalize transfer learning, and 2-categorical structures explain when different optimization algorithms yield functionally equivalent models. These categorical invariants offer both theoretical insight into why deep learning works and concrete algorithmic principles for training more robust networks.

<title>Score-based Greedy Search for Structure Identification of Partially Observed Linear Causal Models</title>

Abstract: Identifying the structure of a partially observed causal system is essential to various scientific fields. Recent advances have focused on constraint-based causal discovery to solve this problem, and yet in practice these methods often face challenges related to multiple testing and error propagation. These issues could be mitigated by a score-based method and thus it has raised great attention whether there exists a score-based greedy search method that can handle the partially observed scenario. In this work, we propose the first score-based greedy search method for the identification of structure involving latent variables with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we propose Generalized N Factor Model and establish the global consistency:
  the true structure including latent variables can be identified up to the Markov equivalence class by using score. We then design
  Latent variable Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a greedy search algorithm for this class of model with well-defined operators,
  which search very efficiently over the graph space to find the optimal structure. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data validate the effectiveness of our method (code will be publicly available).

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates dense data streams critical for diabetes management, but most used forecasting models lack interpretability for clinical use. We present SSM-CGM, a Mamba-based neural state-space forecasting model that integrates CGM and wearable activity signals from the AI-READI cohort. SSM-CGM improves short-term accuracy over a Temporal Fusion Transformer baseline, adds interpretability through variable selection and temporal attribution, and enables counterfactual forecasts simulating how planned changes in physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiration) affect near-term glucose. Together, these features make SSM-CGM an interpretable, physiologically grounded framework for personalized diabetes management.

<title>Partial Information Decomposition via Normalizing Flows in Latent Gaussian Distributions</title>

arXiv:2510.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly, or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However, existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets and selecting high-performing models.

<title>Achieve Performatively Optimal Policy for Performative Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Performative reinforcement learning is an emerging dynamical decision making framework, which extends reinforcement learning to the common applications where the agent's policy can change the environmental dynamics. Existing works on performative reinforcement learning only aim at a performatively stable (PS) policy that maximizes an approximate value function. However, there is a provably positive constant gap between the PS policy and the desired performatively optimal (PO) policy that maximizes the original value function. In contrast, this work proposes a zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm (0-FW) algorithm with a zeroth-order approximation of the performative policy gradient in the Frank-Wolfe framework, and obtains \textbf{the first polynomial-time convergence to the desired PO} policy under the standard regularizer dominance condition. For the convergence analysis, we prove two important properties of the nonconvex value function. First, when the policy regularizer dominates the environmental shift, the value function satisfies a certain gradient dominance property, so that any stationary point (not PS) of the value function is a desired PO. Second, though the value function has unbounded gradient, we prove that all the sufficiently stationary points lie in a convex and compact policy subspace $\Pi_{\Delta}$, where the policy value has a constant lower bound $\Delta>0$ and thus the gradient becomes bounded and Lipschitz continuous. Experimental results also demonstrate that our 0-FW algorithm is more effective than the existing algorithms in finding the desired PO policy.

<title>Trade-off in Estimating the Number of Byzantine Clients in Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04432</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning has attracted increasing attention at recent large-scale optimization and machine learning research and applications, but is also vulnerable to Byzantine clients that can send any erroneous signals. Robust aggregators are commonly used to resist Byzantine clients. This usually requires to estimate the unknown number $f$ of Byzantine clients, and thus accordingly select the aggregators with proper degree of robustness (i.e., the maximum number $\hat{f}$ of Byzantine clients allowed by the aggregator). Such an estimation should have important effect on the performance, which has not been systematically studied to our knowledge. This work will fill in the gap by theoretically analyzing the worst-case error of aggregators as well as its induced federated learning algorithm for any cases of $\hat{f}$ and $f$. Specifically, we will show that underestimation ($\hat{f}<f$) can lead to arbitrarily poor performance for both aggregators and federated learning. For non-underestimation ($\hat{f}\ge f$), we have proved optimal lower and upper bounds of the same order on the errors of both aggregators and federated learning. All these optimal bounds are proportional to $\hat{f}/(n-f-\hat{f})$ with $n$ clients, which monotonically increases with larger $\hat{f}$. This indicates a fundamental trade-off: while an aggregator with a larger robustness degree $\hat{f}$ can solve federated learning problems of wider range $f\in [0,\hat{f}]$, the performance can deteriorate when there are actually fewer or even no Byzantine clients (i.e., $f\in [0,\hat{f})$).

Abstract: In this work, we introduce novel algorithms for label propagation and self-training using fractional heat kernel dynamics with a source term. We motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a new test domain for which no labeled data is available. A common finding in the DG literature is that it is difficult to outperform empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the pooled training data.
  In this work, we argue that this finding has primarily been reported for datasets satisfying a \emph{covariate shift} assumption. When the dataset satisfies a \emph{posterior drift} assumption instead, we show that ``domain-informed ERM,'' wherein feature vectors are augmented with domain-specific information, outperforms pooling ERM. These claims are supported by a theoretical framework and experiments on language and vision tasks.

Abstract: While accuracy is a critical requirement for time series forecasting models, an equally important (yet often overlooked) desideratum is forecast stability across forecast creation dates (FCDs). Even highly accurate models can produce erratic revisions between FCDs, undermining stakeholder trust and disrupting downstream decision-making. To improve forecast stability, models like MQCNN, MQT, and SPADE employ a little-known but highly effective technique: forking-sequences. Unlike standard statistical and neural forecasting methods that treat each FCD independently, the forking-sequences method jointly encodes and decodes the entire time series across all FCDs, in a way mirroring time series cross-validation. Since forking sequences remains largely unknown in the broader neural forecasting community, in this work, we formalize the forking-sequences approach, and we make a case for its broader adoption. We demonstrate three key benefits of forking-sequences: (i) more stable and consistent gradient updates during training; (ii) reduced forecast variance through ensembling; and (iii) improved inference computational efficiency. We validate forking-sequences' benefits using 16 datasets from the M1, M3, M4, and Tourism competitions, showing improvements in forecast percentage change stability of 28.8%, 28.8%, 37.9%, and 31.3%, and 8.8%, on average, for MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based architectures, respectively.

arXiv:2510.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates how increasing the number of neurons in a network without increasing its number of non-zero parameters improves performance. We show that this gain corresponds with a decrease in interference between multiple features that would otherwise share the same neurons. To reduce such entanglement at a fixed non-zero parameter count, we introduce Fixed Parameter Expansion (FPE): replace a neuron with multiple children and partition the parent's weights disjointly across them, so that each child inherits a non-overlapping subset of connections. On symbolic tasks, specifically Boolean code problems, clause-aligned FPE systematically reduces polysemanticity metrics and yields higher task accuracy. Notably, random splits of neuron weights approximate these gains, indicating that reduced collisions, not precise assignment, are a primary driver. Consistent with the superposition hypothesis, the benefits of FPE grow with increasing interference: when polysemantic load is high, accuracy improvements are the largest. Transferring these insights to real models (classifiers over CLIP embeddings and deeper multilayer networks) we find that widening networks while maintaining a constant non-zero parameter count consistently increases accuracy. These results identify an interpretability-grounded mechanism to leverage width against superposition, improving performance without increasing the number of non-zero parameters. Such a direction is well matched to modern accelerators, where memory movement of non-zero parameters, rather than raw compute, is the dominant bottleneck.

<title>Wavelet Predictive Representations for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The real world is inherently non-stationary, with ever-changing factors, such as weather conditions and traffic flows, making it challenging for agents to adapt to varying environmental dynamics. Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to sequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL approaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to limited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of Wavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture signal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain predictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these multi-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task representation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients represent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary changes. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time series forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update operator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically prove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with wavelet task representations. Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that WISDOM significantly outperforms existing baselines in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, demonstrating its remarkable adaptability in complex environments characterized by non-stationary and stochastically evolving tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for regulatory workflows in cities, where the Environmental Noise Directive mandates regular strategic noise maps and action plans, often needed in permission workflows, right-of-way allocation, and construction scheduling. Physics-based solvers are too slow for such time-critical, iterative "what-if" studies. We evaluate conditional Normalizing Flows (Full-Glow) for generating for generating standards-compliant urban sound-pressure maps from 2D urban layouts in real time per 256x256 map on a single RTX 4090), enabling interactive exploration directly on commodity hardware. On datasets covering Baseline, Diffraction, and Reflection regimes, our model accelerates map generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance assessments).

Abstract: Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks. Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential. To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.

<title>Graph-based Tabular Deep Learning Should Learn Feature Interactions, Not Just Make Predictions</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress, deep learning methods for tabular data still struggle to compete with traditional tree-based models. A key challenge lies in modeling complex, dataset-specific feature interactions that are central to tabular data. Graph-based tabular deep learning (GTDL) methods aim to address this by representing features and their interactions as graphs. However, existing methods predominantly optimize predictive accuracy, neglecting accurate modeling of the graph structure. This position paper argues that GTDL should move beyond prediction-centric objectives and prioritize the explicit learning and evaluation of feature interactions. Using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth graph structures, we show that existing GTDL methods fail to recover meaningful feature interactions. Moreover, enforcing the true interaction structure improves predictive performance. This highlights the need for GTDL methods to prioritize quantitative evaluation and accurate structural learning. We call for a shift toward structure-aware modeling as a foundation for building GTDL systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, trustworthy, and grounded in domain understanding.

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e., outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision encoders.

<title>Tail-Safe Hedging: Explainable Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with a White-Box CBF--QP Safety Layer in Arbitrage-Free Markets</title>

arXiv:2510.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Tail-Safe, a deployability-oriented framework for derivatives hedging that unifies distributional, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with a white-box control-barrier-function (CBF) quadratic-program (QP) safety layer tailored to financial constraints. The learning component combines an IQN-based distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets, tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free, microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate methodological contributions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the identification of the top-m user-scheduling sets in multi-user MIMO downlink, which is cast as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem in stochastic linear bandits. Because the action space grows exponentially, exhaustive search is infeasible. We therefore adopt a linear utility model to enable efficient exploration and reliable selection of promising user subsets. We introduce a gap-index framework that maintains a shortlist of current estimates of champion arms (top-m sets) and a rotating shortlist of challenger arms that pose the greatest threat to the champions. This design focuses on measurements that yield the most informative gap-index-based comparisons, resulting in significant reductions in runtime and computation compared to state-of-the-art linear bandit methods, with high identification accuracy. The method also exposes a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Simulations on a realistic OFDM downlink show that shortlist-driven pure exploration makes online, measurement-efficient subcarrier selection practical for AI-enabled communication systems.

Abstract: Distortion Risk Measures (DRMs) capture risk preferences in decision-making and serve as general criteria for managing uncertainty. This paper proposes gradient descent algorithms for DRM optimization based on two dual representations: the Distortion-Measure (DM) form and Quantile-Function (QF) form. The DM-form employs a three-timescale algorithm to track quantiles, compute their gradients, and update decision variables, utilizing the Generalized Likelihood Ratio and kernel-based density estimation. The QF-form provides a simpler two-timescale approach that avoids the need for complex quantile gradient estimation. A hybrid form integrates both approaches, applying the DM-form for robust performance around distortion function jumps and the QF-form for efficiency in smooth regions. Proofs of strong convergence and convergence rates for the proposed algorithms are provided. In particular, the DM-form achieves an optimal rate of $O(k^{-4/7})$, while the QF-form attains a faster rate of $O(k^{-2/3})$. Numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines in robust portfolio selection tasks. The method's scalability is further illustrated through integration into deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a DRM-based Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm is developed and applied to multi-echelon dynamic inventory management, showcasing its practical applicability.

<title>GILT: An LLM-Free, Tuning-Free Graph Foundational Model for In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage, creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning \textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features. Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the versatility and robustness of our approach.

<title>Busemann Functions in the Wasserstein Space: Existence, Closed-Forms, and Applications to Slicing</title>

arXiv:2510.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of geometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto geodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of hyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as probability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the Wasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by Optimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and computation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic rays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases: one-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable explicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, which in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over Gaussian mixtures and labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of those original schemes on synthetic datasets as well as transfer learning problems.

Abstract: Probabilistic regression models the entire predictive distribution of a response variable, offering richer insights than classical point estimates and directly allowing for uncertainty quantification. While diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable success in generating complex, high-dimensional data, their usage in general regression tasks often lacks uncertainty-related evaluation and remains limited to domain-specific applications. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for probabilistic regression that learns predictive distributions in a nonparametric way. More specifically, we propose to model the full distribution of the diffusion noise, enabling adaptation to diverse tasks and enhanced uncertainty quantification. We investigate different noise parameterizations, analyze their trade-offs, and evaluate our framework across a broad range of regression tasks, covering low- and high-dimensional settings. For several experiments, our approach shows superior performance against existing baselines, while delivering calibrated uncertainty estimates, demonstrating its versatility as a tool for probabilistic prediction.

Abstract: Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating between gradient descent steps on the backbone and closed-form updates on the last layer. We adapt the method for the setting of stochastic gradient descent, by trading off the loss on the current batch against the accumulated information from previous batches. Further, we prove that, in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, convergence of this method to an optimal solution is guaranteed. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with standard SGD on a squared loss in several supervised tasks -- both regression and classification -- including Fourier Neural Operators and Instrumental Variable Regression.

<title>Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured, incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory), consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost. Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model. These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable, efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. We propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based on advanced forecasting models that accurately replicates complex electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These synthetic datasets preserve essential temporal and spectral properties of real data, which enables robust analysis while effectively addressing data scarcity and privacy challenges. Our evaluations across multiple subjects demonstrate that the generated synthetic data can serve as an effective substitute for real data and also significantly boost AI model performance. The approach maintains critical biomedical features while provides high scalability for various applications and integrates seamlessly into open-source repositories, substantially expanding resources for AI-driven biomedical research.

Abstract: Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of four small embedding models.

Abstract: Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations yield as much as a 7x speedup.

<title>IMLP: An Energy-Efficient Continual Learning Method for Tabular Data Streams</title>

Abstract: Tabular data streams are rapidly emerging as a dominant modality for real-time decision-making in healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These applications commonly run on edge and mobile devices, where energy budgets, memory, and compute are strictly limited. Continual learning (CL) addresses such dynamics by training models sequentially on task streams while preserving prior knowledge and consolidating new knowledge. While recent CL work has advanced in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving knowledge transfer, the practical requirements of energy and memory efficiency for tabular data streams remain underexplored. In particular, existing CL solutions mostly depend on replay mechanisms whose buffers grow over time and exacerbate resource costs.
  We propose a context-aware incremental Multi-Layer Perceptron (IMLP), a compact continual learner for tabular data streams. IMLP incorporates a windowed scaled dot-product attention over a sliding latent feature buffer, enabling constant-size memory and avoiding storing raw data. The attended context is concatenated with current features and processed by shared feed-forward layers, yielding lightweight per-segment updates. To assess practical deployability, we introduce NetScore-T, a tunable metric coupling balanced accuracy with energy for Pareto-aware comparison across models and datasets. IMLP achieves up to $27.6\times$ higher energy efficiency than TabNet and $85.5\times$ higher than TabPFN, while maintaining competitive average accuracy. Overall, IMLP provides an easy-to-deploy, energy-efficient alternative to full retraining for tabular data streams.

<title>Noise or Signal? Deconstructing Contradictions and An Adaptive Remedy for Reversible Normalization in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) is a key technique enabling simple linear models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts (termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal a far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance of various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical contradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the standard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where its MSE surges by a staggering 683\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN prevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer, our adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic, unexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome uncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the instability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more damaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of this work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a shift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that reveals not only the surprising power of simple baselines but also the perilous nature of naive adaptation.

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise", degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness; and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a prominent methodology for optimizing expensive black-box functions by leveraging Gaussian process surrogates, which focus on capturing the global characteristics of the objective function. However, in numerous practical scenarios, the primary objective is not to construct an exhaustive global surrogate, but rather to quickly pinpoint the global optimum. Due to the aleatoric nature of the sequential optimization problem and its dependence on the quality of the surrogate model and the initial design, it is restrictive to assume that all observed samples contribute equally to the discovery of the optimum in this context. In this paper, we introduce Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization (CCGBO), a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the contribution of individual historical observations through counterfactual credit. By incorporating counterfactual credit into the acquisition function, our approach can selectively allocate resources in areas where optimal solutions are most likely to occur. We prove that CCGBO retains sublinear regret. Empirical evaluations on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that CCGBO consistently reduces simple regret and accelerates convergence to the global optimum.

<title>Parameter-free Algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial Model</title>

arXiv:2510.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the first parameter-free algorithms for the Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, a framework that bridges adversarial and stochastic online convex optimization. Existing approaches for the SEA model require prior knowledge of problem-specific parameters, such as the diameter of the domain $D$ and the Lipschitz constant of the loss functions $G$, which limits their practical applicability. Addressing this, we develop parameter-free methods by leveraging the Optimistic Online Newton Step (OONS) algorithm to eliminate the need for these parameters. We first establish a comparator-adaptive algorithm for the scenario with unknown domain diameter but known Lipschitz constant, achieving an expected regret bound of $\tilde{O}\big(\|u\|_2^2 + \|u\|_2(\sqrt{\sigma^2_{1:T}} + \sqrt{\Sigma^2_{1:T}})\big)$, where $u$ is the comparator vector and $\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$ represent the cumulative stochastic variance and cumulative adversarial variation, respectively. We then extend this to the more general setting where both $D$ and $G$ are unknown, attaining the comparator- and Lipschitz-adaptive algorithm. Notably, the regret bound exhibits the same dependence on $\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed methods even when both parameters are unknown in the SEA model.

Abstract: Model merging methods combine models with different capabilities into a single one while maintaining the same inference cost. Two popular approaches are linear interpolation, which linearly interpolates between model weights, and task arithmetic, which combines task vectors obtained by the difference between finetuned and base models. While useful in practice, what properties make merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the optimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on merging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale -- unifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across architectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a non-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing this quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay, smaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the effective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work that connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual minima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when independently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the understanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its downstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of further manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.

Abstract: Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent higher-order interactions among multiple entities. While undirected hypergraphs have been extensively studied, the case of directed hypergraphs, which can model oriented group interactions, remains largely under-explored despite its relevance for many applications. Recent approaches in this direction often exhibit an implicit bias toward homophily, which limits their effectiveness in heterophilic settings. Rooted in the algebraic topology notion of Cellular Sheaves, Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) were introduced as an effective solution to circumvent such a drawback. While a generalization to hypergraphs is known, it is only suitable for undirected hypergraphs, failing to tackle the directed case. In this work, we introduce Directional Sheaf Hypergraph Networks (DSHN), a framework integrating sheaf theory with a principled treatment of asymmetric relations within a hypergraph. From it, we construct the Directed Sheaf Hypergraph Laplacian, a complex-valued operator by which we unify and generalize many existing Laplacian matrices proposed in the graph- and hypergraph-learning literature. Across 7 real-world datasets and against 13 baselines, DSHN achieves relative accuracy gains from 2% up to 20%, showing how a principled treatment of directionality in hypergraphs, combined with the expressive power of sheaves, can substantially improve performance.

<title>EVaR-Optimal Arm Identification in Bandits</title>

Abstract: We study the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem within the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework under the Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) criterion. Our analysis considers a nonparametric setting, allowing for general reward distributions bounded in [0,1]. This formulation addresses the critical need for risk-averse decision-making in high-stakes environments, such as finance, moving beyond simple expected value optimization. We propose a $\delta$-correct, Track-and-Stop based algorithm and derive a corresponding lower bound on the expected sample complexity, which we prove is asymptotically matched. The implementation of our algorithm and the characterization of the lower bound both require solving a complex convex optimization problem and a related, simpler non-convex one.

<title>Provable Affine Identifiability of Nonlinear CCA under Latent Distributional Priors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04758</link>

arXiv:2510.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish conditions under which nonlinear CCA recovers the ground-truth latent factors up to an orthogonal transform after whitening. Building on the classical result that linear mappings maximize canonical correlations under Gaussian priors, we prove affine identifiability for a broad class of latent distributions in the population setting. Central to our proof is a reparameterization result that transports the analysis from observation space to source space, where identifiability becomes tractable. We further show that whitening is essential for ensuring boundedness and well-conditioning, thereby underpinning identifiability. Beyond the population setting, we prove that ridge-regularized empirical CCA converges to its population counterpart, transferring these guarantees to the finite-sample regime. Experiments on a controlled synthetic dataset and a rendered image dataset validate our theory and demonstrate the necessity of its assumptions through systematic ablations.

<title>ParallelBench: Understanding the Trade-offs of Parallel Decoding in Diffusion LLMs</title>

Abstract: While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.

<title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.

<title>Distribution Preference Optimization: A Fine-grained Perspective for LLM Unlearning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04773</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed \textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.

Abstract: Structural biology has made significant progress in determining membrane proteins, leading to a remarkable increase in the number of available structures in dedicated databases. The inherent complexity of membrane protein structures, coupled with challenges such as missing data, inconsistencies, and computational barriers from disparate sources, underscores the need for improved database integration. To address this gap, we present MetaMP, a framework that unifies membrane-protein databases within a web application and uses machine learning for classification. MetaMP improves data quality by enriching metadata, offering a user-friendly interface, and providing eight interactive views for streamlined exploration. MetaMP was effective across tasks of varying difficulty, demonstrating advantages across different levels without compromising speed or accuracy, according to user evaluations. Moreover, MetaMP supports essential functions such as structure classification and outlier detection.
  We present three practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in membrane protein research: predicting transmembrane segments, reconciling legacy databases, and classifying structures with explainable AI support. In a validation focused on statistics, MetaMP resolved 77% of data discrepancies and accurately predicted the class of newly identified membrane proteins 98% of the time and overtook expert curation. Altogether, MetaMP is a much-needed resource that harmonizes current knowledge and empowers AI-driven exploration of membrane-protein architecture.

<title>Learning on the Job: Test-Time Curricula for Targeted Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2510.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are good at learning on the job: We learn how to solve the tasks we face as we go along. Can a model do the same? We propose an agent that assembles a task-specific curriculum, called test-time curriculum (TTC-RL), and applies reinforcement learning to continue training the model for its target task. The test-time curriculum avoids time-consuming human curation of datasets by automatically selecting the most task-relevant data from a large pool of available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that reinforcement learning on a test-time curriculum consistently improves the model on its target tasks, across a variety of evaluations and models. Notably, on challenging math and coding benchmarks, TTC-RL improves the pass@1 of Qwen3-8B by approximately 1.8x on AIME25 and 2.1x on CodeElo. Moreover, we find that TTC-RL significantly raises the performance ceiling compared to the initial model, increasing pass@8 on AIME25 from 40% to 62% and on CodeElo from 28% to 43%. Our findings show the potential of test-time curricula in extending the test-time scaling paradigm to continual training on thousands of task-relevant experiences during test-time.

<title>On Predicting Post-Click Conversion Rate via Counterfactual Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04816</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04816</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks. However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs. We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples. Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the theoretical significance and wide practical use of regular expressions, the computational complexity of learning them has been largely unexplored. We study the computational hardness of improperly learning regular expressions in the PAC model and with membership queries. We show that PAC learning is hard even under the uniform distribution on the hypercube, and also prove hardness of distribution-free learning with membership queries. Furthermore, if regular expressions are extended with complement or intersection, we establish hardness of learning with membership queries even under the uniform distribution. We emphasize that these results do not follow from existing hardness results for learning DFAs or NFAs, since the descriptive complexity of regular languages can differ exponentially between DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions.

Abstract: Bond Centered FingerPrint (BCFP) are a complementary, bond-centric alternative to Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). We introduce a static BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose BCFP-Sort&amp;Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.

Abstract: Causal Abstraction (CA) theory provides a principled framework for relating causal models that describe the same system at different levels of granularity while ensuring interventional consistency between them. Recently, several approaches for learning CAs have been proposed, but all assume fixed and well-specified exogenous distributions, making them vulnerable to environmental shifts and misspecification. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments, leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention mapping misspecification.

<title>Synthesising Counterfactual Explanations via Label-Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) provide recourse recommendations for individuals affected by algorithmic decisions. A key challenge is generating CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties. These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs. Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes, as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids. Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options, allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition, user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.

<title>Alignment Tipping Process: How Self-Evolution Pushes LLM Agents Off the Rails</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04860</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies. We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms: Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.

Abstract: Intraoperative pathology is pivotal to precision surgery, yet its clinical impact is constrained by diagnostic complexity and the limited availability of high-quality frozen-section data. While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.

Abstract: Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps while preserving diversity.

<title>Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of "ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare.

<title>Benchmarking M-LTSF: Frequency and Noise-Based Evaluation of Multivariate Long Time Series Forecasting Models</title>

Abstract: Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear (linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals. White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed, offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.

Abstract: Skills are essential for unlocking higher levels of problem solving. A common approach to discovering these skills is to learn ones that reliably reach different states, thus empowering the agent to control its environment. However, existing skill discovery algorithms often overlook the natural state variables present in many reinforcement learning problems, meaning that the discovered skills lack control of specific state variables. This can significantly hamper exploration efficiency, make skills more challenging to learn with, and lead to negative side effects in downstream tasks when the goal is under-specified. We introduce a general method that enables these skill discovery algorithms to learn focused skills -- skills that target and control specific state variables. Our approach improves state space coverage by a factor of three, unlocks new learning capabilities, and automatically avoids negative side effects in downstream tasks.

Abstract: The tuning of hyperparameters in distributed machine learning can substantially impact model performance. When the hyperparameters are tuned on sensitive data, privacy becomes an important challenge and to this end, differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for provable privacy. A standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients agree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters, like the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on differentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally expensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for each client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to undesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.
  In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed and privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting based on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE selects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of clients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning tasks. We prove that DP-HYPE preserves the strong notion of differential privacy called client-level differential privacy and, importantly, show that its privacy guarantees do not depend on the number of hyperparameters. We also provide bounds on its utility guarantees, that is, the probability of reaching a compromise, and implement DP-HYPE as a submodule in the popular Flower framework for distributed machine learning. In addition, we evaluate performance on multiple benchmark data sets in iid as well as multiple non-iid settings and demonstrate high utility of DP-HYPE even under small privacy budgets.

<title>How Different from the Past? Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04908</link>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/ST-SSDL.

<title>Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation</title>

Abstract: Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates, these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck (Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations under missingness. Our code implementation is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.

Abstract: Training automatic modulation classification (AMC) models on centrally aggregated data raises privacy concerns, incurs communication overhead, and often fails to confer robustness to channel shifts. Federated learning (FL) avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients, followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.

<title>Egalitarian Gradient Descent: A Simple Approach to Accelerated Grokking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04930</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking is the phenomenon whereby, unlike the training performance, which peaks early in the training process, the test/generalization performance of a model stagnates over arbitrarily many epochs and then suddenly jumps to usually close to perfect levels. In practice, it is desirable to reduce the length of such plateaus, that is to make the learning process "grok" faster. In this work, we provide new insights into grokking. First, we show both empirically and theoretically that grokking can be induced by asymmetric speeds of (stochastic) gradient descent, along different principal (i.e singular directions) of the gradients. We then propose a simple modification that normalizes the gradients so that dynamics along all the principal directions evolves at exactly the same speed. Then, we establish that this modified method, which we call egalitarian gradient descent (EGD) and can be seen as a carefully modified form of natural gradient descent, groks much faster. In fact, in some cases the stagnation is completely removed. Finally, we empirically show that on classical arithmetic problems such as modular addition and sparse parity problem which this stagnation has been widely observed and intensively studied, that our proposed method eliminates the plateaus.

arXiv:2510.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design process of high-performing architectures, but remains bottlenecked by expensive performance evaluation. Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural network architecture instantly.

<title>On Structured State-Space Duality</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient sequence models.

<title>Feasibility-Aware Decision-Focused Learning for Predicting Parameters in the Constraints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When some parameters of a constrained optimization problem (COP) are uncertain, this gives rise to a predict-then-optimize (PtO) problem, comprising two stages -- the prediction of the unknown parameters from contextual information and the subsequent optimization using those predicted parameters. Decision-focused learning (DFL) implements the first stage by training a machine learning (ML) model to optimize the quality of the decisions made using the predicted parameters. When parameters in the constraints of a COP are predicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions. Therefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and decision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint parameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the underlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear program (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption. We derive two novel loss functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): the first one penalizes infeasibility (by penalizing when the predicted parameters lead to infeasible solutions), and the second one penalizes suboptimal decisions (by penalizing when the true optimal solution is infeasible under the predicted parameters). We introduce a single tunable parameter to form a weighted average of the two losses, allowing decision-makers to balance suboptimality and feasibility. We experimentally demonstrate that adjusting this parameter provides a decision-maker the control over the trade-off between the two. Moreover, across several COP instances, we find that for a single value of the tunable parameter, our method matches the performance of the existing baselines on suboptimality and feasibility.

Abstract: We present StructuralDecompose, an R package for modular and interpretable time series decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that treat decomposition as a monolithic process, StructuralDecompose separates the analysis into distinct components: changepoint detection, anomaly detection, smoothing, and decomposition. This design provides flexibility and robust- ness, allowing users to tailor methods to specific time series characteristics. We demonstrate the package on simulated and real-world datasets, benchmark its performance against state-of-the- art tools such as Rbeast and autostsm, and discuss its role in interpretable machine learning workflows.

arXiv:2510.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are fundamental tools for evaluating machine learning classifiers, offering detailed insights into the trade-offs between true positive rate vs. false positive rate (ROC) or precision vs. recall (PR). However, in Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple clients, computing these curves is challenging due to privacy and communication constraints. Specifically, the server cannot access raw prediction scores and class labels, which are used to compute the ROC and PR curves in a centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel method for approximating ROC and PR curves in a federated setting by estimating quantiles of the prediction score distribution under distributed differential privacy. We provide theoretical bounds on the Area Error (AE) between the true and estimated curves, demonstrating the trade-offs between approximation accuracy, privacy, and communication cost. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high approximation accuracy with minimal communication and strong privacy guarantees, making it practical for privacy-preserving model evaluation in federated systems.

Abstract: The vast majority of modern deep learning models are trained with momentum-based first-order optimizers. The momentum term governs the optimizer's memory by determining how much each past gradient contributes to the current convergence direction. Fundamental momentum methods, such as Nesterov Accelerated Gradient and the Heavy Ball method, as well as more recent optimizers such as AdamW and Lion, all rely on the momentum coefficient that is customarily set to $\beta = 0.9$ and kept constant during model training, a strategy widely used by practitioners, yet suboptimal. In this paper, we introduce an \textit{adaptive memory} mechanism that replaces constant momentum with a dynamic momentum coefficient that is adjusted online during optimization. We derive our method by approximating the objective function using two planes: one derived from the gradient at the current iterate and the other obtained from the accumulated memory of the past gradients. To the best of our knowledge, such a proximal framework was never used for momentum-based optimization. Our proposed approach is novel, extremely simple to use, and does not rely on extra assumptions or hyperparameter tuning. We implement adaptive memory variants of both SGD and AdamW across a wide range of learning tasks, from simple convex problems to large-scale deep learning scenarios, demonstrating that our approach can outperform standard SGD and Adam with hand-tuned momentum coefficients. Finally, our work opens doors for new ways of inducing adaptivity in optimization.

Abstract: Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

<title>Rethinking Langevin Thompson Sampling from A Stochastic Approximation Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However, they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in different round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific tuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this non-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic approximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a posterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy proposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary posterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed step-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior estimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds for TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by interpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process. Our empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with certain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.

arXiv:2510.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are sometimes trained with imperfect oversight signals, leading to undesired behaviors such as reward hacking and sycophancy. Improving oversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that improve learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce Inoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that prevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to explicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we modify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only works on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we find that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially reducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which more strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more effectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this serves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is a simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning, preventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting desired capabilities.

Abstract: We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice, collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to 3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%. Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a critical role in determining performance during inference.

Abstract: Machine learning in healthcare requires effective representation of structured medical codes, but current methods face a trade off: knowledge graph based approaches capture formal relationships but miss real world patterns, while data driven methods learn empirical associations but often overlook structured knowledge in medical terminologies. We present KEEP (Knowledge preserving and Empirically refined Embedding Process), an efficient framework that bridges this gap by combining knowledge graph embeddings with adaptive learning from clinical data. KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Importantly, KEEP produces final embeddings without task specific auxiliary or end to end training enabling KEEP to support multiple downstream applications and model architectures. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank and MIMIC IV demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and Language Model based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical outcomes. Moreover, KEEP's minimal computational requirements make it particularly suitable for resource constrained environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring robustness in high-stakes machine learning applications. We introduce HybridFlow, a modular hybrid architecture that unifies the modeling of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by combining a Conditional Masked Autoregressive normalizing flow for estimating aleatoric uncertainty with a flexible probabilistic predictor for epistemic uncertainty. The framework supports integration with any probabilistic model class, allowing users to easily adapt HybridFlow to existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.

Abstract: As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

<title>ResCP: Reservoir Conformal Prediction for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed under diverse memory and compute constraints. Existing approaches build model families by training each size independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only coarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that we call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher), one first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs intermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the student without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot interpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales smoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing pretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this type of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and student through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation thus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model families, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible adaptation across deployment environments. The code and models are available at https://github.com/dcml-lab/boomerang-distillation.

Abstract: This study presents a novel small-area estimation framework to enhance urban transportation planning through detailed characterization of travel behavior. Our approach improves on the four-step travel model by employing publicly available microdata files and machine learning methods to predict travel behavior for a representative, synthetic population at small geographic areas. This approach enables high-resolution estimation of trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and route assignment. Validation using ACS/PUMS work-commute datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves higher accuracy compared to conventional approaches. The resulting granular insights enable the tailoring of interventions to address localized situations and support a range of policy applications and targeted interventions, including the optimal placement of micro-fulfillment centers, effective curb-space management, and the design of more inclusive transportation solutions particularly for vulnerable communities.

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

<title>From Noisy Traces to Stable Gradients: Bias-Variance Optimized Preference Optimization for Aligning Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical tasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple, drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions, tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks. These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more stable training and stronger overall performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.

Abstract: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

<title>Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial market volatility is critical for risk management, derivatives pricing, and investment strategy. In this study, we propose a multitude of regime-switching methods to improve the prediction of S&amp;P 500 volatility by capturing structural changes in the market across time. We use eleven years of SPX data, from May 1st, 2014 to May 27th, 2025, to compute daily realized volatility (RV) from 5-minute intraday log returns, adjusted for irregular trading days. To enhance forecast accuracy, we engineered features to capture both historical dynamics and forward-looking market sentiment across regimes. The regime-switching methods include a soft Markov switching algorithm to estimate soft-regime probabilities, a distributional spectral clustering method that uses XGBoost to assign clusters at prediction time, and a coefficient-based soft regime algorithm that extracts HAR coefficients from time segments segmented through the Mood test and clusters through Bayesian GMM for soft regime weights, using XGBoost to predict regime probabilities. Models were evaluated across three time periods--before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The coefficient-based clustering algorithm outperformed all other models, including the baseline autoregressive model, during all time periods. Additionally, each model was evaluated on its recursive forecasting performance for 5- and 10-day horizons during each time period. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of regime-aware modeling frameworks and soft clustering approaches in improving volatility forecasting, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty and structural change.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions, particularly in hyperparameter tuning. However, standard BO assumes access to precise objective values, which may be unavailable, noisy, or unreliable in real-world settings where only relative or rank-based feedback can be obtained. In this study, we propose Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization (QS-BO), a principled rank-based optimization framework. QS-BO converts ranks into heteroscedastic Gaussian targets through a quantile-scaling pipeline, enabling the use of Gaussian process surrogates and standard acquisition functions without requiring explicit metric scores. We evaluate QS-BO on synthetic benchmark functions, including one- and two-dimensional nonlinear functions and the Branin function, and compare its performance against Random Search. Results demonstrate that QS-BO consistently achieves lower objective values and exhibits greater stability across runs. Statistical tests further confirm that QS-BO significantly outperforms Random Search at the 1\% significance level. These findings establish QS-BO as a practical and effective extension of Bayesian Optimization for rank-only feedback, with promising applications in preference learning, recommendation, and human-in-the-loop optimization where absolute metric values are unavailable or unreliable.

Abstract: Machine Learning is becoming increasingly more important in today's world. It is therefore very important to provide understanding of the decision-making process of machine-learning models. A popular way to do this is by looking at the Shapley-Values of these models as introduced by Lundberg and Lee.
  In this thesis, we discuss the two main results by Lundberg and Lee from a mathematically rigorous standpoint and provide full proofs, which are not available from the original material.
  The first result of this thesis is an axiomatic characterization of the Shapley values in machine learning based on axioms by Young. We show that the Shapley values are the unique explanation to satisfy local accuracy, missingness, symmetry and consistency. Lundberg and Lee claim that the symmetry axiom is redundant for explanations. However, we provide a counterexample that shows the symmetry axiom is in fact essential.
  The second result shows that we can write the Shapley values as the unique solution to a weighted linear regression problem. This result is proven with the use of dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping. Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically. However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side, server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates, highlighting the limited robustness of state-of-the-art agents.

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset, covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network (EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test). With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics (model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93% test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.

Abstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.

Abstract: We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose attention patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on content. We argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when the underlying token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators from a "calibration text", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such stable heads in the first layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined output by a linear summary of the surrounding text. This approximation enables a procedure where from the weights alone - and a single calibration text - we can uncover hundreds of first layer neurons that respond to high-level contextual properties of the surrounding text, including neurons that didn't activate on the calibration text.

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However, most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing science.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but is vulnerable to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), where adversaries reconstruct private data from shared gradients. Existing defenses either incur impractical computational overhead for embedded platforms or fail to achieve privacy protection and good model utility at the same time. Moreover, many defenses can be easily bypassed by adaptive adversaries who have obtained the defense details. To address these limitations, we propose SVDefense, a novel defense framework against GIAs that leverages the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to obfuscate gradient updates. SVDefense introduces three key innovations, a Self-Adaptive Energy Threshold that adapts to client vulnerability, a Channel-Wise Weighted Approximation that selectively preserves essential gradient information for effective model training while enhancing privacy protection, and a Layer-Wise Weighted Aggregation for effective model aggregation under class imbalance. Our extensive evaluation shows that SVDefense outperforms existing defenses across multiple applications, including image classification, human activity recognition, and keyword spotting, by offering robust privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy. Furthermore, SVDefense is practical for deployment on various resource-constrained embedded platforms. We will make our code publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (NNs) for computer vision are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., miniscule malicious changes to inputs may induce unintuitive outputs. One key approach to verify and mitigate such robustness issues is to falsify expected output behavior. This allows, e.g., to locally proof security, or to (re)train NNs on obtained adversarial input examples. Due to the black-box nature of NNs, current attacks only falsify a class of the final output, such as flipping from $\texttt{stop_sign}$ to $\neg\texttt{stop_sign}$. In this short position paper we generalize this to search for generally illogical behavior, as considered in NN verification: falsify constraints (concept-based properties) involving further human-interpretable concepts, like $\texttt{red}\wedge\texttt{octogonal}\rightarrow\texttt{stop_sign}$. For this, an easy implementation of concept-based properties on already trained NNs is proposed using techniques from explainable artificial intelligence. Further, we sketch the theoretical proof that attacks on concept-based properties are expected to have a reduced search space compared to simple class falsification, whilst arguably be more aligned with intuitive robustness targets. As an outlook to this work in progress we hypothesize that this approach has potential to efficiently and simultaneously improve logical compliance and robustness.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection systems.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is critical for timely intervention, yet current diagnostic approaches remain resource-intensive and invasive. Speech, encompassing both acoustic and linguistic dimensions, offers a promising non-invasive biomarker for cognitive decline. In this study, we present a machine learning framework for the PROCESS Challenge, leveraging both audio embeddings and linguistic features derived from spontaneous speech recordings. Audio representations were extracted using Whisper embeddings from the Cookie Theft description task, while linguistic features-spanning pronoun usage, syntactic complexity, filler words, and clause structure-were obtained from transcriptions across Semantic Fluency, Phonemic Fluency, and Cookie Theft picture description. Classification models aimed to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC), MCI, and AD participants, while regression models predicted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Results demonstrated that voted ensemble models trained on concatenated linguistic features achieved the best classification performance (F1 = 0.497), while Whisper embedding-based ensemble regressors yielded the lowest MMSE prediction error (RMSE = 2.843). Comparative evaluation within the PROCESS Challenge placed our models among the top submissions in regression task, and mid-range for classification, highlighting the complementary strengths of linguistic and audio embeddings. These findings reinforce the potential of multimodal speech-based approaches for scalable, non-invasive cognitive assessment and underline the importance of integrating task-specific linguistic and acoustic markers in dementia detection.

<title>Assessing the impact of contact time on leachate chemistry from recycled concrete aggregates</title>

Abstract: Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available, mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period. Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH > 10) and decreases over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/mhdfb/sideinfo-search-reconstruction}{this repository}.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation, embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points, enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness, hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Abstract: The Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) method is a recently proposed class of parameter estimation algorithms that exhibits notable noise robustness and computational efficiency. This work examines the coverage and bias properties of the original WENDy-IRLS algorithm's parameter and state estimators in the context of the following differential equations: Logistic, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark. The estimators' performance was studied in simulated data examples, under four different noise distributions (normal, log-normal, additive censored normal, and additive truncated normal), and a wide range of noise, reaching levels much higher than previously tested for this algorithm.

Abstract: DB engines produce efficient query execution plans by relying on cost models. Practical implementations estimate cardinality of queries using heuristics, with magic numbers tuned to improve average performance on benchmarks. Empirically, estimation error significantly grows with query complexity. Alternatively, learning-based estimators offer improved accuracy, but add operational complexity preventing their adoption in-practice. Recognizing that query workloads contain highly repetitive subquery patterns, we learn many simple regressors online, each localized to a pattern. The regressor corresponding to a pattern can be randomly-accessed using hash of graph structure of the subquery. Our method has negligible overhead and competes with SoTA learning-based approaches on error metrics. Further, amending PostgreSQL with our method achieves notable accuracy and runtime improvements over traditional methods and drastically reduces operational costs compared to other learned cardinality estimators, thereby offering the most practical and efficient solution on the Pareto frontier. Concretely, simulating JOB-lite workload on IMDb speeds-up execution by 7.5 minutes (>30%) while incurring only 37 seconds overhead for online learning.

Abstract: Current quantum computers require algorithms that use limited resources economically. In quantum machine learning, success hinges on quantum feature maps, which embed classical data into the state space of qubits. We introduce Quantum Feature-Map Learning via Analytic Iterative Reconstructions (Q-FLAIR), an algorithm that reduces quantum resource overhead in iterative feature-map circuit construction. It shifts workloads to a classical computer via partial analytic reconstructions of the quantum model, using only a few evaluations. For each probed gate addition to the ansatz, the simultaneous selection and optimization of the data feature and weight parameter is then entirely classical. Integrated into quantum neural network and quantum kernel support vector classifiers, Q-FLAIR shows state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Since resource overhead decouples from feature dimension, we train a quantum model on a real IBM device in only four hours, surpassing 90% accuracy on the full-resolution MNIST dataset (784 features, digits 3 vs 5). Such results were previously unattainable, as the feature dimension prohibitively drives hardware demands for fixed and search costs for adaptive ans\"atze. By rethinking feature-map learning beyond black-box optimization, this work takes a concrete step toward enabling quantum machine learning for real-world problems and near-term quantum computers.

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems, relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally, models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others' existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition. We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop appropriate AI self-awareness.

Abstract: We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively. Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and cyber threats.

Abstract: Communication efficiency is a central challenge in distributed machine learning training, and message compression is a widely used solution. However, standard Error Feedback (EF) methods (Seide et al., 2014), though effective for smooth unconstrained optimization with compression (Karimireddy et al., 2019), fail in the broader and practically important setting of composite optimization, which captures, e.g., objectives consisting of a smooth loss combined with a non-smooth regularizer or constraints. The theoretical foundation and behavior of EF in the context of the general composite setting remain largely unexplored. In this work, we consider composite optimization with EF. We point out that the basic EF mechanism and its analysis no longer stand when a composite part is involved. We argue that this is because of a fundamental limitation in the method and its analysis technique. We propose a novel method that combines Dual Averaging with EControl (Gao et al., 2024), a state-of-the-art variant of the EF mechanism, and achieves for the first time a strong convergence analysis for composite optimization with error feedback. Along with our new algorithm, we also provide a new and novel analysis template for inexact dual averaging method, which might be of independent interest. We also provide experimental results to complement our theoretical findings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution, which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no additional cost.

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic computational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$. Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated, fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation from quadratic ($O(N^2 \cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \cdot T)$) with respect to the number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline stateless model of comparable size.

Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches 65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains 77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model may allow it to improve greatly.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts (CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research directions.

<title>Can an LLM Induce a Graph? Investigating Memory Drift and Context Length</title>

Abstract: Recently proposed evaluation benchmarks aim to characterize the effective context length and the forgetting tendencies of large language models (LLMs). However, these benchmarks often rely on simplistic 'needle in a haystack' retrieval or continuation tasks that may not accurately reflect the performance of these models in information-dense scenarios. Thus, rather than simple next token prediction, we argue for evaluating these models on more complex reasoning tasks that requires them to induce structured relational knowledge from the text - such as graphs from potentially noisy natural language content. While the input text can be viewed as generated in terms of a graph, its structure is not made explicit and connections must be induced from distributed textual cues, separated by long contexts and interspersed with irrelevant information. Our findings reveal that LLMs begin to exhibit memory drift and contextual forgetting at much shorter effective lengths when tasked with this form of relational reasoning, compared to what existing benchmarks suggest. With these findings, we offer recommendations for the optimal use of popular LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We further show that even models specialized for reasoning, such as OpenAI o1, remain vulnerable to early memory drift in these settings. These results point to significant limitations in the models' ability to abstract structured knowledge from unstructured input and highlight the need for architectural adaptations to improve long-range reasoning.

Abstract: The introduction of machine learning methods has led to significant advances in automation, optimization, and discoveries in various fields of science and technology. However, their widespread application faces a fundamental limitation: the transfer of models between data domains generally lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. The key problem is the lack of formal criteria to guarantee that a model trained on one type of data will retain its properties on another.This paper proposes a solution to this problem by formalizing the concept of analogy between data sets and models using first-order logic and Hoare logic.We formulate and rigorously prove a theorem that sets out the necessary and sufficient conditions for analogy in the task of knowledge transfer between machine learning models. Practical verification of the analogy theorem on model data obtained using the Monte Carlo method, as well as on MNIST and USPS data, allows us to achieving F1 scores of 0.84 and 0.88 for convolutional neural networks and random forests, respectively.The proposed approach not only allows us to justify the correctness of transfer between domains but also provides tools for comparing the applicability of models to different types of data.The main contribution of the work is a rigorous formalization of analogy at the level of program logic, providing verifiable guarantees of the correctness of knowledge transfer, which opens new opportunities for both theoretical research and the practical use of machine learning models in previously inaccessible areas.

Abstract: Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- including eye vergence-linked pursuit, speed modulation, and stereotyped approach trajectories -- that closely match real larval zebrafish. Quantitative trajectory analyses show that pursuit bouts systematically reduce prey angle by roughly half before strike, consistent with measurements. Virtual experiments and parameter sweeps vary ecological and energetic constraints, bout kinematics (coupled vs. uncoupled turns and forward motion), and environmental factors such as food density, food speed, and vergence limits. These manipulations reveal how constraints and environments shape pursuit dynamics, strike success, and abort rates, yielding falsifiable predictions for neuroscience experiments. These sweeps identify a compact set of constraints -- binocular sensing, the coupling of forward speed and turning in bout kinematics, and modest energetic costs on locomotion and vergence -- that are sufficient for zebrafish-like hunting to emerge. Strikingly, these behaviors arise in minimal agents without detailed biomechanics, fluid dynamics, circuit realism, or imitation learning from real zebrafish data. Taken together, this work provides a normative account of zebrafish hunting as the optimal balance between energetic cost and sensory benefit, highlighting the trade-offs that structure vergence and trajectory dynamics. We establish a virtual lab that narrows the experimental search space and generates falsifiable predictions about behavior and neural coding.

Abstract: We introduce EmbodiSwap - a method for producing photorealistic synthetic robot overlays over human video. We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$ trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images. Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

<title>Bridging the Gap Between Multimodal Foundation Models and World Models</title>

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information, control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive, editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance.

Abstract: Robots and other intelligent systems navigating in complex dynamic environments should predict future actions and intentions of surrounding agents to reach their goals efficiently and avoid collisions. The dynamics of those agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels. Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents. However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines, and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be preferable.

Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS. Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 -> 3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716 recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results, with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings. ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the 9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support real-world pediatric ECG applications.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

Abstract: Current Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrated with Digital Twin (DT) technology face critical limitations in achieving real-time performance for mission-critical industrial applications. Existing 5G-enabled systems suffer from latencies exceeding 10ms, which are inadequate for applications requiring sub-millisecond response times, such as autonomous industrial control and predictive maintenance. This research aims to develop and validate a 6G-enabled Digital Twin framework that achieves ultra-low latency communication and real-time synchronization between physical industrial assets and their digital counterparts, specifically targeting bearing fault detection as a critical industrial use case. The proposed framework integrates terahertz communications (0.1-1 THz), intelligent reflecting surfaces, and edge artificial intelligence within a five-layer architecture. Experimental validation was conducted using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, implementing comprehensive feature extraction (15 time and frequency domain features) and Random Forest classification algorithms. The system performance was evaluated against traditional WiFi-6 and 5G networks across multiple metrics, including classification accuracy, end-to-end latency, and scalability. It achieved 97.7% fault classification accuracy with 0.8ms end-to-end latency, representing a 15.6x improvement over WiFi-6 (12.5ms) and 5.25x improvement over 5G (4.2ms) networks. The system demonstrated superior scalability with sub-linear processing time growth and maintained consistent performance across four bearing fault categories (normal, inner race, outer race, and ball faults) with macro-averaged F1-scores exceeding 97%.

arXiv:2510.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-dimensional learning, models remain stable until they collapse abruptly once the sample size falls below a critical level. This instability is not algorithm-specific but a geometric mechanism: when the weakest Fisher eigendirection falls beneath sample-level fluctuations, identifiability fails. Our Fisher Threshold Theorem formalizes this by proving that stability requires the minimal Fisher eigenvalue to exceed an explicit $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ bound. Unlike prior asymptotic or model-specific criteria, this threshold is finite-sample and necessary, marking a sharp phase transition between reliable concentration and inevitable failure. To make the principle constructive, we introduce the Fisher floor, a verifiable spectral regularization robust to smoothing and preconditioning. Synthetic experiments on Gaussian mixtures and logistic models confirm the predicted transition, consistent with $d/n$ scaling. Statistically, the threshold sharpens classical eigenvalue conditions into a non-asymptotic law; learning-theoretically, it defines a spectral sample-complexity frontier, bridging theory with diagnostics for robust high-dimensional inference.

Abstract: I present a regression algorithm that provides a continuous, piecewise-smooth function approximating scattered data. It is based on composing and blending linear functions over Voronoi cells, and it scales to high dimensions. The algorithm infers Voronoi cells from seed vertices and constructs a linear function for the input data in and around each cell. As the algorithm does not explicitly compute the Voronoi diagram, it avoids the curse of dimensionality. An accuracy of around 98.2% on the MNIST dataset with 722,200 degrees of freedom (without data augmentation, convolution, or other geometric operators) demonstrates the applicability and scalability of the algorithm.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

Abstract: There are limitations of traditional methods and deep learning methods in terms of interpretability, generalization, and quantification of uncertainty in industrial fault diagnosis, and there are core problems of insufficient credibility in industrial fault diagnosis. The architecture performs preliminary analysis through a Bayesian network-based diagnostic engine and features an LLM-driven cognitive quorum module with multimodal input capabilities. The module conducts expert-level arbitration of initial diagnoses by analyzing structured features and diagnostic charts, prioritizing final decisions after conflicts are identified. To ensure the reliability of the system output, the architecture integrates a confidence calibration module based on temperature calibration and a risk assessment module, which objectively quantifies the reliability of the system using metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE). Experimental results on a dataset containing multiple fault types showed that the proposed framework improved diagnostic accuracy by more than 28 percentage points compared to the baseline model, while the calibrated ECE was reduced by more than 75%. Case studies have confirmed that HCAA effectively corrects misjudgments caused by complex feature patterns or knowledge gaps in traditional models, providing novel and practical engineering solutions for building high-trust, explainable AI diagnostic systems for industrial applications.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and other hypothesis testing methodologies.

Abstract: Manually editing pasted code is a long-standing developer pain point. In internal software development at Google, we observe that code is pasted 4 times more often than it is manually typed. These paste actions frequently require follow-up edits, ranging from simple reformatting and renaming to more complex style adjustments and cross-language translations. Prior work has shown deep learning can be used to predict these edits. In this work, we show how to iteratively develop and scale Smart Paste, an IDE feature for post-paste edit suggestions, to Google's development environment. This experience can serve as a guide for AI practitioners on a holistic approach to feature development, covering user experience, system integration, and model capabilities. Since deployment, Smart Paste has had overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 45% acceptance rate. At Google's enterprise scale, these accepted suggestions account substantially for over 1% of all code written company-wide.

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces, motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game structure for improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini, Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4, StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default, LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95 latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs, and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling, and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy. We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive, and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with targeted LLM assistance.

<title>Adaptive and Explainable AI Agents for Anomaly Detection in Critical IoT Infrastructure using LLM-Enhanced Contextual Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare, energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete, messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive, intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly detection tasks in IoT

Abstract: Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks.

<title>Optimal Computation from Fluctuation Responses</title>

Abstract: The energy cost of computation has emerged as a central challenge at the intersection of physics and computer science. Recent advances in statistical physics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise characterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in information-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent control protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that minimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we develop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation response relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that optimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both using FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on iteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much easier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing equations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a double-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to construct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The framework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by optimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test, the framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work costs comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide principled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in physical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates robust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic biological networks.

Abstract: We present self-speculative masked diffusions, a new class of masked diffusion generative models for discrete data that require significantly fewer function evaluations to generate samples. Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled, however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We apply our method to GPT2 scale text modelling and protein sequences generation, finding that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.

<title>Quantifying Risks in Multi-turn Conversation with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security. Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.

<title>Beyond Static Evaluation: Rethinking the Assessment of Personalized Agent Adaptability in Information Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Personalized AI agents are becoming central to modern information retrieval, yet most evaluation methodologies remain static, relying on fixed benchmarks and one-off metrics that fail to reflect how users' needs evolve over time. These limitations hinder our ability to assess whether agents can meaningfully adapt to individuals across dynamic, longitudinal interactions. In this perspective paper, we propose a conceptual lens for rethinking evaluation in adaptive personalization, shifting the focus from static performance snapshots to interaction-aware, evolving assessments. We organize this lens around three core components: (1) persona-based user simulation with temporally evolving preference models; (2) structured elicitation protocols inspired by reference interviews to extract preferences in context; and (3) adaptation-aware evaluation mechanisms that measure how agent behavior improves across sessions and tasks. While recent works have embraced LLM-driven user simulation, we situate this practice within a broader paradigm for evaluating agents over time. To illustrate our ideas, we conduct a case study in e-commerce search using the PersonalWAB dataset. Beyond presenting a framework, our work lays a conceptual foundation for understanding and evaluating personalization as a continuous, user-centric endeavor.

<title>Keep It on a Leash: Controllable Pseudo-label Generation Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers' tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks under physical limits.

Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities, limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.

Abstract: The growing availability of large and complex datasets has increased interest in temporal stochastic processes that can capture stylized facts such as marginal skewness, non-Gaussian tails, long memory, and even non-Markovian dynamics. While such models are often easy to simulate from, parameter estimation remains challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a promising way forward, but existing methods typically require large training datasets or complex architectures and frequently yield confidence (credible) regions that fail to attain their nominal values, raising doubts on the reliability of estimates for the very features that motivate the use of these models. To address these challenges, we propose a fast and accurate, sample-efficient SBI framework for amortized posterior inference applicable to intractable stochastic processes. The proposed approach relies on two main steps: first, we learn the posterior density by decomposing it sequentially across parameter dimensions. Then, we use Chebyshev polynomial approximations to efficiently generate independent posterior samples, enabling accurate inference even when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods mix poorly. We further develop novel diagnostic tools for SBI in this context, as well as post-hoc calibration techniques; the latter not only lead to performance improvements of the learned inferential tool, but also to the ability to reuse it directly with new time series of varying lengths, thus amortizing the training cost. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on trawl processes, a class of flexible infinitely divisible models that generalize univariate Gaussian processes, applied to energy demand data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods, including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

Abstract: We prove a saturation theorem for linearized shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^d$. For any antipodally quasi-uniform set of centers, if the target function has smoothness $r>\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2}$, then the best $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb S^d)$ approximation cannot converge faster than order $n^{-\frac{d+2k+1}{2d}}$. This lower bound matches existing upper bounds, thereby establishing the exact saturation order $\tfrac{d+2k+1}{2d}$ for such networks. Our results place linearized neural-network approximation firmly within the classical saturation framework and show that, although ReLU$^k$ networks outperform finite elements under equal degrees $k$, this advantage is intrinsically limited.

Abstract: Modern preference alignment techniques, such as Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, rely on reward models trained with pairwise comparison data. While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is \textit{better}, but what is \textit{good enough}. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70\%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22\% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Competitive search is a setting where document publishers modify them to improve their ranking in response to a query. Recently, publishers have increasingly leveraged LLMs to generate and modify competitive content. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Ranker Feedback (RLRF), a framework that trains LLMs using preference datasets derived from ranking competitions. The goal of a publisher (LLM-based) agent is to optimize content for improved ranking while accounting for the strategies of competing agents. We generate the datasets using approaches that do not rely on human-authored data. We show that our proposed agents consistently and substantially outperform previously suggested approaches for LLM-based competitive document modification. We further show that our agents are effective with ranking functions they were not trained for (i.e., out of distribution) and they adapt to strategic opponents. These findings provide support to the significant potential of using reinforcement learning in competitive search.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in information retrieval, underpinning large-scale applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-modal search. Hashing-based methods provide an efficient solution by mapping high-dimensional data into compact binary codes that enable fast similarity computations in Hamming space. Over the past two decades, a substantial body of work has explored learning to hash, where projection and quantisation functions are optimised from data rather than chosen at random.
  This article offers a foundational survey of early learning-based hashing methods, with an emphasis on the core ideas that shaped the field. We review supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches, highlighting how projection functions are designed to generate meaningful embeddings and how quantisation strategies convert these embeddings into binary codes. We also examine extensions to multi-bit and multi-threshold models, as well as early advances in cross-modal retrieval.
  Rather than providing an exhaustive account of the most recent methods, our goal is to introduce the conceptual foundations of learning-based hashing for ANN search. By situating these early models in their historical context, we aim to equip readers with a structured understanding of the principles, trade-offs, and open challenges that continue to inform current research in this area.

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm, culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Autonomous-Distillation/.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation requirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either lack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between utility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play safeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious, each input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate prompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The cloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the real one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a small portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The intermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the targeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device model. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based accelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing computation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and comparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based non-autoregressive (NAR) models have shown strong promise in large language modeling, however, their potential for automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored. We propose Drax, a discrete flow matching framework for ASR that enables efficient parallel decoding. To better align training with inference, we construct an audio-conditioned probability path that guides the model through trajectories resembling likely intermediate inference errors, rather than direct random noise to target transitions. Our theoretical analysis links the generalization gap to divergences between training and inference occupancies, controlled by cumulative velocity errors, thereby motivating our design choice. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach attains recognition accuracy on par with state-of-the-art speech models while offering improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, highlighting discrete flow matching as a promising direction for advancing NAR ASR.

<title>From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) are moving into real applications, where they must be both useful and safe. Safety is especially challenging in multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments, COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices, indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in LMRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose \textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop \textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a 4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of 68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

<title>MASC: Boosting Autoregressive Image Generation with a Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57% and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable generative modeling.

<title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of infrared (IR) and Raman spectra is essential for molecular identification and structural analysis. Traditional quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102 small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across diverse molecular and material systems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy. The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on the RfMiD test set.

Abstract: Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions. We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.

Abstract: The sample complexity of estimating or maximising an unknown function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is known to be linked to both the effective dimension and the information gain associated with the kernel. While the information gain has an attractive information-theoretic interpretation, the effective dimension typically results in better rates. We introduce a new quantity called the relative information gain, which measures the sensitivity of the information gain with respect to the observation noise. We show that the relative information gain smoothly interpolates between the effective dimension and the information gain, and that the relative information gain has the same growth rate as the effective dimension. In the second half of the paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayesian excess risk bound for Gaussian process regression. The relative information gain arises naturally from the complexity term in this PAC-Bayesian bound. We prove bounds on the relative information gain that depend on the spectral properties of the kernel. When these upper bounds are combined with our excess risk bound, we obtain minimax-optimal rates of convergence.

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers scale transformers by routing tokens to a sparse subset of feed-forward experts. Token-level routing, however, assigns an entire semantic spectrum to each expert, creating capacity bottlenecks, load-balancing pathologies, and limited specialization. We introduce SliceMoE, an architecture that routes contiguous slices of a token's hidden vector. A d-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a lightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their assigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining per-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave within an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level capacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels. Experiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three text-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference than dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched token-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over syntactic versus semantic subspaces.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from user opinions across various domains. However, performing sentiment analysis in Persian remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled datasets, limited preprocessing tools, and the lack of high-quality embeddings and feature extraction methods. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for Persian aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In particular, we utilize polarity scores from multilingual BERT as additional features and incorporate them into a decision tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 93.34%-surpassing existing benchmarks on the Pars-ABSA dataset. Additionally, we introduce a Persian synonym and entity dictionary, a novel linguistic resource that supports text augmentation through synonym and named entity replacement. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid modeling and feature augmentation in advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages such as Persian.

Abstract: Large language model multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) offer a promising paradigm for harnessing collective intelligence to achieve more advanced forms of AI behaviour. While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions. We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and benchmarks.

Abstract: Traditional conformal prediction methods construct prediction sets such that the true label falls within the set with a user-specified coverage level. However, poorly chosen coverage levels can result in uninformative predictions, either producing overly conservative sets when the coverage level is too high, or empty sets when it is too low. Moreover, the fixed coverage level cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of each individual example, limiting the flexibility and efficiency of these methods. In this work, we leverage recent advances in e-values and post-hoc conformal inference, which allow the use of data-dependent coverage levels while maintaining valid statistical guarantees. We propose to optimize an adaptive coverage policy by training a neural network using a leave-one-out procedure on the calibration set, allowing the coverage level and the resulting prediction set size to vary with the difficulty of each individual example. We support our approach with theoretical coverage guarantees and demonstrate its practical benefits through a series of experiments.

Abstract: Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers underpin modern quantitative finance, governing option pricing and risk evaluation. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving the forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. However they remain computationally expensive due to their iterative gradient descent based optimization and scale poorly with increasing model size. This paper introduces Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines (PIELMs) as fast alternative to PINNs for solving both forward and inverse problems in financial PDEs. PIELMs replace iterative optimization with a single least-squares solve, enabling deterministic and efficient training. We benchmark PIELM on the Black-Scholes and Heston-Hull-White models for forward pricing and demonstrate its capability in inverse model calibration to recover volatility and interest rate parameters from noisy data. From experiments we observe that PIELM achieve accuracy comparable to PINNs while being up to $30\times$ faster, highlighting their potential for real-time financial modeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural instrument sound synthesis using a two-stage semi-supervised learning framework capable of generating pitch-accurate, high-quality music samples from an expressive timbre latent space. Existing approaches that achieve sufficient quality for music production often rely on high-dimensional latent representations that are difficult to navigate and provide unintuitive user experiences. We address this limitation through a two-stage training paradigm: first, we train a pitch-timbre disentangled 2D representation of audio samples using a Variational Autoencoder; second, we use this representation as conditioning input for a Transformer-based generative model. The learned 2D latent space serves as an intuitive interface for navigating and exploring the sound landscape. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns a disentangled timbre space, enabling expressive and controllable audio generation with reliable pitch conditioning. Experimental results show the model's ability to capture subtle variations in timbre while maintaining a high degree of pitch accuracy. The usability of our method is demonstrated in an interactive web application, highlighting its potential as a step towards future music production environments that are both intuitive and creatively empowering: https://pgesam.faresschulz.com

Abstract: Indoor LoRaWAN propagation is shaped by structural and time-varying context factors, which challenge log-distance models and the assumption of log-normal shadowing. We present an environment-aware, statistically disciplined path loss framework evaluated using leakage-safe cross-validation on a 12-month campaign in an eighth-floor office measuring 240 m^2. A log-distance multi-wall mean is augmented with environmental covariates (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), as well as the signal-to-noise ratio. We compare multiple linear regression with regularized variants, Bayesian linear regression, and a selective second-order polynomial applied to continuous drivers. Predictor relevance is established using heteroscedasticity-robust Type II and III analysis of variance and nested partial F tests. Shadow fading is profiled with kernel density estimation and non-parametric families, including Normal, Skew-Normal, Student's t, and Gaussian mixtures. The polynomial mean reduces cross-validated RMSE from 8.07 to 7.09 dB and raises R^2 from 0.81 to 0.86. Out-of-fold residuals are non-Gaussian; a 3-component mixture captures a sharp core with a light, broad tail. We convert accuracy into reliability by prescribing the fade margin as the upper-tail quantile of cross-validated residuals, quantifying uncertainty via a moving-block bootstrap, and validating on a held-out set. At 99% packet delivery ratio, the environment-aware polynomial requires 25.7 dB versus 27.7 to 27.9 dB for linear baselines.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of workflows and methods for software engineering using AI emphasizes the need for a systematic evaluation and analysis of their ability to leverage information from entire projects, particularly in large code bases. In this challenge on optimization of context collection for code completion, organized by JetBrains in collaboration with Mistral AI as part of the ASE 2025 conference, participants developed efficient mechanisms for collecting context from source code repositories to improve fill-in-the-middle code completions for Python and Kotlin. We constructed a large dataset of real-world code in these two programming languages using permissively licensed open-source projects. The submissions were evaluated based on their ability to maximize completion quality for multiple state-of-the-art neural models using the chrF metric. During the public phase of the competition, nineteen teams submitted solutions to the Python track and eight teams submitted solutions to the Kotlin track. In the private phase, six teams competed, of which five submitted papers to the workshop.

Abstract: In this paper, for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unbounded state spaces we present refined upper bounds presented in [Kara et. al. JMLR'23] on finite model approximation errors via optimizing the quantizers used for finite model approximations. We also consider implications on quantizer design for quantized Q-learning and empirical model learning, and the performance of policies obtained via Q-learning where the quantized state is treated as the state itself. We highlight the distinctions between planning, where approximating MDPs can be independently designed, and learning (either via Q-learning or empirical model learning), where approximating MDPs are restricted to be defined by invariant measures of Markov chains under exploration policies, leading to significant subtleties on quantizer design performance, even though asymptotic near optimality can be established under both setups. In particular, under Lyapunov growth conditions, we obtain explicit upper bounds which decay to zero as the number of bins approaches infinity.

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes is a central component of adaptive immunity, with implications for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune disease. While recent advances in machine learning have improved prediction of TCR-pMHC binding, the most effective approaches are black-box transformer models that cannot provide a rationale for predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods can provide insight with respect to the input but do not explicitly model biochemical mechanisms (e.g. known binding regions), as in TCR-pMHC binding. ``Explain-by-design'' models (i.e., with architectural components that can be examined directly after training) have been explored in other domains, but have not been used for TCR-pMHC binding. We propose explainable model layers (TCR-EML) that can be incorporated into protein-language model backbones for TCR-pMHC modeling. Our approach uses prototype layers for amino acid residue contacts drawn from known TCR-pMHC binding mechanisms, enabling high-quality explanations for predicted TCR-pMHC binding. Experiments of our proposed method on large-scale datasets demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy and generalization, and evaluation on the TCR-XAI benchmark demonstrates improved explainability compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users expect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries. However, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to variability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and reliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the requirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically equivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that decomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and end-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve consistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization (PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased set to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve Information Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce consistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to retrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase sets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation method that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale training. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA benchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and accuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth supervision. Our work provides practical solutions for evaluating and building reliable RAG systems for safety-critical deployments.

<title>Time Is Effort: Estimating Human Post-Editing Time for Grammar Error Correction Tool Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Text editing can involve several iterations of revision. Incorporating an efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality. This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET) for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool usability. We release our dataset and code at: https://github.com/ankitvad/PEET_Scorer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at https://github.com/Buyun-Liang/SECA.

arXiv:2510.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit, utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve learnability.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. However, existing methods treat the entire modeling process as a black box, overlooking opportunities to exploit modular structure. We introduce a conformal prediction framework for two-stage sequential models, where an upstream predictor generates intermediate representations for a downstream model. By decomposing the overall prediction residual into stage-specific components, our method enables practitioners to attribute uncertainty to specific pipeline stages. We develop a risk-controlled parameter selection procedure using family-wise error rate (FWER) control to calibrate stage-wise scaling parameters, and propose an adaptive extension for non-stationary settings that preserves long-run coverage guarantees. Experiments on synthetic distribution shifts, as well as real-world supply chain and stock market data, demonstrate that our approach maintains coverage under conditions that degrade standard conformal methods, while providing interpretable stage-wise uncertainty attribution. This framework offers diagnostic advantages and robust coverage that standard conformal methods lack.

<title>Scale-Invariant Regret Matching and Online Learning with Optimal Convergence: Bridging Theory and Practice in Zero-Sum Games</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04407</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A considerable chasm has been looming for decades between theory and practice in zero-sum game solving through first-order methods. Although a convergence rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can exhibit slower $\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play.
  In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ (i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive* learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\ell_2$-)norm of the regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate -- can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.
  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.

<title>Learning Survival Models with Right-Censored Reporting Delays</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the time until an event occurs. Although it is applied across a wide range of fields, adjusting for reporting delays under practical constraints remains a significant challenge in the insurance industry. Such delays render event occurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring. This issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly enrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our study addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard functions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability distribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We construct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to compute its estimates. Using these findings, we propose a two-stage estimation procedure based on a parametric proportional hazards model to evaluate observations subject to administrative censoring. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the timeliness of risk evaluation for newly enrolled cohorts.

Abstract: We present spd-metrics-id, a Python package for computing distances and divergences between symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. Unlike traditional toolkits that focus on specific applications, spd-metrics-id provides a unified, extensible, and reproducible framework for SPD distance computation. The package supports a wide variety of geometry-aware metrics, including Alpha-z Bures-Wasserstein, Alpha-Procrustes, affine-invariant Riemannian, log-Euclidean, and others, and is accessible both via a command-line interface and a Python API. Reproducibility is ensured through Docker images and Zenodo archiving. We illustrate usage through a connectome fingerprinting example, but the package is broadly applicable to covariance analysis, diffusion tensor imaging, and other domains requiring SPD matrix comparison. The package is openly available at https://pypi.org/project/spd-metrics-id/.

Abstract: This work aims to solve a stochastic nonconvex nonsmooth composite optimization problem. Previous works on composite optimization problem requires the major part to satisfy Lipschitz smoothness or some relaxed smoothness conditions, which excludes some machine learning examples such as regularized ReLU network and sparse support matrix machine. In this work, we focus on stochastic nonconvex composite optimization problem without any smoothness assumptions. In particular, we propose two new notions of approximate stationary points for such optimization problem and obtain finite-time convergence results of two zeroth-order algorithms to these two approximate stationary points respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that these algorithms are effective using numerical experiments.

Abstract: In mixed-integer linear programming, data-driven inverse optimization that learns the objective function and the constraints from observed data plays an important role in constructing appropriate mathematical models for various fields, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known method for learning both the objective functions and the constraints. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for a class of problems where the objective function is expressed as a linear combination of functions and the constraints are represented by functions and thresholds. Specifically, our method first learns the constraints and then learns the objective function. On the theoretical side, we show the proposed method can solve inverse optimization problems in finite dataset, develop statistical learning theory in pseudometric spaces and sub-Gaussian distributions, and construct a statistical learning for inverse optimization. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method is practically applicable for scheduling problems formulated as integer linear programmings with up to 100 decision variables, which are typical in real-world settings.

Unlike prior surveys on this topic, our focus is on giving a self-contained presentation of all known alternative constructions of Eldan's stochastic localization, with an emphasis on connections between different constructions. Our hope is that by collecting these perspectives, some of which had primarily arisen within a particular community (e.g., probability theory, theoretical computer science, information theory, or machine learning), we can broaden the accessibility of stochastic localization, and ease its future use.

Abstract: Physics-based atmosphere-land models with prescribed sea surface temperature have notable successes but also biases in their ability to represent atmospheric variability compared to observations. Recently, AI emulators and hybrid models have emerged with the potential to overcome these biases, but still require systematic evaluation against metrics grounded in fundamental atmospheric dynamics. Here, we evaluate the representation of four atmospheric variability benchmarking metrics in a fully data-driven AI emulator (ACE2-ERA5) and hybrid model (NeuralGCM). The hybrid model and emulator can capture the spectra of large-scale tropical waves and extratropical eddy-mean flow interactions, including critical levels. However, both struggle to capture the timescales associated with quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO, $\sim 28$ months) and Southern annular mode propagation ($\sim 150$ days). These dynamical metrics serve as an initial benchmarking tool to inform AI model development and understand their limitations, which may be essential for out-of-distribution applications (e.g., extrapolating to unseen climates).

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity, they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment. Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$ on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed. Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large, pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries.

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group, shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a 1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\% performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers are fundamental to engineering simulation. Classical mesh-based approaches (finite difference/volume/element) are fast and accurate on high-quality meshes but struggle with higher-order operators and complex, hard-to-mesh geometries. Recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants are mesh-free and flexible, yet compute-intensive and often less accurate. This paper systematically benchmarks RBF-PIELM, a rapid PINN variant-an extreme learning machine with radial-basis activations-for higher-order PDEs. RBF-PIELM replaces PINNs' time-consuming gradient descent with a single-shot least-squares solve. We test RBF-PIELM on the fourth-order biharmonic equation using two benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flow (streamfunction formulation) and a manufactured oscillatory solution. Our results show up to $(350\times)$ faster training than PINNs and over $(10\times)$ fewer parameters for comparable solution accuracy. Despite surpassing PINNs, RBF-PIELM still lags mature mesh-based solvers and its accuracy degrades on highly oscillatory solutions, highlighting remaining challenges for practical deployment.

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems leverage neighborhood aggregation to generate node representations, which is highly sensitive to popularity bias, resulting in an echo effect during information propagation. Existing graph-based debiasing solutions refine the aggregation process with attempts such as edge reconstruction or weight adjustment. However, these methods remain inadequate in fully alleviating popularity bias. Specifically, this is because 1) they provide no insights into graph aggregation rationality, thus lacking an optimality guarantee; 2) they fail to well balance the training and debiasing process, which undermines the effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate popularity bias through rational modeling of the graph aggregation process. We reveal that graph aggregation is a special form of backdoor adjustment in causal inference, where the aggregation weight corresponds to the historical interaction likelihood distribution. Based on this insight, we devise an encoder-decoder architecture, namely Causality-aware Graph Aggregation Weight Estimator for Debiasing (CAGED), to approximate the unbiased aggregation weight by optimizing the evidence lower bound of the interaction likelihood. In order to enhance the debiasing effectiveness during early training stages, we further design a momentum update strategy that incrementally refines the aggregation weight matrix. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CAGED outperforms existing graph-based debiasing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/CAGED.

Abstract: Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have been implemented in numerous cities, becoming integral to daily life. However, a prevalent issue arises when intensive commuting demand leads to bicycle shortages in specific areas and at particular times. To address this challenge, we employ a novel quantum machine learning model that analyzes time series data by fitting quantum time evolution to observed sequences. This model enables us to capture actual trends in bicycle counts at individual ports and identify correlations between different ports. Utilizing the trained model, we simulate the impact of proactively adding bicycles to high-demand ports on the overall rental number across the system. Given that the core of this method lies in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is anticipated to have a wide range of industrial applications.

<title>Learning Linear Regression with Low-Rank Tasks in-Context</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable witness-based persistent homology pipeline for full-brain MRI volumes that couples density-aware landmark selection with a GPU-ready witness filtration. Candidates are scored by a hybrid metric that balances geometric coverage against inverse kernel density, yielding landmark sets that shrink mean pairwise distances by 30-60% over random or density-only baselines while preserving topological features. Benchmarks on BrainWeb, IXI, and synthetic manifolds execute in under ten seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of Cech, Vietoris-Rips, and alpha filtrations. The package is distributed on PyPI as whale-tda (installable via pip); source and issues are hosted at https://github.com/jorgeLRW/whale. The release also exposes a fast preset (mri_deep_dive_fast) for exploratory sweeps, and ships with reproducibility-focused scripts and artifacts for drop-in use in medical imaging workflows.

Abstract: In a dynamic landscape where portfolios and environments evolve, maintaining the accuracy of pricing models is critical. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine concept drift in non-life insurance pricing. We (i) provide an overview of the relevant literature and commonly used methodologies, clarify the distinction between virtual drift and concept drift, and explain their implications for long-run model performance; (ii) review and formalize common performance measures, including the Gini index and deviance loss, and articulate their interpretation; (iii) derive the asymptotic distribution of the Gini index, enabling valid inference and hypothesis testing; and (iv) present a standardized monitoring procedure that indicates when refitting is warranted. We illustrate the framework using a modified real-world portfolio with induced concept drift and discuss practical considerations and pitfalls.

<title>COSMIR: Chain Orchestrated Structured Memory for Iterative Reasoning over Long Context</title>

Abstract: Reasoning over very long inputs remains difficult for large language models (LLMs). Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking missed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage multiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents, CoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and amplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured Memory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc messages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query into concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a fixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared memory. A Manager agent then Synthesizes the final answer directly from the memory. This preserves step-wise read-then-reason benefits while changing both the communication medium (structured memory) and the worker procedure (fixed micro-cycle), yielding higher faithfulness, better long-range aggregation, and auditability. On long-context QA from the HELMET suite, COSMIR reduces propagation-stage information loss and improves accuracy over a CoA baseline.

<title>Language Model Based Text-to-Audio Generation: Anti-Causally Aligned Collaborative Residual Transformers</title>

Abstract: While language models (LMs) paired with residual vector quantization (RVQ) tokenizers have shown promise in text-to-audio (T2A) generation, they still lag behind diffusion-based models by a non-trivial margin. We identify a critical dilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio reconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional LMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key limitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective LMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ layers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these insights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple isolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren outperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving state-of-the-art results. By bridging the representational strengths of LMs with the fidelity demands of audio synthesis, our approach repositions LMs as competitive contenders against diffusion models in T2A tasks. Moreover, by aligning audio representations with linguistic structures, Siren facilitates a promising pathway toward unified multi-modal generation frameworks.

Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven PID controller design based on the principle of adaptive gain optimization, leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) generated for predictive modeling purposes. The proposed control design method utilizes gradients of the PID gain optimization, achieved through the automatic differentiation of PINNs, to apply model predictive control using a cost function based on tracking error and control inputs. By optimizing PINNs-based PID gains, the method achieves adaptive gain tuning that ensures stability while accounting for system nonlinearities. The proposed method features a systematic framework for integrating PINNs-based models of dynamical control systems into closed-loop control systems, enabling direct application to PID control design. A series of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from the control perspectives based on both time and frequency domains.

Abstract: Wasserstein barycenters provide a powerful tool for aggregating probability measures, while leveraging the geometry of their ambient space. Existing discrete methods suffer from poor scalability, as they require access to the complete set of samples from input measures. We address this issue by recasting the original barycenter problem as a gradient flow in the Wasserstein space. Our approach offers two advantages. First, we achieve scalability by sampling mini-batches from the input measures. Second, we incorporate functionals over probability measures, which regularize the barycenter problem through internal, potential, and interaction energies. We present two algorithms for empirical and Gaussian mixture measures, providing convergence guarantees under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. Experimental validation on toy datasets and domain adaptation benchmarks show that our methods outperform previous discrete and neural net-based methods for computing Wasserstein barycenters.

<title>A Case for Declarative LLM-friendly Interfaces for Improved Efficiency of Computer-Use Agents</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to automating computer tasks, yet they struggle with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls.
  We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs. Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism). GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs).
  We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows. Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%. Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making model where a set of items is repeatedly matched to the same set of agents over multiple rounds. The objective is to determine a sequence of matchings that either maximizes the utility of the least advantaged agent at the end of all rounds (optimal) or at the end of every individual round (anytime optimal). We investigate the computational challenges associated with finding (anytime) optimal outcomes and demonstrate that these problems are generally computationally intractable. However, we provide approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and identify several special cases whereby the problem(s) can be solved efficiently. Along the way, we also establish characterizations of Pareto-optimal/maximum matchings, which may be of independent interest to works in matching theory and house allocation.

<title>Evaluating LLMs for Demographic-Targeted Social Bias Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study</title>

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

Abstract: Music Emotion Recognition (MER) is a task deeply connected to human perception, relying heavily on subjective annotations collected from contributors. Prior studies tend to focus on specific musical styles rather than incorporating a diverse range of genres, such as rock and classical, within a single framework. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing emotion from audio content by investigating five datasets with dimensional emotion annotations -- EmoMusic, DEAM, PMEmo, WTC, and WCMED -- which span various musical styles. We demonstrate the problem of out-of-distribution generalization in a systematic experiment. By closely looking at multiple data and feature sets, we provide insight into genre-emotion relationships in existing data and examine potential genre dominance and dataset biases in certain feature representations. Based on these experiments, we arrive at a simple yet effective framework that combines embeddings extracted from the Jukebox model with chroma features and demonstrate how, alongside a combination of several diverse training sets, this permits us to train models with substantially improved cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained, state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.

<title>BrokenMath: A Benchmark for Sycophancy in Theorem Proving with LLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025 competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

Abstract: This article proposes predictive economics as a distinct analytical perspective within economics, grounded in machine learning and centred on predictive accuracy rather than causal identification. Drawing on the instrumentalist tradition (Friedman), the explanation-prediction divide (Shmueli), and the contrast between modelling cultures (Breiman), we formalise prediction as a valid epistemological and methodological objective. Reviewing recent applications across economic subfields, we show how predictive models contribute to empirical analysis, particularly in complex or data-rich contexts. This perspective complements existing approaches and supports a more pluralistic methodology - one that values out-of-sample performance alongside interpretability and theoretical structure.

Abstract: We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2% of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original, while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.

Abstract: A generic D-dimensional Gaussian can be conditioned or projected onto the D-1 unit sphere, thereby leading to the well-known Fisher-Bingham (FB) or Angular Gaussian (AG) distribution families, respectively. These are some of the most fundamental distributions on the sphere, yet cannot straightforwardly be written as a normalizing flow except in two special cases: the von-Mises Fisher in D=3 and the central angular Gaussian in any D. In this paper, we describe how to generalize these special cases to a family of normalizing flows that behave similarly to the full FB or AG family in any D. We call them "zoom-linear-project" (ZLP)-Fisher flows. Unlike a normal Fisher-Bingham distribution, their composition allows to gradually add complexity as needed. Furthermore, they can naturally handle conditional density estimation with target distributions that vary by orders of magnitude in scale - a setting that is important in astronomical applications but that existing flows often struggle with. A particularly useful member of the new family is the Kent analogue that can cheaply upgrade any flow in this situation to yield better performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data, the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate high-dimensional kernel ridge regression (KRR) on i.i.d. Gaussian data with anisotropic power-law covariance. This setting differs fundamentally from the classical source & capacity conditions for KRR, where power-law assumptions are typically imposed on the kernel eigen-spectrum itself. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive an explicit characterization of the kernel spectrum for polynomial inner-product kernels, giving a precise description of how the kernel eigen-spectrum inherits the data decay. Second, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the excess risk in the high-dimensional regime for a particular kernel with this spectral behavior, showing that the sample complexity is governed by the effective dimension of the data rather than the ambient dimension. These results establish a fundamental advantage of learning with power-law anisotropic data over isotropic data. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous treatment of non-linear KRR under power-law data.

Abstract: Understanding signal behavior across scales is vital in areas such as natural phenomena analysis and financial modeling. A key property is self-similarity, quantified by the Hurst exponent (H), which reveals long-term dependencies. Wavelet-based methods are effective for estimating H due to their multi-scale analysis capability, but additive noise in real-world measurements often degrades accuracy. We propose Noise-Controlled ALPHEE (NC-ALPHEE), an enhancement of the Average Level-Pairwise Hurst Exponent Estimator (ALPHEE), incorporating noise mitigation and generating multiple level-pairwise estimates from signal energy pairs. A neural network (NN) combines these estimates, replacing traditional averaging. This adaptive learning maintains ALPHEE's behavior in noise-free cases while improving performance in noisy conditions. Extensive simulations show that in noise-free data, NC-ALPHEE matches ALPHEE's accuracy using both averaging and NN-based methods. Under noise, however, traditional averaging deteriorates and requires impractical level restrictions, while NC-ALPHEE consistently outperforms existing techniques without such constraints. NC-ALPHEE offers a robust, adaptive approach for H estimation, significantly enhancing the reliability of wavelet-based methods in noisy environments.

<title>Beyond Random: Automatic Inner-loop Optimization in Dataset Distillation</title>

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior. AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods. Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving 63% memory cost.

Abstract: We introduce LEGOMem, a modular procedural memory framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems in workflow automation. LEGOMem decomposes past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved, and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory design in multi-agent workflow automation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques: early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other contexts.

arXiv:2510.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes, which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed, multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes.

Abstract: Prompt injection poses a serious threat to the reliability and safety of LLM agents. Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contexts where their failures can have direct sociopolitical consequences. Yet, existing safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as 97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts, and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA, and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/psyonp/SocialHarmBench.

Abstract: Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference, while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation, while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.

Abstract: Set-valued classification is used in multiclass settings where confusion between classes can occur and lead to misleading predictions. However, its application may amplify discriminatory bias motivating the development of set-valued approaches under fairness constraints. In this paper, we address the problem of set-valued classification under demographic parity and expected size constraints. We propose two complementary strategies: an oracle-based method that minimizes classification risk while satisfying both constraints, and a computationally efficient proxy that prioritizes constraint satisfaction. For both strategies, we derive closed-form expressions for the (optimal) fair set-valued classifiers and use these to build plug-in, data-driven procedures for empirical predictions. We establish distribution-free convergence rates for violations of the size and fairness constraints for both methods, and under mild assumptions we also provide excess-risk bounds for the oracle-based approach. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of both strategies and highlight the efficiency of our proxy method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement. Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance, enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral, Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

It pairs fast parent selection with iterative Cholesky-based score updates, cutting run-times over prior algorithms. This makes it feasible to fully embrace discrete search, enabling iterated local search with principled order initialization to find graphs with scores at or close to the global optimum. The resulting structures are highly accurate across benchmarks, with near-perfect recovery in standard settings. This performance calls for revisiting discrete search over graphs as a reasonable approach to causal discovery.

Abstract: In this paper, we study fluctuations of conditionally centered statistics of the form $$N^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(g(\sigma_i)-\mathbb{E}_N[g(\sigma_i)|\sigma_j,j\neq i])$$ where $(\sigma_1,\ldots ,\sigma_N)$ are sampled from a dependent random field, and $g$ is some bounded function. Our first main result shows that under weak smoothness assumptions on the conditional means (which cover both sparse and dense interactions), the above statistic converges to a Gaussian \emph{scale mixture} with a random scale determined by a \emph{quadratic variance} and an \emph{interaction component}. We also show that under appropriate studentization, the limit becomes a pivotal Gaussian. We leverage this theory to develop a general asymptotic framework for maximum pseudolikelihood (MPLE) inference in dependent random fields. We apply our results to Ising models with pairwise as well as higher-order interactions and exponential random graph models (ERGMs). In particular, we obtain a joint central limit theorem for the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters via the joint MPLE (to our knowledge, the first such result in dense, irregular regimes), and we derive conditionally centered edge CLTs and marginal MPLE CLTs for ERGMs without restricting to the ``sub-critical" region. Our proof is based on a method of moments approach via combinatorial decision-tree pruning, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the context of the narrative.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.

<title>Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding</title>

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obtain categorical proofs and generalizations of existing results on causal abstractions. Using string diagrammatical tools, we can explicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a low-level graph under interventions. We discuss how methods from mechanistic interpretability, such as circuit analysis and sparse autoencoders, fit within our categorical framework. We also show how applying do-calculus on a high-level graphical abstraction of an acyclic-directed mixed graph (ADMG), when unobserved confounders are present, gives valid results on the low-level graph, thus generalizing an earlier statement by Anand et al. (2023). We argue that our framework is more suitable for modeling causal abstractions compared to existing categorical frameworks. Finally, we discuss how notions such as $\tau$-consistency and constructive $\tau$-abstractions can be recovered with our framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new mathematical optimization model for multiclass classification based on arrangements of hyperplanes. Our approach preserves the core support vector machine (SVM) paradigm of maximizing class separation while minimizing misclassification errors, and it is computationally more efficient than a previous formulation. We present a kernel-based extension that allows it to construct nonlinear decision boundaries. Furthermore, we show how the framework can naturally incorporate alternative geometric structures, including classification trees, $\ell_p$-SVMs, and models with discrete feature selection. To address large-scale instances, we develop a dynamic clustering matheuristic that leverages the proposed MIP formulation. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model and dynamic clustering heuristic, and we report competitive classification performance on both synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comparing our method with state-of-the-art implementations available in scikit-learn.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

Abstract: We study the process-level dynamics of Thompson sampling in the ``small gap'' regime. The small gap regime is one in which the gaps between the arm means are of order $\sqrt{\gamma}$ or smaller and the time horizon is of order $1/\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is small. As $\gamma \downarrow 0$, we show that the process-level dynamics of Thompson sampling converge weakly to the solutions to certain stochastic differential equations and stochastic ordinary differential equations. Our weak convergence theory is developed from first principles using the Continuous Mapping Theorem, can handle stationary, weakly dependent reward processes, and can also be adapted to analyze a variety of sampling-based bandit algorithms. Indeed, we show that the process-level dynamics of many sampling-based bandit algorithms -- including Thompson sampling designed for any single-parameter exponential family of rewards, as well as non-parametric bandit algorithms based on bootstrap re-sampling -- satisfy an invariance principle. Namely, their weak limits coincide with that of Gaussian parametric Thompson sampling with Gaussian priors. Moreover, in the small gap regime, the regret performance of these algorithms is generally insensitive to model mis-specification, changing continuously with increasing degrees of mis-specification.

Abstract: Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool and is often deployed in settings which repeatedly solve similar instances of the same problem. Amortized optimization methods use learning to predict the solutions to problems in these settings, exploiting the shared structure between similar problem instances. These methods have been crucial in variational inference and reinforcement learning and are capable of solving optimization problems many orders of magnitudes faster than traditional optimization methods that do not use amortization. This tutorial presents an introduction to the amortized optimization foundations behind these advancements and overviews their applications in variational inference, sparse coding, gradient-based meta-learning, control, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, optimal transport, and deep equilibrium networks. The source code for this tutorial is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/amortized-optimization-tutorial.

Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the convex conjugate (also known as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate or c-transform) that appears in Euclidean Wasserstein-2 optimal transport. This conjugation is considered difficult to compute and in practice, methods are limited by not being able to exactly conjugate the dual potentials in continuous space. To overcome this, the computation of the conjugate can be approximated with amortized optimization, which learns a model to predict the conjugate. I show that combining amortized approximations to the conjugate with a solver for fine-tuning significantly improves the quality of transport maps learned for the Wasserstein-2 benchmark by Korotin et al. (2021a) and is able to model many 2-dimensional couplings and flows considered in the literature.

Abstract: Self-attributing neural networks (SANNs) present a potential path towards interpretable models for high-dimensional problems, but often face significant trade-offs in performance. In this work, we formally prove a lower bound on errors of per-feature SANNs, whereas group-based SANNs can achieve zero error and thus high performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a framework that transforms any differentiable model into a group-based SANN, where feature groups are learned end-to-end without group supervision. SOP achieves state-of-the-art performance for SANNs on vision and language tasks, and we validate that the groups are interpretable on a range of quantitative and semantic metrics. We further validate the utility of SOP explanations in model debugging and cosmological scientific discovery. Our code is available at https://github.com/BrachioLab/sop

Abstract: LiNGAM determines the variable order from cause to effect using additive noise models, but it faces challenges with confounding. Previous methods maintained LiNGAM's fundamental structure while trying to identify and address variables affected by confounding. As a result, these methods required significant computational resources regardless of the presence of confounding, and they did not ensure the detection of all confounding types. In contrast, this paper enhances LiNGAM by introducing LiNGAM-MMI, a method that quantifies the magnitude of confounding using KL divergence and arranges the variables to minimize its impact. This method efficiently achieves a globally optimal variable order through the shortest path problem formulation. LiNGAM-MMI processes data as efficiently as traditional LiNGAM in scenarios without confounding while effectively addressing confounding situations. Our experimental results suggest that LiNGAM-MMI more accurately determines the correct variable order, both in the presence and absence of confounding.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), while a breakthrough in decentralized machine learning, contends with significant challenges such as limited data availability and the variability of computational resources, which can stifle the performance and scalability of the models. The integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into FL presents a compelling solution to these issues, with the potential to enhance data richness and reduce computational demands through pre-training and data augmentation. However, this incorporation introduces novel issues in terms of robustness, privacy, and fairness, which have not been sufficiently addressed in the existing research. We make a preliminary investigation into this field by systematically evaluating the implications of FM-FL integration across these dimensions. We analyze the trade-offs involved, uncover the threats and issues introduced by this integration, and propose a set of criteria and strategies for navigating these challenges. Furthermore, we identify potential research directions for advancing this field, laying a foundation for future development in creating reliable, secure, and equitable FL systems.

Abstract: Tabular data represent one of the most prevalent data formats in applied machine learning, largely because they accommodate a broad spectrum of real-world problems. Existing literature has studied many of the shortcomings of neural architectures on tabular data and has repeatedly confirmed the scalability and robustness of gradient-boosted decision trees across varied datasets. However, recent deep learning models have not been subjected to a comprehensive evaluation under conditions that allow for a fair comparison with existing classical approaches. This situation motivates an investigation into whether recent deep-learning paradigms outperform classical ML methods on tabular data. Our survey fills this gap by benchmarking seventeen state-of-the-art methods, spanning neural networks, classical ML and AutoML techniques. Our empirical results over 68 diverse datasets from a well-established benchmark indicate a paradigm shift, where Deep Learning methods outperform classical approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based methods for constructing solutions to combinatorial optimization problems are rapidly approaching the performance of human-designed algorithms. To further narrow the gap, learning-based approaches must efficiently explore the solution space during the search process. Recent approaches artificially increase exploration by enforcing diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules, however, these rules can impair solution quality and are difficult to design for more complex problems. In this paper, we introduce PolyNet, an approach for improving exploration of the solution space by learning complementary solution strategies. In contrast to other works, PolyNet uses only a single-decoder and a training schema that does not enforce diverse solution generation through handcrafted rules. We evaluate PolyNet on four combinatorial optimization problems and observe that the implicit diversity mechanism allows PolyNet to find better solutions than approaches that explicitly enforce diverse solution generation.

<title>What is Intelligence? A Cycle Closure Perspective</title>

Abstract: What is intelligence? We argue for a structural-dynamical account rooted in a topological closure law: \emph{the boundary of a boundary vanishes} ($\partial^2=0$). This principle forces transient fragments to cancel while closed cycles persist as invariants, yielding the cascade $\partial^2\!=\!0 \Rightarrow \text{cycles (invariants)} \Rightarrow \text{memory} \Rightarrow \text{prediction (intelligence)}$. Prediction requires invariance: only order-invariant cycles can stabilize the predictive substrate. This motivates the \textbf{Structure-before-Specificity (SbS)} principle, where persistent structures ($\Phi$) must stabilize before contextual specificities ($\Psi$) can be meaningfully interpreted, and is formalized by the \textbf{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP)}, which casts cognition as dynamic alignment that minimizes the joint uncertainty $H(\Phi,\Psi)$. We show that \textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)} is the computational mechanism that implements SbS\,$\rightarrow$\,CCUP through dual bootstrapping: \emph{temporal} bootstrapping consolidates episodic specifics into reusable latent trajectories, while \emph{spatial} bootstrapping reuses these invariants across latent manifolds. This framework explains why \emph{semantics precedes syntax}: stable cycles anchor meaning, and symbolic syntax emerges only after semantic invariants are in place. In an evolutionary perspective, the same closure law unifies the trajectory of natural intelligence: from primitive memory traces in microbes, to cyclic sensorimotor patterns in bilaterians, to semantic generalization in mammals, culminating in human symbolic abstraction by natural language. In sum, intelligence arises from the progressive collapse of specificity into structure, grounded in the closure-induced emergence of invariants.

Abstract: Convergence of Q-learning has been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades. Recently, an asymptotic convergence analysis for Q-learning was introduced using a switching system framework. This approach applies the so-called ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach to prove the convergence of the asynchronous Q-learning modeled as a continuous-time switching system, where notions from switching system theory are used to prove its asymptotic stability without using explicit Lyapunov arguments. However, to prove stability, restrictive conditions, such as quasi-monotonicity, must be satisfied for the underlying switching systems, which makes it hard to easily generalize the analysis method to other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the smooth Q-learning variants. In this paper, we present a more general and unified convergence analysis that improves upon the switching system approach and can analyze Q-learning and its smooth variants. The proposed analysis is motivated by previous work on the convergence of synchronous Q-learning based on $p$-norm serving as a Lyapunov function. However, the proposed analysis addresses more general ODE models that can cover both asynchronous Q-learning and its smooth versions with simpler frameworks.

Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we first estimate the underlying velocity field and use the Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating discrete approximations of the characteristics. A deep neural network is then trained to fit these characteristics, creating a one-step map that pushes a simple Gaussian distribution to the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the errors arising from velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate in the 2-Wasserstein distance under mild data assumptions. Crucially, we demonstrate that under a standard manifold assumption, this convergence rate depends only on the intrinsic dimension of data rather than the much larger ambient dimension, proving our model's ability to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous convergence analysis for a flow-based one-step generative model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high-quality and high-resolution sample generation with the efficiency of just a single neural network evaluation.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) was recently proposed to securely train models with data held over multiple locations (``clients'') under the coordination of a central server. Prolonged training times caused by slow clients may hinder the performance of FL; while asynchronous communication is a promising solution, highly heterogeneous client response times under non-IID local data may introduce significant bias to the global model, particularly in client-driven setups where sampling is infeasible. To address this issue, we propose \underline{A}synch\underline{R}onous \underline{E}xact \underline{A}veraging (\textsc{AREA}), a stochastic (sub)gradient method that leverages asynchrony for scalability and uses client-side memory to correct the bias induced by uneven participation, without client sampling or prior knowledge of client latencies. \textsc{AREA} communicates model residuals rather than gradient estimates, reducing exposure to gradient inversion, and is compatible with secure aggregation. Under standard assumptions and unbounded, heterogeneous delays with finite mean, AREA achieves optimal convergence rates: $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ in the strongly convex, smooth regime and $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ in the convex, nonsmooth regime. For strongly convex, smooth objectives, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that AREA accommodates larger step sizes than existing methods, enabling fast convergence without adversely impacting model generalization. In the convex, nonsmooth setting, to our knowledge we are the first to obtain rates that scale with the average client update frequency rather than the minimum or maximum, indicating increased robustness to outliers.

Abstract: Given the ability to model more realistic and dynamic problems, Federated Continual Learning (FCL) has been increasingly investigated recently. A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to deal with different modalities in the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach. Specifically, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and - by retraining the model on such samples - we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings while maintaining data confidentiality and competitive communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Backpropagation, a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is widely considered biologically implausible, because it relies on precise symmetry between feedforward and feedback weights to accurately propagate gradient signals that assign credit. The so-called weight transport problem concerns how biological brains learn to align feedforward and feedback paths while avoiding the non-biological transport of feedforward weights into feedback weights. To address this, several credit assignment algorithms, such as feedback alignment and the Kollen-Pollack rule, have been proposed. While they can achieve the desired weight alignment, these algorithms imply that if a neuron sends a feedforward synapse to another neuron, it should also receive an identical or at least partially correlated feedback synapse from the latter neuron, thereby forming a bidirectional connection. However, this idealized connectivity pattern contradicts experimental observations in the brain, a discrepancy we refer to as the weight symmetry problem. To address this challenge posed by considering biological constraints on connectivity, we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. We demonstrate that PFA can eliminate explicit weight symmetry entirely while closely approximating backpropagation and achieving comparable performance in deep convolutional networks. Our results offer a novel approach to solve the longstanding problem of credit assignment in the brain, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep networks compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.

<title>Optimal Bound for PCA with Outliers using Higher-Degree Voronoi Diagrams</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new algorithms for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with outliers. Utilizing techniques from computational geometry, specifically higher-degree Voronoi diagrams, we navigate to the optimal subspace for PCA even in the presence of outliers. This approach achieves an optimal solution with a time complexity of $n^{d+\mathcal{O}(1)}\text{poly}(n,d)$. Additionally, we present a randomized algorithm with a complexity of $2^{\mathcal{O}(r(d-r))} \times \text{poly}(n, d)$. This algorithm samples subspaces characterized in terms of a Grassmannian manifold. By employing such sampling method, we ensure a high likelihood of capturing the optimal subspace, with the success probability $(1 - \delta)^T$. Where $\delta$ represents the probability that a sampled subspace does not contain the optimal solution, and $T$ is the number of subspaces sampled, proportional to $2^{r(d-r)}$. Our use of higher-degree Voronoi diagrams and Grassmannian based sampling offers a clearer conceptual pathway and practical advantages, particularly in handling large datasets or higher-dimensional settings.

<title>Temporal Source Recovery for Time-Series Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) data has grown in importance with the rise of Internet of Things devices like sensors, but its labeling remains costly and complex. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDAs) offers an effective solution, growing data privacy concerns have led to the development of Source-Free UDA (SFUDAs), enabling model adaptation to target domains without accessing source data. Despite their potential, applying existing SFUDAs to TS data is challenging due to the difficulty of transferring temporal dependencies, an essential characteristic of TS data, particularly in the absence of source samples. Although prior works attempt to address this by specific source pretraining designs, such requirements are often impractical, as source data owners cannot be expected to adhere to particular pretraining schemes. To address this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that leverages the intrinsic properties of TS data to generate a source-like domain and recover source temporal dependencies. With this domain, TemSR enables dependency transfer to the target domain without accessing source data or relying on source-specific designs, thereby facilitating effective and practical TS-SFUDA. TemSR features a masking recovery optimization process to generate a source-like distribution with restored temporal dependencies. This distribution is further refined through local context-aware regularization to preserve local dependencies, and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to promote distributional diversity. Together, these components enable effective temporal dependency recovery and facilitate transfer across domains using standard UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, which even surpasses existing TS-SFUDA methods that require source-specific designs.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides individuals who receive undesirable outcomes from machine learning systems with minimum-cost improvements to achieve a desirable outcome. However, machine learning models often get updated, so the recourse may not lead to the desired outcome. The robust recourse framework chooses recourses that are less sensitive to adversarial model changes, but this comes at a higher cost. To address this, we initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithmic recourse and evaluate the extent to which a designer equipped with a prediction of the future model can reduce the cost of recourse when the prediction is accurate (consistency) while also limiting the cost even when the prediction is inaccurate (robustness). We propose a novel algorithm, study the robustness-consistency trade-off, and analyze how prediction accuracy affects performance.

Abstract: Low-Dimension-to-High-Dimension (LDHD) generalization is a special case of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, where the training data are restricted to a low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional testing space. Assuming that each instance is generated from a latent variable and the dimension of the latent variable reflects the problem scale, the inherent scaling challenge in length generalization can be captured by the LDHD generalization in the latent space. We theoretically demonstrate that LDHD generalization is generally unattainable without exploiting prior knowledge to provide appropriate inductive bias. Specifically, we explore LDHD generalization in Boolean functions. We verify that different architectures trained with (S)GD converge to \emph{min-degree interpolators w.r.t. different independent sets}. LDHD generalization is achievable if and only if the target function coincides with this inductive bias. Applying the insights from LDHD generalization to length generalization, we explain the effectiveness of CoT as changing the structure latent space to enable better LDHD generalization. We also propose a principle for position embedding design to handle both the inherent LDHD generalization and the nuisances such as the data format. Following the principle, we propose a novel position embedding called RPE-Square that remedies the RPE for dealing with the data format nuisance.

Abstract: The information exponent ([BAGJ21]) and its extensions -- which are equivalent to the lowest
  degree in the Hermite expansion of the link function (after a potential label transform) for Gaussian single-index
  models -- have played an important role in predicting the sample complexity of online stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) in various learning tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that, for multi-index models, focusing solely on the
  lowest degree can miss key structural details of the model and result in suboptimal rates.
  Specifically, we consider the task of learning target functions of form $f_*(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{P} \phi(\mathbf{v}_k^* \cdot \mathbf{x})$,
  where $P \ll d$, the ground-truth directions $\{ \mathbf{v}_k^* \}_{k=1}^P$ are orthonormal, and the information exponent of
  $\phi$ is $L$. Based on the theory of information exponent, when $L = 2$, only the relevant subspace (not the exact
  directions) can be recovered due to the rotational invariance of the second-order terms, and when $L > 2$,
  recovering the directions using online SGD require $\tilde{O}(P d^{L-1})$ samples. In this work, we show that by
  considering both second- and higher-order terms, we can first learn the relevant space using the second-order
  terms, and then the exact directions using the higher-order terms, and the overall sample and complexity of online
  SGD is $\tilde{O}( d P^{L-1} )$.

<title>Comparative Performance of Collaborative Bandit Algorithms: Effect of Sparsity and Exploration Intensity</title>

Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of collaborative bandit algorithms and provides a thorough comparison of their performance. Collaborative bandits aim to improve the performance of contextual bandits by introducing relationships between arms (or items), allowing effective propagation of information. Collaboration among arms allows the feedback obtained through a single user (item) to be shared across related users (items). Introducing collaboration also alleviates the cold user (item) problem, i.e., lack of historical information when a new user (item) arriving to the platform with no prior record of interactions. In the context of modeling the relationships between arms (items), there are two main approaches: Hard and soft clustering. We call approaches that model the relationship between arms in an \textit{absolute} manner as hard clustering, i.e., the relationship is binary. Soft clustering relaxes membership constraints, allowing \textit{fuzzy} assignment. Focusing on the latter, we provide extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms and investigate the effect of sparsity and how the exploration intensity acts as a correction mechanism. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that controlling for sparsity in collaboration improves data efficiency and performance as it better informs learning. Meanwhile, increasing the exploration intensity acts as a correction because it effectively reduces variance due to potentially misspecified relationships among users. We observe that this misspecification is further remedied by introducing latent factors, and thus, increasing the dimensionality of the bandit parameters.

Abstract: Neural collapse (NC) and its multi-layer variant, deep neural collapse (DNC), describe a structured geometry that occurs in the features and weights of trained deep networks. Recent theoretical work by Sukenik et al. using a deep unconstrained feature model (UFM) suggests that DNC is suboptimal under mean squared error (MSE) loss. They heuristically argue that this is due to low-rank bias induced by L2 regularization. In this work, we extend this result to deep UFMs trained with cross-entropy loss, showing that high-rank structures, including DNC, are not generally optimal. We characterize the associated low-rank bias, proving a fixed bound on the number of non-negligible singular values at global minima as network depth increases. We further analyze the loss surface, demonstrating that DNC is more prevalent in the landscape than other critical configurations, which we argue explains its frequent empirical appearance. Our results are validated through experiments in deep UFMs and deep neural networks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce JDCL - a new method for continual learning with generative rehearsal based on joint diffusion models. Neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting defined as abrupt loss in the model's performance when retrained with additional data coming from a different distribution. Generative-replay-based continual learning methods try to mitigate this issue by retraining a model with a combination of new and rehearsal data sampled from a generative model. In this work, we propose to extend this idea by combining a continually trained classifier with a diffusion-based generative model into a single - jointly optimized neural network. We show that such shared parametrization, combined with the knowledge distillation technique allows for stable adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, where it outperforms recent state-of-the-art generative replay techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to the semi-supervised continual learning setup, where it outperforms competing buffer-based replay techniques, and evaluate, in a self-supervised manner, the quality of trained representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate confident yet inaccurate responses, introducing significant risks for deployment in safety-critical domains. We present a novel, test-time approach to detecting model hallucination through systematic analysis of information flow across model layers. We target cases when LLMs process inputs with ambiguous or insufficient context. Our investigation reveals that hallucination manifests as usable information deficiencies in inter-layer transmissions. While existing approaches primarily focus on final-layer output analysis, we demonstrate that tracking cross-layer information dynamics ($\mathcal{L}$I) provides robust indicators of model reliability, accounting for both information gain and loss during computation. $\mathcal{L}$I integrates easily with pretrained LLMs without requiring additional training or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Model merging offers an efficient alternative to multi-task learning by combining independently fine-tuned models, but most prior approaches focus mainly on avoiding task interference. We argue instead that the real potential of merging lies in achieving synergy, where tasks enhance one another. Our intuition comes from a pilot study showing that when a classifier trained on one task is paired with the encoder of another, the resulting cross-task performance strongly predicts merge quality. Moreover, adapting even a single task-specific layer can substantially improve this compatibility, suggesting a simple yet powerful lever for synergy. Building on this insight, we introduce SyMerge, a lightweight framework that jointly optimizes one task-specific layer and merging coefficients. To ensure stability without labels, SyMerge employs a robust self-labeling strategy guided by expert model predictions, avoiding the pitfalls of entropy-based adaptation. This minimalist yet principled design achieves state-of-the-art results across vision, dense prediction, and NLP benchmarks, while also producing adapted layers that transfer effectively to other merging methods.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering remains a fundamental challenge in data mining, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets where traditional approaches fail to scale effectively. Recent Chameleon-based algorithms - Chameleon2, M-Chameleon, and INNGS-Chameleon have proposed advanced strategies but they still suffer from $O(n^2)$ computational complexity, especially for large datasets. With Chameleon2 as the base algorithm, we introduce Chameleon2++ that addresses this challenge.
  Our algorithm has three parts. First, Graph Generation - we propose an approximate $k$-NN search instead of an exact one, specifically we integrate with the Annoy algorithm. This results in fast approximate nearest neighbor computation, significantly reducing the graph generation time. Second, Graph Partitioning - we propose use of a multi-level partitioning algorithm instead of a recursive bisection one. Specifically we adapt the hMETIS algorithm instead of the FM. This is because multi-level algorithms are robust to approximation introduced in the graph generation phase yielding higher-quality partitions, and that too with minimum configuration requirements. Third, Merging - we retain the flood fill heuristic that ensures connected balanced components in the partitions as well as efficient partition merging criteria leading to the final clusters.
  These enhancements reduce the overall time complexity to $O(n\log n)$, achieving scalability. On real-world benchmark datasets used in prior Chameleon works, Chameleon2++ delivers an average of 4% improvement in clustering quality. This demonstrates that algorithmic efficiency and clustering quality can co-exist in large-scale hierarchical clustering.

<title>Cooperative Decentralized Backdoor Attacks on Vertical Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries alter model behavior on target classification labels by embedding triggers into data samples. While these attacks have received considerable attention in horizontal FL, they are less understood for vertical FL (VFL), where devices hold different features of the samples, and only the server holds the labels. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on VFL which (i) does not rely on gradient information from the server and (ii) considers potential collusion among multiple adversaries for sample selection and trigger embedding. Our label inference model augments variational autoencoders with metric learning, which adversaries can train locally. A consensus process over the adversary graph topology determines which datapoints to poison. We further propose methods for trigger splitting across the adversaries, with an intensity-based implantation scheme skewing the server towards the trigger. Our convergence analysis reveals the impact of backdoor perturbations on VFL indicated by a stationarity gap for the trained model, which we verify empirically as well. We conduct experiments comparing our attack with recent backdoor VFL approaches, finding that ours obtains significantly higher success rates for the same main task performance despite not using server information. Additionally, our results verify the impact of collusion on attack performance.

Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in their reasoning capabilities, hold transformative potential for addressing complex challenges and boosting scientific discovery in atmospheric science. However, leveraging LLMs effectively in this domain requires a robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Toward this end, we present AtmosSci-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess LLM performance across five core categories of atmospheric science problems: hydrology, atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and physical oceanography. AtmosSci-Bench features a dual-format design comprising both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and open-ended questions (OEQs), enabling scalable automated evaluation alongside deeper analysis of conceptual understanding. We employ a template-based MCQ generation framework to create diverse, graduate-level problems with symbolic perturbation, while OEQs are used to probe open-ended reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs, categorized into four groups: instruction-tuned models, advanced reasoning models, math-augmented models, and domain-specific climate models. Our analysis provides some interesting insights into the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in atmospheric science. We believe AtmosSci-Bench can serve as a critical step toward advancing LLM applications in climate services by offering a standard and rigorous evaluation framework.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms have shown promising results in robotic manipulation tasks, but their vulnerability to offline universal perturbation attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on both classic and recently proposed algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC), LSTM-GMM, Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), Diffusion Policy (DP), and Vector-Quantizied Behavior Transformer (VQ-BET). We study the vulnerability of these methods to universal adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on several simulated robotic manipulation tasks reveal that most of the current methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We also show that these attacks are often transferable across algorithms, architectures, and tasks, raising concerning security vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a systematic study of the vulnerabilities of different LfD algorithms to both white-box and black-box attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of modern BC algorithms, paving the way for future work in addressing such limitations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the poor finite-horizon performance of existing online \emph{restless bandit} (RB) algorithms, which stems from the prohibitive sample complexity of learning a full \emph{Markov decision process} (MDP) for each agent. We argue that superior finite-horizon performance requires \emph{rapid convergence} to a \emph{high-quality} policy. Thus motivated, we introduce a reformulation of online RBs as a \emph{budgeted thresholding contextual bandit}, which simplifies the learning problem by encoding long-term state transitions into a scalar reward. We prove the first non-asymptotic optimality of an oracle policy for a simplified finite-horizon setting. We propose a practical learning policy under a heterogeneous-agent, multi-state setting, and show that it achieves a sublinear regret, achieving \emph{faster convergence} than existing methods. This directly translates to higher cumulative reward, as empirically validated by significant gains over state-of-the-art algorithms in large-scale heterogeneous environments. Our work provides a new pathway for achieving practical, sample-efficient learning in finite-horizon RBs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing various applications, including content generation, search and recommendation, and AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However, despite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory inefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to offload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving efficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or high model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs.
  To tame the latency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present FineMoE, a fine-grained expert offloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with memory efficiency. We design FineMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection patterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently guide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. FineMoE is prototyped on top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed. Experiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that FineMoE reduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 39% over state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Operator learning for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) has seen rapid progress in recent years, enabling efficient approximation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics. However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. Here, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 60-80 % and speed-ups of 30-40 % at inference time. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zwu88/TANTE for transparency and reproducibility.

<title>Fed-SB: A Silver Bullet for Extreme Communication Efficiency and Performance in (Private) Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become ubiquitous for efficiently fine-tuning foundation models. However, federated fine-tuning using LoRA is challenging due to suboptimal updates arising from traditional federated averaging of individual adapters. Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high communication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer from performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce Federated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB), a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of LLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB optimally aligns the optimization trajectory with the ideal low-rank full fine-tuning projection by learning a small square matrix (R) between adapters B and A, keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact updates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent of the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves state-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by up to 230x. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1) reducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for differential privacy and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other methods. Overall, Fed-SB offers a state-of-the-art, efficient, and scalable solution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/fed-sb.

Abstract: Inference scaling methods for LLMs often rely on decomposing problems into steps (or groups of tokens), followed by sampling and selecting the best next steps. However, these steps and their sizes are often predetermined or manually designed based on domain knowledge. We propose dynamic decomposition, a method that adaptively and automatically partitions solution and reasoning traces into manageable steps during inference. By more effectively allocating compute -- particularly through subdividing challenging steps and prioritizing their sampling -- dynamic decomposition significantly improves inference efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks such as APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that dynamic decomposition outperforms static approaches, including token-level, sentence-level, and single-step decompositions, reducing the pass@10 error rate by 5.0%, 6.7%, and 10.5% respectively. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic decomposition to improve a wide range of inference scaling techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have remarkably succeeded in various image processing tasks. However, their large size and computational complexity present significant challenges for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an innovative approach for integrating Mamba Architecture within a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) process to address the challenge of reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy in image classification tasks. The proposed framework distills a large teacher model into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks. Each student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within the Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing computational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For MNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models as a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's performance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's FLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students achieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student retaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy. These results confirm the flexibility and scalability of Mamba Architecture, which can be integrated into PKD, succeeding in the process of finding students as weak learners. The framework provides a solution for deploying complex neural networks in real-time applications with a reduction in computational cost.

Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.

<title>Dependency-aware Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Active learning aims to efficiently build a labeled training set by strategically selecting samples to query labels from annotators. In this sequential process, each sample acquisition influences subsequent selections, causing dependencies among samples in the labeled set. However, these dependencies are overlooked during the model parameter estimation stage when updating the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a conventional method that assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. We propose Dependency-aware MLE (DMLE), which corrects MLE within the active learning framework by addressing sample dependencies typically neglected due to the i.i.d. assumption, ensuring consistency with active learning principles in the model parameter estimation process. This improved method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, reaching higher performance in earlier cycles compared to conventional MLE. Specifically, we observe average accuracy improvements of 6%, 8.6%, and 10.5% for k=1, k=5, and k=10 respectively, after collecting the first 100 samples, where entropy is the acquisition function and k is the query batch size acquired at every active learning cycle. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/neu-spiral/DMLEforAL

Abstract: This work tackles the fundamental challenges in Federated Learning (FL) posed by arbitrary client participation and data heterogeneity, prevalent characteristics in practical FL settings. It is well-established that popular FedAvg-style algorithms struggle with exact convergence and can suffer from slow convergence rates since a decaying learning rate is required to mitigate these scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of stochastic matrix and the corresponding time-varying graphs as a novel modeling tool to accurately capture the dynamics of arbitrary client participation and the local update procedure. Leveraging this approach, we offer a fresh decentralized perspective on designing FL algorithms and present FOCUS, Federated Optimization with Exact Convergence via Push-pull Strategy, a provably convergent algorithm designed to effectively overcome the previously mentioned two challenges. More specifically, we provide a rigorous proof demonstrating that FOCUS achieves exact convergence with a linear rate regardless of the arbitrary client participation, establishing it as the first work to demonstrate this significant result.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Transformers struggle with length generalisation, displaying poor performance even on basic tasks. We test whether these limitations can be explained through two key failures of the self-attention mechanism. The first is the inability to fully remove irrelevant information. The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve the generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) reflects the brain's functional state, making it a crucial tool for diverse detection applications like seizure detection and sleep stage classification. While deep learning-based approaches have recently shown promise for automated detection, traditional models are often constrained by limited learnable parameters and only achieve modest performance. In contrast, large foundation models showed improved capabilities by scaling up the model size, but required extensive time-consuming pre-training. Moreover, both types of existing methods require complex and redundant post-processing pipelines to convert discrete labels to continuous annotations. In this work, based on the multi-scale nature of EEG events, we propose a simple U-shaped model to efficiently learn representations by capturing both local and global features using convolution and self-attentive modules for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Compared to other window-level classification models, our method directly outputs predictions at the time-step level, eliminating redundant overlapping inferences. Beyond sequence-to-sequence modeling, the architecture naturally extends to window-level classification by incorporating an attention-pooling layer. Such a paradigm shift and model design demonstrated promising efficiency improvement, cross-subject generalization, and state-of-the-art performance in various time-step and window-level classification tasks in the experiment. More impressively, our model showed the capability to be scaled up to the same level as existing large foundation models that have been extensively pre-trained over diverse datasets and outperforms them by solely using the downstream fine-tuning dataset. Our model won 1st place in the 2025 "seizure detection challenge" organized in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders.

Abstract: Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from pre-collected datasets, offering a practical solution for applications where online interactions are risky or costly. Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks. Overall, VIPO offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy.

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment.
  In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

Abstract: We propose Derivative Learning (DERL), a supervised approach that models physical systems by learning their partial derivatives. We also leverage DERL to build physical models incrementally, by designing a distillation protocol that effectively transfers knowledge from a pre-trained model to a student one. We provide theoretical guarantees that DERL can learn the true physical system, being consistent with the underlying physical laws, even when using empirical derivatives. DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizing an ODE to unseen initial conditions and a parametric PDE to unseen parameters. We also design a method based on DERL to transfer physical knowledge across models by extending them to new portions of the physical domain and a new range of PDE parameters. We believe this is the first attempt at building physical models incrementally in multiple stages.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, but suffers from distribution shift, causing inaccurate evaluation and overestimation of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods counter this by conservatively discouraging all OOD actions, which limits generalization. We propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), which evaluates OOD actions via an advantage-like function and uses it to modulate the Q-function update discriminatively. Our key insight is that the (state) value function is generally learned more reliably than the action-value function; we thus use the next-state value to indirectly assess each action. We develop a PointMaze environment to clearly visualize that advantage modulation effectively selects superior OOD actions while discouraging inferior ones. Moreover, extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, with especially strong gains on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty parameter to limit the changepoints count. Determining the optimal value for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses recurrent networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark genomic datasets show that this novel method generally outperforms traditional ones in changepoint detection accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing approaches either impose strong distributional assumptions or face challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from $O(N\log N)$ to $O(N)$ by aggregating gradients into fixed-size bins. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy - designed to distribute data points evenly among bins -- may overlook critical boundary values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we consider a novel approach that replaces quantile binning with a $k$-means discretizer initialized with quantile bins, and justify the swap with a proof showing how, for any $L$-Lipschitz function, k-means maximizes the worst-case explained variance of Y obtained when treating all values in a given bin as equivalent. We test this swap against quantile and uniform binning on 33 OpenML datasets plus synthetics that control for modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in three cases-most strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15 classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs 0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large MSE gains - typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exhaustive (no-binning) splitting when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the 32-64-bin GPU regime - because it is a "safe default" with large upside, yet adds only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 3.5s per feature to bin 10M rows on one Apple M1 thread).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially acceptable responses. However, this behavior is known to be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data, can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable directions in weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this perspective. We examine whether safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific linear subspaces, whether it can be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from distinguishable patterns in activations. Across both weight and activation spaces, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe behaviors also amplify useful ones, and prompts with different safety implications activate overlapping representations. Rather than residing in distinct directions, we show that safety is highly entangled with the general learning components of the model. This suggests that subspace-based defenses face fundamental limitations and underscores the need for alternative strategies to preserve safety under continued training. We corroborate these findings with multiple experiments on five open-source LLMs from the Llama and Qwen families. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/safety-subspaces.

<title>Directional Convergence, Benign Overfitting of Gradient Descent in leaky ReLU two-layer Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers trained on mixture data via gradient descent. We provide both, upper and lower classification error bounds, and discover a phase transition in the bound as a function of signal strength. The lower bound leads to a characterization of cases when benign overfitting provably fails even if directional convergence occurs. Our analysis allows us to considerably relax the distributional assumptions that are made in existing work on benign overfitting of leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers. We can allow for non-sub-Gaussian data and do not require near orthogonality. Our results are derived by establishing directional convergence of the network parameters and studying classification error bounds for the convergent direction. Previously, directional convergence in (leaky) ReLU neural networks was established only for gradient flow. By first establishing directional convergence, we are able to study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers in a much wider range of scenarios than was done before.

<title>AdaSTaR: Adaptive Data Sampling for Training Self-Taught Reasoners</title>

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

<title>Computing Exact Shapley Values in Polynomial Time for Product-Kernel Methods</title>

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility and expressiveness. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP and kernel method-specific adaptation like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values is generally intractable, leading existing methods to rely on approximations and thereby incur unavoidable error. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. The core of our approach is a new value function, the functional baseline value function, specifically designed for product-kernel models. This value function removes the influence of a feature subset by setting its functional component to the least informative state. Crucially, it allows a recursive thus efficient computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. As an important additional contribution, we show that our framework extends beyond predictive modeling to statistical inference. In particular, it generalizes to popular kernel-based discrepancy measures such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thereby providing new tools for interpretable statistical inference.

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in. This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate- and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call ``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++ demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future advancements in LBMs.

<title>COUNTDOWN: Contextually Sparse Activation Filtering Out Unnecessary Weights in Down Projection</title>

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.

<title>How Many Parameters Does Your Task Really Need? Task Specific Pruning with LLM-Sieve</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for narrow tasks in resource-constrained settings, a central question arises: how much of an LLM is truly necessary for a given task? We present LLM-Sieve, a framework that prunes LLMs down to the minimal parameter subset needed to preserve task performance. Our approach introduces two innovations: (i) output-aligned non-orthogonal projections, which yield more faithful low-rank approximations than traditional PCA/SVD by aligning directly with layer outputs; and (ii) adaptive pruning via a Genetic Algorithm, which automatically discovers matrix-specific pruning levels and exposes the uneven distribution of task-relevant knowledge. Across models from 3.8B to 70B parameters, LLM-Sieve removes 20-75% of weights with only 1-5% accuracy loss-substantially ahead of prior pruning methods. Beyond efficiency, our framework reveals bottleneck matrices that concentrate critical knowledge, suggesting architectural implications for future LLM design. LLM-Sieve integrates seamlessly with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization, enabling both efficient deployment and deeper understanding of knowledge organization in LLMs.

<title>How to build a consistency model: Learning flow maps via self-distillation</title>

Abstract: Flow-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sample quality, but require the expensive solution of a differential equation at inference time. Flow map models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass many recent efforts to improve inference-time efficiency by learning the solution operator of this differential equation. Yet despite their promise, these models lack a unified description that clearly explains how to learn them efficiently in practice. Here, building on the methodology proposed in Boffi et. al. (2024), we present a systematic algorithmic framework for directly learning the flow map associated with a flow or diffusion model. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert any distillation scheme into a direct training algorithm via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained teachers. We introduce three algorithmic families based on different mathematical characterizations of the flow map: Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Progressive methods, which we show encompass and extend all known distillation and direct training schemes for consistency models. We find that the novel class of Lagrangian methods, which avoid both spatial derivatives and bootstrapping from small steps by design, achieve significantly more stable training and higher performance than more standard Eulerian and Progressive schemes. Our methodology unifies existing training schemes under a single common framework and reveals new design principles for accelerated generative modeling. Associated code is available at https://github.com/nmboffi/flow-maps.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful post-training technique to incentivize the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs can respond very inconsistently to RL finetuning: some show substantial performance gains, while others plateau or even degrade. To understand this divergence, we analyze the per-step influence of the RL objective and identify two key conditions for effective post-training: (1) RL-informative rollout accuracy, and (2) strong data co-influence, which quantifies how much the training data affects performance on other samples. Guided by these insights, we propose behavior injection, a task-agnostic data augmentation scheme applied prior to RL. Behavior injection enriches the supervised finetuning (SFT) data by seeding exploratory and exploitative behaviors, effectively making the model more RL-ready. We evaluate our method across two reasoning benchmarks with multiple base models. The results demonstrate that our theoretically motivated augmentation can significantly increase the performance gain from RL over the pre-RL model.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical domains but suffers from sample inefficiency, training instability, and limited interpretability. Data attribution provides a principled way to trace model behavior back to training samples, yet existing methods assume fixed datasets, which is violated in online RL where each experience both updates the policy and shapes future data collection. In this paper, we initiate the study of data attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a \emph{local} attribution framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications: diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and achieves higher returns. Together, these results open a new direction for making online RL more interpretable, efficient, and effective.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms, changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects, thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) offer a computationally scalable framework for generative modeling, supporting exact and efficient inference of a wide range of probabilistic queries. While recent advances have significantly improved the expressiveness and scalability of PCs, effectively training their parameters remains a challenge. In particular, a widely used optimization method, full-batch Expectation-Maximization (EM), requires processing the entire dataset before performing a single update, making it ineffective for large datasets. Although empirical extensions to the mini-batch setting, as well as gradient-based mini-batch algorithms, converge faster than full-batch EM, they generally underperform in terms of final likelihood. We investigate this gap by establishing a novel theoretical connection between these practical algorithms and the general EM objective. Our analysis reveals a fundamental issue that existing mini-batch EM and gradient-based methods fail to properly regularize distribution changes, causing each update to effectively ``overfit'' the current mini-batch. Motivated by this insight, we introduce anemone, a new mini-batch EM algorithm for PCs. Anemone applies an implicit adaptive learning rate to each parameter, scaled by how much it contributes to the likelihood of the current batch. Across extensive experiments on language, image, and DNA datasets, anemone consistently outperforms existing optimizers in both convergence speed and final performance.

Abstract: Neural networks trained on real-world data often exhibit biases while simultaneously being vulnerable to privacy attacks aimed at extracting sensitive information. Despite extensive research on each problem individually, their intersection remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the privacy impact of spurious correlation bias. We introduce \emph{spurious privacy leakage}, a phenomenon in which spurious groups are significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks than non-spurious groups. We observe that privacy disparity between groups increases in tasks with simpler objectives (e.g. fewer classes) due to spurious features. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that spurious robust methods, designed to reduce spurious bias, fail to mitigate privacy disparity. Our analysis reveals that this occurs because robust methods can reduce reliance on spurious features for prediction, but do not prevent their memorization during training. Finally, we systematically compare the privacy of different model architectures trained with spurious data, demonstrating that, contrary to previous work, architectural choice can affect privacy evaluation.

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach, while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models. Project page at https://diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io/.

Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation, adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses - perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Memory prefetching has long boosted CPU caches and is increasingly vital for far-memory systems, where large portions of memory are offloaded to cheaper, remote tiers. While effective prefetching requires accurate prediction of future accesses, prior ML approaches have been limited to simulation or small-scale hardware. We introduce FarSight, the first Linux-based far-memory system to leverage deep learning by decoupling application semantics from runtime memory layout. This separation enables offline-trained models to predict access patterns over a compact ordinal vocabulary, which are resolved at runtime through lightweight mappings. Across four data-intensive workloads, FarSight delivers up to 3.6x higher performance than the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: We study the problem active sequential hypothesis testing, also known as pure exploration: given a new task, the learner adaptively collects data from the environment to efficiently determine an underlying correct hypothesis. A classical instance of this problem is the task of identifying the best arm in a multi-armed bandit problem (a.k.a. BAI, Best-Arm Identification), where actions index hypotheses. Another important case is generalized search, a problem of determining the correct label through a sequence of strategically selected queries that indirectly reveal information about the label. In this work, we introduce In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), which meta-trains Transformers to map observation histories to query actions and a predicted hypothesis, yielding a model that transfers in-context. At inference time, ICPE actively gathers evidence on new tasks and infers the true hypothesis without parameter updates. Across deterministic, stochastic, and structured benchmarks, including BAI and generalized search, ICPE is competitive with adaptive baselines while requiring no explicit modeling of information structure. Our results support Transformers as practical architectures for general sequential testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation. However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models, achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes machine learning pipelines.

<title>Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models</title>

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and measurement, and often failed to maximizing the consistency to the measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown noise. To address these issues, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that flexibly balances prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing approaches such as DDNM, TMPD, while generalizing to handle both known Gaussian noise and unknown or non-Gaussian noise types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a variety of tasks, while maintaining relatively low computational cost.

Abstract: Here we present a series of artificial models - a total of four related models - based on machine learning techniques that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar curatorship work. Out of our four artificial intelligence models, three achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions with an accuracy well above random choices; and second, that using feature engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can make them almost as good as those using the so-called large language models such as GPT in a brute force approach.

<title>Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the first study of grokking in practical LLM pretraining. Specifically, we investigate when an LLM memorizes the training data, when its generalization on downstream tasks starts to improve, and what happens if there is a lag between the two. Unlike existing works studying when a small model generalizes to limited and specified tasks during thousands epochs' training on algorithmic data, we focus on a practical setting for LLMs, i.e., one-epoch pretraining of next-token prediction on a cross-domain, large-scale corpus, and generalization on diverse benchmark tasks covering math/commonsense reasoning, code generation, and domain-specific retrieval. Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still emerges in pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, though different local data groups may enter their grokking stages asynchronously due to the heterogeneity of their distributions and attributions to others. To find a mechanistic interpretation of this local grokking, we investigate the dynamics of training data's pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers in MoE). Our primary discovery is that the pathways evolve from random, non-smooth across layers, instance-specific to more structured and transferable across samples, despite the converged pretraining loss. This depicts a transition from memorization to generalization. Two novel metrics are developed to quantify these patterns: one computes the pathway similarity between samples, while the other measures the consistency of aggregated experts between subsequent layers for each sample. These training data based metrics induce zero cost but can faithfully track and monitor the generalization of LLMs on downstream tasks, which, in conventional settings, requires costly instruction tuning and benchmark evaluation.

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts, hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems. The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for improving compound systems.

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs and overestimating robustness. We show that for the goal of eliciting harmful responses, repeated sampling of model outputs during the attack complements prompt optimization and serves as a strong and efficient attack vector. By casting attacks as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal trade-offs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts success rates by up to 37\% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. We further analyze how distributions of output harmfulness evolve during an adversarial attack, discovering that many common optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a label-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy maximization, demonstrating how our sampling-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings establish the importance of sampling in attacks to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety at scale.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, matching their performance through large-scale training. However, inference-time control remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we study how to steer generation toward desired rewards without retraining the models. Prior methods typically resample or filter within a single denoising trajectory, optimizing rewards step-by-step without trajectory-level refinement. We introduce particle Gibbs sampling for diffusion language models (PG-DLM), a novel inference-time algorithm enabling trajectory-level refinement while preserving generation perplexity under reward optimization. PG-DLM constructs a Markov chain over full denoising trajectories and applies a conditional sequential Monte Carlo kernel to resample them. We derive theoretical guarantees for convergence, including asymptotic consistency and variance bounds. Within this framework, we further analyze trade-offs across four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed budgets: iterations, samples, denoising steps, and reward estimation. Our analysis shows scaling iterations achieves the best reward-perplexity trade-off. Empirically, PG-DLM consistently outperforms prior methods using MDLM and LLaDA-8B as base models across a wide range of compute budgets for reward-guided generation tasks including toxicity and sentiment control as well as linguistic acceptability.

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains such as biology, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in the availability of scalable advising systems capable of providing high-quality, well-reasoned feedback to refine proposed hypotheses and experimental designs. To address this challenge, we explore key factors that underlie the development of robust advising systems, including model size, context length, confidence estimation, and structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose language models such as Deepseek-R1 in terms of acceptance rates for self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding 90% on the ICLR 2025 test set, underscoring its potential to significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation and experimental design.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense framework that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security. However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from historical trends. We attribute this to the lack of rich, physically grounded datasets directly linking atmospheric states to yields. To address this, we introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that learns representations from large satellite-based weather datasets and transfers to the ground-based limited measurements available for yield prediction. VITA is trained using detailed meteorological variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict latent atmospheric states under a seasonality-aware sinusoidal prior. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using limited weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios, particularly during extreme years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p < 0.0001$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN without soil data, and bigger foundational models (e.g., Chronos-Bolt) with less compute, making it practical for real-world use--especially in data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data. Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

<title>Attention as an Adaptive Filter</title>

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary dot-product attention.

<title>time2time: Causal Intervention in Hidden States to Simulate Rare Events in Time Series Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period) during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts: injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks. Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically grounded representations are a robust property of large time series transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a \emph{Physics-informed (Pi)} regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Eikonal-regularized HIQL (Eik-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion ('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals: (a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would otherwise go un-noticed.

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

<title>Analyzing Uncertainty Quantification in Statistical and Deep Learning Models for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

<title>Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

<title>When Judgment Becomes Noise: How Design Failures in LLM Judge Benchmarks Silently Undermine Validity</title>

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We released our code and dataset at https://github.com/penfever/judgment-to-noise

<title>CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

<title>RL Grokking Recipe: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Algorithms in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code -- Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding -- a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? -- and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<title>Active Attacks: Red-teaming LLMs via Adaptive Environments</title>

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT) improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions. The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the growth of logits further validate our theory.

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate. Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms: (i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases (VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

<title>Layer-wise dynamic rank for compressing large language models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank, a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40% compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

<title>Autonomy-Aware Clustering: When Local Decisions Supersede Global Prescriptions</title>

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a Deterministic Annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

<title>Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning</title>

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output (VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view, we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings, whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and machine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity and high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full covariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts have been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts, reducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local covariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts substantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we construct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo samplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process expert parameters. This greatly improves inference compared to importance sampling, particularly in settings when a stationary Gaussian process is inappropriate, while still being thoroughly parallelizable.

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are characterized by an unobservable Markov chain and an observable process -- a noisy version of the hidden chain. Decoding the original signal from the noisy observations is one of the main goals in nearly all HMM based data analyses. Existing decoding algorithms such as Viterbi and the pointwise maximum a posteriori (PMAP) algorithm have computational complexity at best linear in the length of the observed sequence, and sub-quadratic in the size of the state space of the hidden chain.
  We present Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation (QATS), a divide-and-conquer procedure with computational complexity polylogarithmic in the length of the sequence, and cubic in the size of the state space, hence particularly suited for large scale HMMs with relatively few states. It also suggests an effective way of data storage as specific cumulative sums. In essence, the estimated sequence of states sequentially maximizes local likelihood scores among all local paths with at most three segments, and is meanwhile admissible. The maximization is performed only approximately using an adaptive search procedure. Our simulations demonstrate the speedups offered by QATS in comparison to Viterbi and PMAP, along with a precision analysis. An implementation of QATS is in the R-package QATS on GitHub.

Abstract: We develop a fitted value iteration (FVI) method to compute bicausal optimal transport (OT) where couplings have an adapted structure. Based on the dynamic programming formulation, FVI adopts a function class to approximate the value functions in bicausal OT. Under the concentrability condition and approximate completeness assumption, we prove the sample complexity using (local) Rademacher complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multilayer neural networks with appropriate structures satisfy the crucial assumptions required in sample complexity proofs. Numerical experiments reveal that FVI outperforms linear programming and adapted Sinkhorn methods in scalability as the time horizon increases, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Abstract: The potential of Large Language Model (LLM) as agents has been widely acknowledged recently. Thus, there is an urgent need to quantitatively \textit{evaluate LLMs as agents} on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional benchmark that consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities. Our extensive test over \num API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and many OSS competitors that are no larger than 70B. We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents. Improving instruction following and training on high quality multi-round alignment data could improve agent performance. And different from existing assumptions, training on code present ambivalent impacts on different agent tasks. Datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench.

arXiv:2312.07784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to test practical privacy of machine learning models. MIAs complement formal guarantees from differential privacy (DP) under a more realistic adversary model. We analyse MIA vulnerability of fine-tuned neural networks both empirically and theoretically, the latter using a simplified model of fine-tuning. We show that the vulnerability of non-DP models when measured as the attacker advantage at a fixed false positive rate reduces according to a simple power law as the number of examples per class increases. A similar power-law applies even for the most vulnerable points, but the dataset size needed for adequate protection of the most vulnerable points is very large.

These datasets provide a realistic testing ground for key information extraction tasks like investment analysis and contract analysis. In addition to presenting these datasets, we offer an in-depth description of the annotation process, document processing techniques, and baseline modeling approaches. This contribution facilitates the development of NLP models capable of handling practical challenges and supports further research into information extraction technologies applicable to industry-specific problems.

Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to analyze the performance of continuous optimization algorithms using generalization guarantees from statistical learning theory. We study classical and learned optimizers to solve families of parametric optimization problems. We build generalization guarantees for classical optimizers, using a sample convergence bound, and for learned optimizers, using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework. To train learned optimizers, we use a gradient-based algorithm to directly minimize the PAC-Bayes upper bound. Numerical experiments in signal processing, control, and meta-learning showcase the ability of our framework to provide strong generalization guarantees for both classical and learned optimizers given a fixed budget of iterations. For classical optimizers, our bounds are much tighter than those that worst-case guarantees provide. For learned optimizers, our bounds outperform the empirical outcomes observed in their non-learned counterparts.

<title>Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions</title>

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.
  We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.
  We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\alpha \in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\alpha$. Our algorithm achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.

Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach extends the Information Bottleneck principle to heterogeneous data through generalised product kernels, integrating continuous, nominal, and ordinal variables within a unified optimization framework. We address the following challenges: developing a systematic bandwidth selection strategy that equalises contributions across variable types, and proposing an adaptive hyperparameter updating scheme that ensures a valid solution into a predetermined number of potentially imbalanced clusters. Through simulations on 28,800 synthetic data sets and ten publicly available benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method, named DIBmix, achieves superior performance compared to four established methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, FAMD with K-Means, and PAM with Gower's dissimilarity). Results show DIBmix particularly excels when clusters exhibit size imbalances, data contain low or moderate cluster overlap, and categorical and continuous variables are equally represented. The method presents a significant advantage over traditional centroid-based algorithms, establishing DIBmix as a competitive and theoretically grounded alternative for mixed-type data clustering.

<title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early Stopping</title>

arXiv:2407.11353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization.

<title>ClinicRealm: Re-evaluating Large Language Models with Conventional Machine Learning for Non-Generative Clinical Prediction Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medicine. However, their utility in non-generative clinical prediction, often presumed inferior to specialized models, remains under-evaluated, leading to ongoing debate within the field and potential for misuse, misunderstanding, or over-reliance due to a lack of systematic benchmarking. Our ClinicRealm study addresses this by benchmarking 15 GPT-style LLMs, 5 BERT-style models, and 11 traditional methods on unstructured clinical notes and structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), while also assessing their reasoning, reliability, and fairness. Key findings reveal a significant shift: for clinical note predictions, leading LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.1-Think, GPT-5) in zero-shot settings now decisively outperform finetuned BERT models. On structured EHRs, while specialized models excel with ample data, advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3.1-Think) show potent zero-shot capabilities, often surpassing conventional models in data-scarce settings. Notably, leading open-source LLMs can match or exceed proprietary counterparts. These results provide compelling evidence that modern LLMs are competitive tools for non-generative clinical prediction, particularly with unstructured text and offering data-efficient structured data options, thus necessitating a re-evaluation of model selection strategies. This research should serve as an important insight for medical informaticists, AI developers, and clinical researchers, potentially prompting a reassessment of current assumptions and inspiring new approaches to LLM application in predictive healthcare.

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus thus far has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In the proportional regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibits behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and test errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for (i) a random teacher model, (ii) a deterministic teacher model where the weights are perfectly aligned with the covariance of the data. Under the random teacher model setting, we also verify that the generalized cross-validation (GCV) estimator can consistently estimate the generalization error in the quadratic regime for anisotropic data.

Abstract: Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.

Abstract: We study the approximation capacity of deep ReLU recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and explore the convergence properties of nonparametric least squares regression using RNNs. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of RNNs for H\"older smooth functions, in the sense that the output at each time step of an RNN can approximate a H\"older function that depends only on past and current information, termed a past-dependent function. This allows a carefully constructed RNN to simultaneously approximate a sequence of past-dependent H\"older functions. We apply these approximation results to derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the prediction error of the empirical risk minimizer in regression problem. Our error bounds achieve minimax optimal rate under both exponentially $\beta$-mixing and i.i.d. data assumptions, improving upon existing ones. Our results provide statistical guarantees on the performance of RNNs.

Abstract: We use the embedding formalism to construct conformal fields in $D$ dimensions, by restricting Lorentz-invariant ensembles of homogeneous neural networks in $(D+2)$ dimensions to the projective null cone. Conformal correlators may be computed using the parameter space description of the neural network. Exact four-point correlators are computed in a number of examples, and we perform a 4D conformal block decomposition that elucidates the spectrum. In some examples the analysis is facilitated by recent approaches to Feynman integrals. Generalized free CFTs are constructed using the infinite-width Gaussian process limit of the neural network, enabling a realization of the free boson. The extension to deep networks constructs conformal fields at each subsequent layer, with recursion relations relating their conformal dimensions and four-point functions. Numerical approaches are discussed.

Abstract: Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

Abstract: Our interest is in the design of software systems involving a human-expert interacting -- using natural language -- with a large language model (LLM) on data analysis tasks. For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects. The results provide evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way intelligibility in the design of human-machine systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/karannb/interact.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Extreme Multi-Label Text Classification models rely on multi-label attention to focus on key tokens in input text, but learning good attention weights is challenging. We introduce PLANT - Pretrained and Leveraged Attention - a plug-and-play strategy for initializing attention. PLANT works by planting label-specific attention using a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model guided by mutual information gain. This architecture-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with large language model backbones such as Mistral-7B, LLaMA3-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and Phi-3. PLANT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks including ICD coding, legal topic classification, and content recommendation. Gains are especially pronounced in few-shot settings, with substantial improvements on rare labels. Ablation studies confirm that attention initialization is a key driver of these gains.

arXiv:2411.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing tools for explaining complex models and systems are associational rather than causal and do not provide mechanistic understanding. We propose a new notion called counterfactual explainability for causal attribution that is motivated by the concept of genetic heritability in twin studies. Counterfactual explainability extends methods for global sensitivity analysis (including the functional analysis of variance and Sobol's indices), which assumes independent explanatory variables, to dependent explanations by using a directed acyclic graphs to describe their causal relationship. Therefore, this explanability measure directly incorporates causal mechanisms by construction. Under a comonotonicity assumption, we discuss methods for estimating counterfactual explainability and apply them to a real dataset dataset to explain income inequality by gender, race, and educational attainment.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.

<title>H3Fusion: Helpful, Harmless, Honest Fusion of Aligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: Alignment of pretrained LLMs using instruction-based datasets is critical for creating fine-tuned models that reflect human preference. A growing number of alignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling the efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful, harmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This paper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined as $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles multiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model with enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust alignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second, $H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We first freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while tuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model weights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and dynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the output response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting $H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The former penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter mediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts the fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the experts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that $H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\%$, and it provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by $13.77\%$.

Abstract: From structural biology to epidemiology, predictions from machine learning (ML) models increasingly complement costly gold-standard data to enable faster, more affordable, and scalable scientific inquiry. In response, prediction-based (PB) inference has emerged to accommodate statistical analysis using a large volume of predictions together with a small amount of gold-standard data. The goals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate bias from errors in predictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to classical inference using only the gold-standard data. While early PB inference methods focused on bias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains a focus of ongoing research. We revisit a foundational PB inference method and show that a simple modification can be applied to guarantee provable improvements in efficiency. In doing so, we establish new connections between augmented inverse probability weighted estimators (AIPW) and several recently proposed PB inference methods with a similar focus. The utility of our proposal, which leverages prediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency, is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to real data from the UK Biobank. Further, we contextualize PB inference by drawing connections to historical literature from economics and statistics, highlighting how classic methods directly inform this contemporary problem.

Abstract: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining enormous popularity in recent years. However, the training of LLMs has raised significant privacy and legal concerns, particularly regarding the distillation and inclusion of copyrighted materials in their training data without proper attribution or licensing, an issue that falls under the broader concern of data misappropriation. In this article, we focus on a specific problem of data misappropriation detection, namely, to determine whether a given LLM has incorporated the data generated by another LLM. We propose embedding watermarks into the copyrighted training data and formulating the detection of data misappropriation as a hypothesis testing problem. We develop a general statistical testing framework, construct test statistics, determine optimal rejection thresholds, and explicitly control type I and type II errors. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed tests, and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness through intensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Autoregressive construction approaches generate solutions to vehicle routing problems in a step-by-step fashion, leading to high-quality solutions that are nearing the performance achieved by handcrafted operations research techniques. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigm of sequential solution construction and introduce an iterative search framework where solutions are instead deconstructed by a neural policy. Throughout the search, the neural policy collaborates with a simple greedy insertion algorithm to rebuild the deconstructed solutions. Our approach matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art operations research methods across three challenging vehicle routing problems of various problem sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables the model to perform new tasks conditioning only on the examples provided in the context without updating the model's weights. While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task.

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT, AI agents, and video generation, contemporary mobile systems have begun integrating these AI capabilities on local devices to enhance privacy and reduce response latency. To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors, and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference, leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth.
  In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of heterogeneous processors, SoC memory bandwidth, etc. Drawing on these observations, we propose different heterogeneous parallel mechanisms to fully exploit both GPU and NPU computational power and memory bandwidth. We further design a fast synchronization mechanism between heterogeneous processors that leverages the unified memory architecture. By employing these techniques, we present HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports GPU-NPU heterogeneous execution. Evaluation shows that HeteroInfer delivers a 1.34x to 6.02x end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-only and NPU-only LLM engines, while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce k-NLPmeans and k-LLMmeans, text-clustering variants of k-means that periodically replace numeric centroids with textual summaries. The key idea, summary-as-centroid, retains k-means assignments in embedding space while producing human-readable, auditable cluster prototypes. The method is LLM-optional: k-NLPmeans uses lightweight, deterministic summarizers, enabling offline, low-cost, and stable operation; k-LLMmeans is a drop-in upgrade that uses an LLM for summaries under a fixed per-iteration budget whose cost does not grow with dataset size. We also present a mini-batch extension for real-time clustering of streaming text. Across diverse datasets, embedding models, and summarization strategies, our approach consistently outperforms classical baselines and approaches the accuracy of recent LLM-based clustering-without extensive LLM calls. Finally, we provide a case study on sequential text streams and release a StackExchange-derived benchmark for evaluating streaming text clustering.

Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose DiffSampling, a new decoding method that leverages a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. In addition, we also propose two variations of the proposed method that aim to correct the subtle inconsistencies of common sampling strategies. Experiments involving four different text-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least on par with the existing methods it builds upon in terms of quality, while potentially improving output diversity.

<title>Sample Complexity of Linear Quadratic Regulator Without Initial Stability</title>

Abstract: Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown dynamics. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riccati operator under the Riemannian distance. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Recent work proposed state-space models (SSMs) as an efficient alternative to transformer-based LLMs. Can these models be pruned to further reduce their computation costs? We adapt several pruning methods to the SSM structure, and apply them to four SSM-based LLMs across multiple tasks. We find that such models are quite robust to some pruning methods (e.g. WANDA), while using other methods lead to fast performance degradation.

Abstract: The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to approximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common choice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of the parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy. This paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the blocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using learnable transport maps. We call the resulting joint distribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula models are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational approximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block sizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of the variational optimization using efficient stochastic gradient methods. The approach is demonstrated using four different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that are challenging to approximate. This includes models that use global-local shrinkage priors for regularization, and hierarchical models for smoothing and heteroscedastic time series. In all cases, our method produces more accurate posterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block independence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational cost. A python package implementing the method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/YuFuOliver/VCVI_Rep_PyPackage.

Abstract: While guided decoding, especially value-guided methods, has emerged as a cost-effective alternative for controlling language model outputs without re-training models, its effectiveness is limited by the accuracy of the value function. We identify that this inaccuracy stems from a core distributional gap: existing methods train static value functions on trajectories sampled exclusively from the base policy, which inherently confines their training to a narrow and suboptimal view of the potential output space. We propose Iterative Value Refinement, a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. It employs Value Exploration to provide a more comprehensive and robust training signal, complemented by Iterative Self-Refinement, which uses the improved value function from one iteration to guide the generation of higher-quality data for the next. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in aligning language models. Our approach not only achieves alignment but also significantly reduces computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.

Abstract: Topic models are widely used for discovering latent thematic structures in large text corpora, yet traditional unsupervised methods often struggle to align with pre-defined conceptual domains. This paper introduces seeded Poisson Factorization (SPF), a novel approach that extends the Poisson Factorization (PF) framework by incorporating domain knowledge through seed words. SPF enables a structured topic discovery by modifying the prior distribution of topic-specific term intensities, assigning higher initial rates to pre-defined seed words. The model is estimated using variational inference with stochastic gradient optimization, ensuring scalability to large datasets.
  We present in detail the results of applying SPF to an Amazon customer feedback dataset, leveraging pre-defined product categories as guiding structures. SPF achieves superior performance compared to alternative guided probabilistic topic models in terms of computational efficiency and classification performance. Robustness checks highlight SPF's ability to adaptively balance domain knowledge and data-driven topic discovery, even in case of imperfect seed word selection. Further applications of SPF to four additional benchmark datasets, where the corpus varies in size and the number of topics differs, demonstrate its general superior classification performance compared to the unseeded PF model.

Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.

<title>PRO-VPT: Distribution-Adaptive Visual Prompt Tuning via Prompt Relocation</title>

arXiv:2503.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual prompt tuning (VPT), i.e., fine-tuning some lightweight prompt tokens, provides an efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. However, most prior art indiscriminately uses a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block varying depending on the task. In this paper, we introduce adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by tackling two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through empirical analysis, we first confirm that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution built upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy derived from this formulation, comprising two steps: pruning idle prompts from prompt-saturated blocks, followed by allocating these prompts to the most prompt-needed blocks. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal can adaptively learn the optimal prompt distribution in a nested optimization-based manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms advanced VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6 pp and 2.0 pp average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on VTAB-1k and FGVC benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/aSleepyTree/EB-Cache.

Abstract: Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots, playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with an external knowledge base to improve the answer relevance and accuracy. In real-world scenarios, beyond pure text, a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in tables, and user questions often require retrieving answers that are distributed across multiple tables. Retrieving knowledge from a table corpora (i.e., various individual tables) for a question remains nascent, at least, for (i) how to understand intra- and inter-table knowledge effectively, (ii) how to filter unnecessary tables and how to retrieve the most relevant tables efficiently, (iii) how to prompt LLMs to infer over the retrieval, (iv) how to evaluate the corresponding performance in a realistic setting. Facing the above challenges, in this paper, we first propose a table-corpora-aware RAG framework, named T-RAG, which consists of the hierarchical memory index, multi-stage retrieval, and graph-aware prompting for effective and efficient table knowledge retrieval and inference. Further, we first develop a multi-table question answering benchmark named MultiTableQA, which spans 3 different task types, 57,193 tables, and 23,758 questions in total, and the sources are all from real-world scenarios. Based on MultiTableQA, we did the holistic comparison over table retrieval methods, RAG methods, and table-to-graph representation learning methods, where T-RAG shows the leading accuracy, recall, and running time performance. Also, under T-RAG, we evaluate the inference ability upgrade of different LLMs. Code and Data are available at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/T-RAG

Abstract: We introduce magnitude and direction (MAD) policies, a policy parameterization for reinforcement learning (RL) that preserves Lp closed-loop stability for nonlinear dynamical systems. Despite their completeness in describing all stabilizing controllers, methods based on nonlinear Youla and system-level synthesis are significantly impacted by the difficulty of parametrizing Lp-stable operators. In contrast, MAD policies introduce explicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the success of reinforcement learning pipelines - without jeopardizing closed-loop stability. This is achieved by letting the magnitude of the control input be described by a disturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on state-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further characterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model mismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parametrizations, MAD policies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL pipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability with no model information beyond assuming open-loop stability. Numerical experiments show that MAD policies trained with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods generalize to unseen scenarios - matching the performance of standard neural network policies while guaranteeing closed-loop stability by design.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating biases is critical for the adoption of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making. We introduce Admissions and Hiring, decision tasks with hypothetical applicant profiles where a person's race can be inferred from their name, as simplified test beds for racial bias. We show that Gemma 2B Instruct and LLaMA 3.2 3B Instruct exhibit strong biases. Gemma grants admission to 26% more White than Black applicants, and LLaMA hires 60% more Asian than White applicants. We demonstrate that these biases are resistant to prompt engineering: multiple prompting strategies all fail to promote fairness. In contrast, using distributed alignment search, we can identify "race subspaces" within model activations and intervene on them to debias model decisions. Averaging the representation across all races within the subspaces reduces Gemma's bias by 37-57%. Finally, we examine the generalizability of Gemma's race subspaces, and find limited evidence for generalization, where changing the prompt format can affect the race representation. Our work suggests mechanistic approaches may provide a promising venue for improving the fairness of LLMs, but a universal race representation remains elusive.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification plays an important role in achieving trustworthy and reliable learning-based computational imaging. Recent advances in generative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development of uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative model-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on the underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the posterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian neural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction method by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters. Unfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly quantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still persists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an existing generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and introduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by leveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be easily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and image inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the characteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on top of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent with frequentist principles.

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, making powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models a core solution. The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy systems. This paper presents the winning solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024). The solution provides accurate probabilistic forecasts for a wind-solar hybrid system, and achieves substantial trading revenue in the day-ahead electricity market. Key components include: (1) a stacking-based approach combining sister forecasts from various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) to provide wind power forecasts, (2) an online solar post-processing model to address the distribution shift in the online test set caused by increased solar capacity, (3) a probabilistic aggregation method for accurate quantile forecasts of hybrid generation, and (4) a stochastic trading strategy to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices. This paper also explores the potential of end-to-end learning to further enhance the trading revenue by shifting the distribution of forecast errors. Detailed case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. Code for all mentioned methods is available for reproduction and further research in both industry and academia.

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences. While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expression*: early layers progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers express these representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline not only substantially surpasses the previously best-performing method, yielding a 69\% relative improvement in accuracy (Dice Score from 42.53 to 71.81), but also performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training with faithful images-containing same features but different noise-outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts generalization by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer on CIFAR-10/100, and TinyImageNet, with various optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet.

Abstract: Effective feature selection is vital for robust and interpretable medical prediction, especially for identifying risk factors concentrated in extreme patient strata. Standard methods emphasize average associations and may miss predictors whose importance lies in the tails of the distribution. We propose a computationally efficient supervised filter that ranks features using the Gumbel copula upper tail dependence coefficient ($\lambda_U$), prioritizing variables that are simultaneously extreme with the positive class. We benchmarked against Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and $L_1$ Elastic Net across four classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Evaluation included paired statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks with label flips, feature noise, and missingness. On CDC, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by about 52% while retaining strong discrimination. Although using all 21 features yielded the highest AUC, our filter significantly outperformed Mutual Information and mRMR and was statistically indistinguishable from ReliefF. On PIMA, with only eight predictors, our ranking produced the numerically highest ROC AUC, and no significant differences were found versus strong baselines. Across both datasets, the upper tail criterion consistently identified clinically coherent, impactful predictors. We conclude that copula based feature selection via upper tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable approach for building risk models in public health and clinical medicine.

<title>Query Drift Compensation: Enabling Compatibility in Continual Learning of Retrieval Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: Text embedding models enable semantic search, powering several NLP applications like Retrieval Augmented Generation by efficient information retrieval (IR). However, text embedding models are commonly studied in scenarios where the training data is static, thus limiting its applications to dynamic scenarios where new training data emerges over time. IR methods generally encode a huge corpus of documents to low-dimensional embeddings and store them in a database index. During retrieval, a semantic search over the corpus is performed and the document whose embedding is most similar to the query embedding is returned. When updating an embedding model with new training data, using the already indexed corpus is suboptimal due to the non-compatibility issue, since the model which was used to obtain the embeddings of the corpus has changed. While re-indexing of old corpus documents using the updated model enables compatibility, it requires much higher computation and time. Thus, it is critical to study how the already indexed corpus can still be effectively used without the need of re-indexing. In this work, we establish a continual learning benchmark with large-scale datasets and continually train dense retrieval embedding models on query-document pairs from new datasets in each task and observe forgetting on old tasks due to significant drift of embeddings. We employ embedding distillation on both query and document embeddings to maintain stability and propose a novel query drift compensation method during retrieval to project new model query embeddings to the old embedding space. This enables compatibility with previously indexed corpus embeddings extracted using the old model and thus reduces the forgetting. We show that the proposed method significantly improves performance without any re-indexing. Code is available at https://github.com/dipamgoswami/QDC.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small molecules, peptides, and proteins.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach to leverage Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. However, choosing optimal quantum circuits that efficiently solve a given VQA problem is a non-trivial task. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) algorithms enable automatic generation of quantum circuits tailored to the provided problem. Existing QAS approaches typically adapt classical neural architecture search techniques, training machine learning models to sample relevant circuits, but often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By reformulating QAS from a quantum perspective, we propose a sampling-free differentiable QAS algorithm that models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, which emerges from the search space of quantum circuits. The mixed state formulation also enables our method to incorporate generic noise models, for example the depolarizing channel, which cannot be modeled by state vector simulation. We validate our method by finding circuits for state initialization and Hamiltonian optimization tasks, namely the variational quantum eigensolver and the unweighted max-cut problems. We show our approach to be comparable to, if not outperform, existing QAS techniques while requiring significantly fewer quantum simulations during training, and also show improved robustness levels to noise.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups and susceptible to strategic manipulation. To address this issue, we develop a novel preference learning framework capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Grounded in social choice theory, our approach infers the feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of population-proportional alignment and population-bounded manipulability. Moreover, we propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs population-proportional alignment with the selection of the Condorcet winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments on both tabular recommendation tasks and large language model alignment.

<title>Learning What Reinforcement Learning Can't: Interleaved Online Fine-Tuning for Hardest Questions</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach, \textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data, highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the significant potential.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either human annotation or expensive experiments. In theory, powerful pre-trained AI models provide an opportunity to automatically label datasets and save costs. Unfortunately, these models come with no guarantees on their accuracy, making wholesale replacement of manual labeling impractical. In this work, we propose a method for leveraging pre-trained AI models to curate cost-effective and high-quality datasets. In particular, our approach results in probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall labeling error is small. Our method is nonasymptotically valid under minimal assumptions on the dataset or the AI model being studied, and thus enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are powerful machine-learning models capable of capturing intricate non-linear relationships. They are widely used nowadays across numerous scientific and engineering domains, driving advancements in both research and real-world applications. In our recent work, we focused on the statics and dynamics of a particular subclass of ANNs, which we refer to as binary ANNs. A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which both inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly suitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached binary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key insights. Most notably, we demonstrated that the knowledge embodied in a binary ANN (expressed through its input-output behaviour) can be symbolically represented using a propositional logic language. Moreover, the process of modifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a gradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously, the training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set transitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief change. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by addressing some critical limitations of our previous study. Specifically, we show that Dalal's method for belief change naturally induces a structured, gradual evolution of states of belief. More importantly, given the known shortcomings of full-meet belief change, we demonstrate that the training dynamics of binary ANNs can be more effectively modelled using robust AGM-style change operations -- namely, lexicographic revision and moderate contraction -- that align with the Darwiche-Pearl framework for iterated belief change.

Abstract: Generative ML models are increasingly popular in networking for tasks such as telemetry imputation, prediction, and synthetic trace generation. Despite their capabilities, they suffer from two shortcomings: (i) their output is often visibly violating well-known networking rules, which undermines their trustworthiness; and (ii) they are difficult to control, frequently requiring retraining even for minor changes.
  To address these limitations and unlock the benefits of generative models for networking, we propose a new paradigm for integrating explicit network knowledge in the form of first-order logic rules into ML models used for networking tasks. Rules capture well-known relationships among used signals, e.g., that increased latency precedes packet loss. While the idea is conceptually straightforward, its realization is challenging: networking knowledge is rarely formalized into rules, and naively injecting them into ML models often hampers ML's effectiveness. This paper introduces NetNomos a multi-stage framework that (1) learns rules directly from data (e.g., measurements); (2) filters them to distinguish semantically meaningful ones; and (3) enforces them through a collaborative generation between an ML model and an SMT solver.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction capability is essential for deploying LLMs in safety-critical applications. We uncover a systematic failure: LLMs cannot correct errors in their own outputs while successfully correcting identical errors from external sources - a limitation we term the Self-Correction Blind Spot. To study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, an evaluation framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 open-source non-reasoning models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We provide multiple lines of evidence suggesting this limitation may be influenced by training data: human demonstrations rarely include error-correction sequences (favoring error-free responses), whereas reinforcement learning (RL) trained models learn error correction via outcome feedback. Remarkably, appending a minimal "Wait" prompt activates a 89.3% reduction in blind spots, suggesting dormant capabilities that require triggering. Our work highlights a critical limitation potentially influenced by training distribution and offers a practical approach to enhance LLM reliability and trustworthiness - vital for safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we introduce a new conformal score function called prevalence-adjusted softmax that targets macro-coverage, a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage. Second, we propose a new procedure that interpolates between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction by linearly interpolating their conformal score thresholds. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet-300K and iNaturalist-2018, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically consistently outperforming all baseline models across different base models and test sets, achieving the best PickScore in every case, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Abstract: Outliers can severely distort causal effect estimation in observational studies, especially in small samples. We develop a doubly robust estimator of the ATE under a contaminated-data model that explicitly accommodates outliers. Robustness to outliers is delivered via a bounded-influence estimating equation for the outcome model and covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) for treatment assignment. To mitigate overfitting in high dimensions, we incorporate variable selection and unify all components within a penalized empirical likelihood framework. For further inference, we derive an optimal finite-sample confidence interval (CI) whose endpoints are invariant to outliers under the contaminated model. Across extensive simulations and two gene-expression applications (Golub; Khan pediatric tumor), the proposed ATE estimator and finite-sample CI outperform state-of-the-art competitors in bias, mean squared error, empirical coverage, and interval length over a wide range of contamination levels and sample sizes.

Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.

<title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.

<title>Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention</title>

arXiv:2508.02124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is ever-increasing, yet the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention presents a significant bottleneck. While existing sparse attention mechanisms enhance efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as static patterns and information loss. This paper introduces a Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention mechanism that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, it leverages value vectors to dynamically generate content-aware sparse masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and focus on crucial information. Second, it implements a position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we ensure that the introduced dynamic masks and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, thereby supporting end-to-end training. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to retain complete information while significantly reducing computational complexity, achieving an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. We validate the performance of Dynamic Mask Attention through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies demonstrate that our method consistently achieves Pareto dominance across various tasks, including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, general benchmarks, and needle-in-a-haystack tests, delivering up to 10 times acceleration. These results highlight its capability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling. Our computational kernel is open-sourced at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to facilitate further research and application within the community.

Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task aims to model annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and perspectivist evaluation, which focuses on modeling individual annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and improvements. In this paper, we extend DisCo by introducing annotator metadata embeddings, enhancing input representations, and multi-objective training losses to capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth calibration and error analyses that reveal when and why disagreement-aware modeling improves. Our findings show that disagreement can be better captured by conditioning on annotator demographics and by optimizing directly for distributional metrics, yielding consistent improvements across datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. We introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench, featuring simple math and general queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11 challenging reasoning tasks along with harder math problems. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we extensively evaluate 33 different thinking and non-thinking models and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other, highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, employ structured second-moment estimations and have shown strong performance for training neural networks (NNs). In practice, however, Shampoo typically requires step-size grafting with Adam to be competitive, and SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis -- at the cost of additional memory overhead from Adam in both methods. Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam. Across our experiments, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms SOAP, Shampoo, and even KL-SOAP, establishing the KL-based approach as a compelling foundation for designing structured methods in NN optimization.

arXiv:2509.04439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. We evaluate on ARC-AGI, a benchmark that stresses compositional generalization and abstract reasoning, making it a natural fit for concept memory. Our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms fixed settings, supporting the hypothesis that accumulating and abstracting patterns enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code is available at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.

<title>Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation</title>

Abstract: Large language models are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection or prompting strategy). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I (false positive), Type II (false negative), Type S (wrong sign), or Type M (exaggerated effect) errors. We call this phenomenon where configuration choices lead to incorrect conclusions LLM hacking.
  We find that intentional LLM hacking is strikingly simple. By replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science studies, we show that, with just a handful of prompt paraphrases, virtually anything can be presented as statistically significant.
  Beyond intentional manipulation, our analysis of 13 million labels from 18 different LLMs across 2361 realistic hypotheses shows that there is also a high risk of accidental LLM hacking, even when following standard research practices. We find incorrect conclusions in approximately 31% of hypotheses for state-of-the-art LLMs, and in half the hypotheses for smaller language models. While higher task performance and stronger general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models remain susceptible. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of LLM-based findings near significance thresholds. We analyze 21 mitigation techniques and find that human annotations provide crucial protection against false positives. Common regression estimator correction techniques can restore valid inference but trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  We publish a list of practical recommendations to prevent LLM hacking.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation. Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy applications.

arXiv:2509.11465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

arXiv:2509.14275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning (FL) without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per-round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.

Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of Illusion.

arXiv:2509.19341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

arXiv:2509.21387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

<title>HEART: Emotionally-driven test-time scaling of Language Models</title>

arXiv:2509.22876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise, emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

<title>Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data. Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The study investigates gradient descent in matrix factorization and discovers a fractal structure in the parameter space when using large step sizes. The exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization is calculated, demonstrating that the selected minimizer is highly dependent on the initialization near criticality. Furthermore, the addition of regularization amplifies this sensitivity, resulting in the creation of a fractal boundary separating convergent and divergent initializations. This phenomenon extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. The research uncovers that near-critical step sizes lead to a chaotic regime in gradient descent, where long-term dynamics become unpredictable without any clear implicit biases towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness. <div>

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases, such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Summary:
The work introduces a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), for enhancing team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). By constructing a learnable representation space that captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information through communication protocols, IWoL enables fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination without the drawbacks of explicit message passing. The representation serves as both an implicit latent and an explicit message for communication among agents. Evaluation on four challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of IWoL in facilitating team coordination. Additionally, combining IWoL with existing MARL algorithms further improves their performance. Overall, IWoL provides a simple yet powerful solution for addressing the complexities of team coordination in MARL.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data. Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system. Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to other components in industrial manufacturing.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in overparameterized deep matrix factorization problems. This resolves a previously unanswered question and sheds light on the sharpness measure of the loss landscape in deep neural network training.

arXiv:2509.25783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.

Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used to enhance extreme value forecasting. Deep learning models like Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM are employed for both short- and long-term predictions of extremes.

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary sequences.

Two architectures are investigated, with OpenTSLM-Flamingo outperforming baselines in text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. OpenTSLM models show high performance in sleep staging and HAR tasks, surpassing finetuned text-only models and even larger GPT models. OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences while maintaining stable memory requirements. SoftPrompt, on the other hand, requires exponentially more memory with sequence length. Expert reviews by clinicians find OpenTSLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities on ECG-QA. All code, datasets, and models are provided open-source to facilitate further research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is crucial for various applications such as flood forecasting and climate analysis. Existing methods often struggle to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes in rainfall. RainSeer, a new framework, interprets radar reflectivity as a structural prior to predict rain development accurately. It addresses challenges by translating radar fields into point-wise rainfall observations and bridging the gap between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer consists of a two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper aligns radar structures with ground-level rainfall, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the transformation of hydro-meteors through descent and evaporation using a spatiotemporal attention mechanism. Evaluation on public datasets shows RainSeer outperforms existing methods, reducing MAE by 13.31% and improving the fidelity of reconstructed rainfall fields. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS) measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however, introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii) bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall, through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France, 2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields.

<div> Keywords: Foundation models, black-box services, Advisor Models, reinforcement learning, dynamic optimization <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Advisor Models, which are trained with reinforcement learning to provide natural language steering instructions in real-time to black-box models. These lightweight parametric policies adapt to different inputs, users, or environments, improving downstream task performance compared to static prompt optimizers. Advisor Models outperform static approaches by reacting in-context and learning dynamics of the environment. The study demonstrates the generalizability of advisors across different black-box models and their ability to specialize while remaining robust to out-of-distribution inputs. Advisor Models serve as a learnable interface to black-box systems, acting as environment-specific memory and enabling personalization and adaptable AI with advanced capabilities. Dynamic optimization through Advisor Models shows promise for enhancing the performance and adaptability of black-box models in various domains. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

<div> market-based selector, training data, cost-function prediction market, coverage, aggregation strength

Summary:
The article introduces a novel market-based selector for choosing a subset of training data, addressing the challenge of diverse signals such as uncertainty and rarity. The selector uses a cost-function prediction market (LMSR) where signals act as traders, with a single liquidity parameter controlling concentration. Token budgets are managed through a price-per-token rule, with an interpretable length bias. A diversity head enhances coverage, measured through topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. The LMSR implementation results in maximum-entropy aggregation with transparent knobs for aggregation strength. Empirical results on datasets like GSM8K and AGNews show competitive performance with reduced variance and improved balance and stability. The framework provides a unified approach for multi-signal data curation under fixed computational resources, beneficial for prompt-level reasoning and classification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

Summary:
This study investigates the impact of post-training quantization (PTQ) on neural network performance in safety-critical environments. The researchers explore the concept of extreme failure resulting from dynamic PTQ and develop a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to identify network and bit-width policy pairs that may lead to catastrophic failure under quantization. Results demonstrate the existence of detrimental network-policy pairs with performance reductions of up to 65% in accuracy, compared to robust counterparts with less than a 2% decrease. The study highlights the vulnerability points of networks under PTQ and emphasizes the need for caution in real-world deployment. The findings underscore the importance of rigorous examinations of robustness and safety considerations in future deep learning research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this "detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their "robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep learning.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical, constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for efficient training.

<br />
Summary: 
This study explores enhancing biomolecule efficacy prediction using the uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection in the context of in-context learners like TabPFN. The research demonstrates that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features outperforms specialized predictors for an siRNA knockdown efficacy task. The study reveals that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR) correlates negatively with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, better performance is achieved compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This highlights the significance of leveraging model uncertainty as a label-free heuristic to optimize biomolecule efficacy predictions. <div>
arXiv:2510.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Summary:
Litespark is a new pre-training framework that aims to address the inefficiencies in training Large Language Models (LLMs). By optimizing transformer attention and MLP layers, Litespark focuses on maximizing Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while remaining compatible with standard transformer implementations. The framework has shown significant performance improvements, with 2x-6x training throughput enhancement and 55%-83% reduction in energy consumption on multi-node H200 GPU clusters when benchmarked on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters. These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<div> Keywords: factored Markov decision processes, sample-efficient algorithms, deep reinforcement learning, Action-Controllable Factorization, contrastive learning

Summary:
ACF is a new approach to address the representation problem in reinforcement learning by discovering independently controllable latent variables from high-dimensional observations. It leverages sparsity in the fact that actions only affect a subset of variables, allowing for more efficient training. ACF directly recovers ground truth controllable factors from pixel observations on benchmark tasks with known factored structure, such as Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey. Through contrastive training, ACF outperforms baseline disentanglement algorithms consistently. This innovative technique bridges the gap between sample-efficient algorithms that rely on factored representations and deep reinforcement learning methods that handle high-dimensional inputs, offering a promising solution for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms in complex environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: ACF is a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables from high-dimensional observations, leveraging sparsity and achieving superior performance on benchmark tasks with known factored structure. <div>
arXiv:2510.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

<div> Reinforcement learning, extremum seeking, robust control, time-varying systems, deep learning<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the utilization of robust model-independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to enhance the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for nonlinear time-varying systems. While DRL has the potential to efficiently control large-parameter systems through data learning, its performance deteriorates when the system model changes rapidly. Bounded ES is effective for handling time-varying systems with unknown control directions but its convergence speed decreases as the number of parameters increases. By combining DRL and bounded ES, a hybrid controller is created that outperforms individual methods, with DRL leveraging historical data to quickly control a complex system while bounded ES ensures robustness to time variations. The study includes numerical analysis on a general time-varying system and the application of the combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at a linear particle accelerator. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Summary:  
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is shown to be equivalent to Inverse Reinforcement Learning, indicating it learns a dense token-level reward model in addition to policy imitation.  
- A baseline-relative reward function is formulated to recover the dense reward signal directly from the SFT model.  
- The dense reward model allows for granular credit assignment for each token generated, offering benefits for policy improvement.  
- The Dense-Path REINFORCE method, utilizing recovered rewards, outperforms original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.  
- This work reframes SFT as a powerful reward learning mechanism, providing new opportunities to leverage expert demonstrations. <div>
arXiv:2510.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.

Summary:
- Analog in-memory computing accelerators use resistive crossbar arrays with memristive devices to efficiently perform deep neural network computations in memory.
- To achieve effective in-memory training, at least 8-bit conductance states are typically required, but many memristive devices offer only about 4-bit resolution.
- The proposed residual learning framework sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate for the errors from low-precision weight updates.
- The theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap decreases with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate.
- Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art analog training strategies under limited-state settings with moderate hardware overhead. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays, where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least 8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about 4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our cost analysis.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel method for graph generation that incorporates spectral eigenmaps to embed input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. By defining geodesic flows between these embeddings and matching distributions along these flows, SFMG captures the geometric structure of graphs beyond eigenvalues. This approach allows for flexible generation of diverse graphs and scales efficiently, offering up to 30 times speedup over diffusion-based models. Empirical results demonstrate SFMG's ability to perform on par with existing methods on various graph metrics while also generalizing well to unseen graph scales. SFMG provides a new and efficient approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow matching.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i) captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to 30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow matching.

Summary: <br />
- The study introduces a novel methodology for comparing artificial neural network models to brain responses, based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC), enabling accurate mapping between model activations and neural data.
- By applying the IATC in simulated neural network populations, mice, and humans, the study demonstrates its ability to map bidirectionally and identify detailed aspects of neural mechanisms, such as non-linear activation functions.
- The IATC facilitates accurate predictions of neural activity and specificity in mechanism identification, allowing for the distinction of response patterns from different brain areas while aligning responses within the same areas across subjects.
- The findings support the use of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system, showcasing the compatibility of neural engineering goals and neuroscientific objectives in model-brain comparisons.
- Overall, the IATC-based approach enhances previous methods of model-brain comparison, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the predictive success and mechanistic accuracy of artificial neural network models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3) identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants (GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63, AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

The paper introduces a novel method called High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN) to enhance the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By leveraging high-order node derivatives of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), HOD-GNN generates structure-aware node embeddings that are processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. The resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy, demonstrating strong performance on graph learning benchmarks. The paper also establishes connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. Additionally, a message-passing algorithm is developed for efficiently computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs by leveraging graph sparsity and parallelism. The innovative approach of utilizing derivatives of GNNs to enhance expressivity represents a significant advancement in the field of graph representation learning.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism. Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Summary: 
This article discusses the use of machine learning (ML) in large-scale hydrologic modeling, focusing on the development of physically-interpretable models.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding. Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially- and temporally-varying process dominance.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MINERVA, a novel approach to supervised feature selection that utilizes neural networks to estimate mutual information between features and targets. By decoupling representation learning from feature selection, MINERVA achieves better generalization and accurately captures complex feature-target relationships. The method employs a carefully designed loss function with sparsity-inducing regularizers to select optimal feature subsets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets, MINERVA demonstrates its efficacy in identifying exact solutions and effectively capturing ubiquitous dependency structures not typically addressed in existing literature. The two-stage process of MINERVA allows for an ensemble evaluation of feature subsets, providing a comprehensive understanding of feature importance in high-dimensional datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets. We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection, ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform exact solutions.

Summary:  
TabImpute is a pre-trained transformer model designed for imputing missing values in tabular datasets. It improves upon existing methods by offering accurate and fast imputations without the need for hyperparameter tuning at inference time. The model benefits from an entry-wise featurization technique that speeds up the process significantly compared to previous approaches. Additionally, a synthetic training data generation pipeline enhances the performance of TabImpute at test time by incorporating realistic missingness patterns.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks. However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists. Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning, we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering, showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established imputation methods.

Summary: AdaLoRA introduces dynamic rank allocation for fine-tuning large language models, but faces slow convergence and high computational overhead. To address this, HyperAdaLoRA uses a hypernetwork to accelerate convergence by dynamically generating parameters for SVD. By pruning the hypernetwork outputs, dynamic rank allocation is achieved.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used to reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses. The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3 and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective, while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a purpose-built inspection vehicle.

<div> dataset, evaluation, benchmark, tutoring, LLMs 

Summary:
The article introduces TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark aimed at assessing the tutoring skills of large language models (LLMs) used as learning aids by students. The dataset consists of 1,490 samples focused on high-school and AP-level curricula, covering tasks such as generating adaptive explanations, providing feedback, and promoting active learning. Rubrics specific to each sample are used to evaluate LLM responses, with results showing that current LLMs struggle to effectively guide and support students. None of the frontier LLMs achieved a score above 56%, indicating significant room for improvement in tutoring capabilities. Different model families exhibit varied strengths and weaknesses, with some excelling in certain skills while lagging in others. TutorBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to guide the development of more effective AI tutors in the future.

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids, it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive, provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring, samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively, with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

<div> Keywords: permutation-equivariant learning rules, neuron distribution, topological constraints, expressivity, deep learning

Summary: 
Permutation-equivariant learning rules such as SGD and Adam induce a bi-Lipschitz mapping between neurons and heavily constrain the topology of neuron distributions during training. This constraint reveals a distinction between small and large learning rates. When the learning rate is below a critical point, the training process preserves all topological structures of neurons. However, above this critical point, the process allows for topological simplifications, leading to a coarser neuron manifold and reduced model expressivity. This phenomenon, combined with the edge of stability discovery, divides the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent into two phases: smooth optimization under topological constraints followed by learning through topological simplifications. The theory is agnostic to specific architectures or loss functions, allowing for the universal application of topological methods in studying deep learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules (including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity. Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

<div> exponent concentration, low-precision floating-point formats, GenAI weights, ECF8, entropy-aware encoding

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of low-precision computation in dealing with the increasing size of Generative AI models. It highlights the benefits of low-precision floating-point formats in terms of numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency. The study reveals an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights, where exponents consistently show low entropy due to $\alpha$-stable distributions from stochastic gradient descent. This leads to a theoretical compression limit around FP4.67 and the proposal of a practical FP8 format called Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8). Experimental results on large language models and diverse transcriptions show significant memory savings and throughput acceleration with perfectly lossless computations. This work establishes exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and paves the way for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

<div> Recursive reasoning, curriculum learning, architectural depth, training efficiency, Sudoku

<br><br>Summary:  
The paper introduces CGAR, an innovative training methodology for recursive reasoning models that significantly reduces computational cost by applying curriculum learning to architectural depth instead of traditional data order. It consists of two key components: Progressive Depth Curriculum, which gradually increases recursion depth during training to avoid early overfitting and reduce computational time, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting, which assigns exponentially decreasing weights to supervision steps to match the diminishing gradient magnitude. On the Sudoku-Extreme dataset with over 423,000 puzzles, CGAR achieves a 1.71x speedup in training time, cutting it from 10.93 to 6.38 hours with only a minimal accuracy decrease of 0.63% (from 86.65% to 86.02%). Ablation studies show that Progressive Depth Curriculum alone provides a 2.26x speedup while maintaining competitive accuracy at 85.47%, representing a rare Pareto improvement where training efficiency and solution quality both increase. Additionally, models trained with CGAR demonstrate improved inference efficiency, achieving 100% halting accuracy and requiring 11% fewer reasoning steps. This work highlights how the application of an architectural depth curriculum can make training recursive reasoning models more accessible on modest hardware without sacrificing performance. The authors provide code and pretrained models publicly. <div>

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

<div> Method of Moments, Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis, Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, physics-informed neural network, electromagnetic modeling<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the limitations of the traditional Method of Moments (MoM) in electromagnetic modeling, which relies on static, geometry-fixed basis functions like the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. The authors reframe electromagnetic modeling by introducing a learnable basis representation framework instead of solving for coefficients on a fixed basis. They reveal that the RWG basis can be viewed as a static, piecewise-linear instantiation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Building on this insight, they propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that generalizes RWG into a flexible, adaptive basis family. PhyKAN is derived from the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) and combines a local KAN branch with a global branch incorporating Green’s function priors to ensure physical consistency in the model. Experimental results on canonical geometries demonstrate that PhyKAN achieves very low reconstruction errors (sub-0.01) and provides accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions. The approach offers an interpretable and physics-consistent connection between classical electromagnetic solvers and modern neural network architectures, potentially advancing both modeling accuracy and efficiency in computational electromagnetics. <div>

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.

<div> Keywords: fairness, differential privacy, human oversight, machine learning, stakeholder input<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge of balancing accuracy, fairness, and privacy in machine learning systems that impact critical areas such as healthcare, finance, hiring, and public services. It notes that achieving all three objectives is complex since differential privacy may exacerbate disparities, fairness interventions often require sensitive data prohibited by privacy, and existing automated pipelines fail to incorporate human judgment in fairness decisions. To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a framework that integrates human oversight into machine learning design and deployment. FAIRPLAI operates by constructing privacy-fairness frontiers to transparently illustrate trade-offs between accuracy, privacy, and group outcomes. It also enables interactive input from stakeholders, allowing decision-makers to choose fairness criteria and operating points aligned with their specific domains. Additionally, FAIRPLAI includes a differentially private auditing loop, permitting humans to review explanations and edge cases securely without jeopardizing individual privacy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FAIRPLAI maintains strong privacy guarantees while reducing fairness disparities compared to automated baselines. Ultimately, FAIRPLAI offers a user-friendly, interpretable approach for practitioners to simultaneously manage accuracy, privacy, and fairness, embedding human judgment where it is most crucial and promoting responsible, trustworthy machine learning applications. <div>

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

<div> Keywords: ultimatum game, dictator game, Large Language Models, system prompt, fairness

Summary: 
The study introduces the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to investigate the impact of system prompts on the behavior of Large Language Models in behavioral science experiments like the ultimatum and dictator games. By using neutral prompt variations, the framework aims to provide more reliable insights into agent preferences and analyze linguistic features in model responses. The research reveals that LLM agents often show a preference for fairness, highlighting the significant influence of the system prompt on their behavior. Linguistic analysis of model responses uncovers variations in expression patterns. Despite challenges related to prompt sensitivity, the proposed framework establishes a solid foundation for studying the behavior of LLM agents in complex scenarios. The code artifacts for the study are available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies. Our code artifacts are available at https://github.com/andreaseinwiller/LLM-ABS.

Summary: <br>
Urban congestion leads to inefficient vehicle movement, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and urban air pollution. A new study leverages large-scale traffic and emission data from probe vehicles in U.S. urban areas to predict network-wide emission rates using machine learning methods. This approach provides insights into the relationship between emissions and traffic variables, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimization of travel demand allocation to reduce congestion and emissions. The data-driven eMFD models developed in this study offer a deeper understanding of the factors influencing emission rates, such as network characteristics, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle features. These findings enable transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport, make informed traffic management decisions, and plan strategies to mitigate network-wide emissions. <div>

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Summary:
The study focuses on graph coarsening using Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Two algorithms, Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC) and $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), are proposed to merge nodes based on distortion measures. GPC method iteratively merges nodes to minimize distortion locally, while KGPC clusters nodes based on pairwise distortion metrics. Optimal coarsening is guaranteed under certain conditions, and the algorithms are validated on large datasets and clustering tasks. Results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods across various parameters and scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Summary: 
The article introduces Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs) to extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). By encoding a Turing-complete syntax in a high-dimensional vector space, the neural network states can have structured representations that are interpretable. The enhanced expressive power of the VSA encoding can be applied to machine learning tasks. The emphasis on encoding structured representations and designing neural networks that are sensitive to the structure of their representations is geared towards developing more intelligent agents. The goal is to create neural networks capable of handling complex structures and fostering more general intelligence. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes. A version of this note previously appeared on the author's personal website without context. Here we provide additional discussion and references to the relevant prior literature.

<div> Keywords: BayesQ, post-training quantization, uncertainty, posterior expected loss, mixed precision<br><br>Summary:<br><br>1. The paper introduces BayesQ, a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that optimizes quantization by minimizing the posterior expected loss, accounting for uncertainty in model weights. <br>2. BayesQ models weight uncertainty using a lightweight Gaussian posterior (default diagonal Laplace, with optional K-FAC/low-rank approximations) and whitens weights based on posterior covariance. <br>3.

An optional calibration-only distillation step is included to better align the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. <br>6. Experimental results show that at comparable average bits per weight (3.0/3.5/4.0), BayesQ consistently outperforms strong PTQ baselines like GPTQ on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE), achieving up to +1.5% top-1 accuracy improvement on RN50 and +1.1 GLUE points on BERT. <br>7. The preprocessing overhead of BayesQ is similar to that of GPTQ, making it both practical and effective. <br>8.

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

<div> Keywords: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, Temporal graphs, Graph embeddings, Temporal attention, Coordination strategies  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper introduces TIGER, a novel approach to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by explicitly modeling the temporal evolution of inter-agent coordination structures. Unlike existing MARL methods that rely on static or per-step relational graphs, TIGER captures dynamic dependencies by constructing temporal graphs that connect agents’ current and historical interactions over time. A temporal attention-based encoder is then used to aggregate information across these evolving structural and temporal neighborhoods, producing time-aware embeddings that inform cooperative policy learning. The approach addresses the natural changes in agent interactions as they adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies, which is critical for achieving robust and adaptive coordination. TIGER’s effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, showing consistent outperformance compared to various value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in terms of both task performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies highlight the impact of key design elements, illustrating how structural and temporal factors jointly influence effective policy learning in MARL. The authors also provide open-source implementation code to facilitate further research and application within the MARL community. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

<div> Keywords: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent, DPSGD, differential privacy, DP noise, clipping bias <br>
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new method, DP-PMLF, which aims to address the challenges of maintaining model accuracy while maintaining differential privacy in training deep neural networks. DP-PMLF combines per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to mitigate DP noise and clipping bias simultaneously. By using per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates before clipping and applying a low-pass filter to reduce DP noise post-processing, DP-PMLF demonstrates improved convergence rates under rigorous DP guarantees. The empirical evaluations show that DP-PMLF significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off compared to existing DPSGD variants. This approach provides a novel solution to the trade-off between privacy and accuracy in training deep neural networks with differential privacy. <br> <div>

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Topological descriptors are important for capturing structural information in relational data. This study investigates the impact of various filtrations on the product of graphs on topological descriptors like Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). The study finds that EC has limited expressive power on general color-based filtrations while PH descriptors on graph products provide more information compared to individual graphs. Algorithms are developed to compute PH diagrams for vertex- and edge-level filtrations on graph products. The study includes empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance to support the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Summary:<br>
Graph super-resolution aims to infer high-resolution graphs from low-resolution counterparts, crucial for resource-constrained fields like medicine. Current GNN-based methods have limitations like ignoring graph structure and relying on node representations for edge weights. The Bi-SR framework introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes for structure-aware node super-resolution. Meanwhile, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes in a dual graph to enable edge inference through standard GNNs. Evaluations on a real-world brain connectome dataset show state-of-the-art performance across various topological measures. Additionally, new simulated datasets capturing different topologies and LR-HR relationships facilitate comprehensive benchmarking efforts for graph super-resolution approaches.<br> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Summary:<br>
This article discusses the extension of Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models for interpretability. The updated causal importance function and new loss function developed for sequential data allow for successful decomposition of a toy induction-head model and GPT-2-small model. The study demonstrates that SPD can accurately identify interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball" within the parameters of the GPT-2-small model. By bridging the gap between traditional models and modern Transformer models, this work presents a promising approach for analyzing and intervening in complex neural network structures. The results showcase the potential of SPD in uncovering interpretable parameter-space mechanisms within sophisticated models, paving the way for future applications in real-world scenarios. 

<br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

<div> Keywords: Snow-Water Equivalent, spatio-temporal forecasting, deep learning, Gaussian process, uncertainty estimation  

<br><br>Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the challenge of forecasting Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE), a crucial measure used for estimating the water content in snowpacks within snow-dominant watersheds.  
2. SWE forecasting is difficult due to its spatio-temporal variability influenced by a variety of environmental and topographical factors, which classical methods have not fully exploited.

4. ForeSWE incorporates an attention mechanism to effectively capture and integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions.  
5. A Gaussian process module is integrated to provide principled uncertainty quantification alongside the point forecasts, enhancing decision-making confidence.  
6. The model was evaluated on a dataset collected from 512 SNOTEL stations across the Western United States.  
7. Results demonstrate significant improvements in both forecast accuracy and the quality of prediction intervals when compared to existing SWE forecasting methods.  
8. The study validates the effectiveness of combining deep learning with classical probabilistic models in environmental forecasting tasks, particularly in delivering meaningful uncertainty estimates.  
9. The presented findings establish a foundation for practical deployment and ongoing feedback within the water management community to aid complex water resource decisions. <div>
arXiv:2511.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

<div> Keywords: EEG representation learning, device-agnostic, noise robustness, location-based channel embedding, dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation<br><br>Summary:  
The paper presents EEG-X, a foundation model designed for robust and generalizable EEG representation learning. It addresses two main challenges in EEG analysis: variability across datasets due to different devices and configurations, and the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG data. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information to improve generalization across domains and tasks, enabling the model to handle varying electrode layouts, channel numbers, and recording lengths. To enhance noise robustness, EEG-X applies a noise-aware masking and reconstruction approach in both raw and latent data spaces. Unlike prior methods that reconstruct noisy raw EEG signals, EEG-X trains on denoised signals derived from artifact removal, thereby focusing on neural activity rather than extraneous noise. Additionally, EEG-X incorporates a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that maps signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction loss, effectively reducing sensitivity to noise while capturing frequency- and shape-based similarities. Experimental results across multiple EEG datasets from diverse devices demonstrate EEG-X’s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in multiple downstream tasks. Significantly, it excels in cross-domain scenarios with differing electrode layouts between pre-training and downstream datasets. The code and models are publicly available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs) as a technique to improve upon the limitations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) in capturing information in low-variance directions and ensuring stability in low-sample regimes. CSTs are deep untrained networks that apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to input data, producing hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. The filters, termed covariance wavelets, capture specific covariance spectral patterns. CSTs offer improved computational and memory efficiency through a pruning mechanism and exhibit enhanced stability in finite-sample covariance estimations compared to PCA. Experimental results on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements demonstrate that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings similar to VNNs but without the need for training, leading to comparable or better predictions compared to more complex learning models. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$\Omega$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\Omega$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\Omega$ drops. Computing $\Omega$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $\Omega$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$\Omega$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Stroke is an urgent cerebrovascular condition where rapid and accurate diagnosis greatly improves patient outcomes. 2. Current automated diagnostic methods often face fairness challenges, leading to unequal performance across different demographic groups such as age, gender, and posture, which may worsen healthcare disparities. 3.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

<div> Keywords: Offline Reinforcement Learning, Diffusion Models, Value Overestimation, Policy Improvement, D4RL Benchmark

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the issue of value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions in offline reinforcement learning, which limits policy performance. It proposes DIVO (DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization), a novel method that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, in-distribution state-action samples, thereby improving policy learning efficiency. DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism using advantage values from the offline dataset to guide the diffusion model's training; this selectively expands the action space towards higher-advantage regions while maintaining alignment with the original dataset distribution. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters actions with high return potential from the diffusion model, balancing conservatism and explorability in policy optimization. The approach is evaluated on the D4RL benchmark, showing significant performance gains in locomotion tasks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in the challenging AntMaze environment, which features sparse rewards. Overall, DIVO demonstrates an effective way to reduce over-conservatism and improve policy expressiveness and efficiency in offline RL through value-conditional diffusion modeling. <div>

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a framework designed for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on tabular data. QIBONN addresses the challenges of large non-convex search spaces and costly exhaustive tuning by utilizing a qubit-based representation that encompasses feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization. It combines deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation within a fixed evaluation budget. Experiments conducted under single-qubit bit-flip noise show that QIBONN is competitive with established methods such as classical tree-based methods and both classical and quantum-inspired HPO algorithms when considering the same tuning budget. <div>

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

<div> backdoor attacks, machine learning models, defense methods, optimization problem, perturbations
Summary: 
This article introduces a novel method for defending against backdoor attacks in machine learning models. Backdoor attacks are a serious threat as they cause models to misclassify poisoned data while behaving normally on clean data. Existing defenses struggle to accurately identify backdoor neurons. The proposed method focuses on accurately reconstructing Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) values in the latent representation. By formulating the minimal perturbation needed to force clean data into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, accurate TAC values can be obtained. The poisoned class is identified by detecting small perturbation norms, and this information is used in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experimental results on various datasets and architectures show that this approach outperforms existing defense methods, achieving superior backdoor suppression while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Summary:
Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE) is introduced as a framework for precise uncertainty estimation in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) by employing a structured Laplace approximation. This method enhances calibrated uncertainty estimation without altering the original training process or adding new parameters, focusing on the existing expert pathways in Mixture-of-Experts models. Bayesian-MoE utilizes the modular design of MoE models for manageable block-wise posterior estimation and employs Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature. Through experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE, Bayesian-MoE showcases improved expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baseline approaches, affirming its efficacy in facilitating dependable downstream decision-making.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Summary:<br>
Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture efficiently increases model capacity without added inference costs. However, existing models use auxiliary losses and parameters for expert diversity without directly aligning objectives. This work formulates token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem with balancing constraints, improving SMoE performance without extra balancing losses by deriving gating scores from the transport map. Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR) is proposed as a routing mechanism that enhances token assignments and expert selection, replacing auxiliary losses with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and better robustness to input corruption in language modeling and image classification tasks.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Summary: Randomized controlled trials are crucial for validating medical AI tools but are costly and time-consuming. The BRIDGE design proposes reusing data from previous AI trials when old and updated models show similar predictions, reducing the need for new trials. A checklist helps assess data reuse validity. Real-world datasets across various conditions show high concordance between AI models. Simulation studies on breast cancer screening demonstrate a 46.6% reduction in enrollment requirements and cost savings while maintaining statistical power. This adaptive trial design allows for more efficient and cost-effective validation of AI models, accelerating their integration into clinical practice. <div>

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

<div> Clustering, p-Fréchet map, SPD matrices, manifold learning, dimensionality reduction

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper introduces a novel and efficient framework for clustering data that lie on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds, addressing the computational difficulties of standard intrinsic methods. The main innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map, which is a function that embeds data from a generic metric space or manifold $\mathcal{M}$ into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a carefully selected set of reference points. This embedding enables the application of conventional Euclidean clustering algorithms such as k-means, which are computationally more efficient and simpler to implement than intrinsic manifold-based techniques. The authors rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of this $p$-Fréchet map both in Euclidean settings and in the particularly challenging manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data, the proposed method demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving runtime reductions of up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic approaches. Importantly, these efficiency gains do not compromise clustering accuracy; the method maintains high-quality results even in difficult scenarios where existing alternatives struggle or fail, highlighting its robustness and practical relevance for manifold data clustering problems. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fr\'{e}chet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Summary:<br>
Federated learning (FL) has become popular due to its ability to protect data privacy and leverage computational infrastructure. However, data distribution differences can impact its reliability in real-world scenarios. A proposed solution, FedSDWC, integrates invariant and variant features to infer causal semantic representations, enhancing FL's generalization capabilities and outperforming existing methods like FedICON. The method overcomes limitations by modeling weak causal influence between features, establishing a theoretical error bound and relationship with client prior distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show FedSDWC's superiority in handling covariate and semantic shifts, surpassing FedICON by 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.<br> <div>

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI.

<div> Keywords: Graph neural networks, text--attributed graphs, semantic drift, manifold structure, Geodesic Aggregation

Summary: 
This paper discusses the issue of semantic drift in graph neural networks operating on text--attributed graphs. Traditional linear aggregation methods distort the geometrically structured representation spaces of modern pretrained language models, leading to semantic drift where aggregated representations deviate from their intrinsic manifold. To address this problem, the authors introduce a novel metric to measure semantic drift and propose Geodesic Aggregation, a mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics on the unit sphere to maintain fidelity to the semantic manifold. They present GeoGNN, an implementation of this approach that integrates spherical attention and manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoGNN effectively mitigates semantic drift and outperforms existing methods in text--attributed graph learning tasks. The results emphasize the importance of manifold--aware aggregation for preserving semantic information in graph neural networks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach to Interactive Preference Elicitation (IPE) using Dueling Bandit (DB) algorithms. These algorithms aim to optimize decision-making in IPE by making pairwise comparisons. The current challenge with DB algorithms is sparse human feedback. Traditional methods rely heavily on parametric reward models, which can be limited by assumptions and misspecifications. This article proposes an alternative approach based on feedback augmentation. By introducing augmented confidence bounds and incorporating augmented human feedback, the model-free DB framework is enhanced. The algorithm shows competitive performance in various IPE benchmarks, such as recommendation systems and response optimization for large language models. Through regret analysis, the multi-factored performance trade-off is analyzed, demonstrating the potential efficiency of the proposed approach in a wide range of applications. <div>

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel projection method to ensure the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While PINNs use a soft constraint to enforce partial differential equations (PDEs) structure, this can lead to violations of physical laws in the discovered solution. The projection method guarantees the conservation of linear and quadratic integrals separately and jointly by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems. The introduced method, called PINN-Proj, significantly reduces the error in conservation of quantities and marginally decreases the PDE solution error. Evidence suggests that the projection enhances convergence by improving the loss landscape conditioning. This approach offers a general framework to ensure the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a feasible solution exists.

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Summary:  
- Categorical attributes pose challenges in cluster analysis due to lack of defined relationships between attribute values.  
- Existing distance metrics assume fixed topological relationships, limiting adaptability to different cluster structures.  
- This paper introduces a method to learn customizable distance metrics for improved clustering performance.  
- The learned category relationships enhance algorithm fit and are compatible with Euclidean distance metrics.

arXiv:2511.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Summary:
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been used for data annotation but face issues with low-quality labels and lack of error correction mechanisms. To address this, Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs) are introduced to efficiently correct VLM-generated noisy labels. HCL strategically involves human correction only for instances with discrepancies, leading to higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. A risk-consistent estimator is theoretically derived to incorporate human-corrected labels and VLM predictions for classifier training. Additionally, a conditional probability method is proposed to estimate label distribution using VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments show that the approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, demonstrating the effectiveness of HCL in weak supervision scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

- Learning a reordering network is proposed to minimize the \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors to approximate fill-ins.
- A graph encoder is used to predict row or column node scores for reordering.

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

<div> Keywords: large language models, data poisoning, RLHF, label flipping, convex optimization<br><br>Summary: This paper investigates vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) during the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) alignment processes, focusing on data poisoning attacks. Specifically, it studies the minimal-cost poisoning attacks achievable by flipping preference labels without altering the textual outputs compared during alignment. The authors formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem constrained linearly and derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost required to steer the LLM’s policy toward an attacker-specified target. They also introduce a post-processing method that optimizes existing label-flipping attacks by reducing the number of flipped labels necessary while maintaining the attack’s effectiveness. Empirical evaluations reveal that this cost-minimization approach significantly lowers poisoning costs compared to baseline methods, especially when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These theoretical and empirical insights expose fundamental weaknesses in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide practical tools to assess the robustness of LLM training against low-cost label flipping attacks, emphasizing a need for more secure alignment methodologies. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, cyber defence, graph neural networks, generalisability, Proximal Policy Optimisation<br><br>Summary:<br><br>This paper addresses the challenge of adapting deep reinforcement learning agents to defend computer networks with varying topology and size without retraining. The authors introduce Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA), which leverage heterogeneous graph neural network layers to create fixed-size latent embeddings representing network states. This fixed-size representation enhances the agent’s ability to generalize across different network configurations. Additionally, TERLA incorporates a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful, and interpretable action space to improve action efficiency. The approach is applied to the standard Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) reinforcement learning model and evaluated within the Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4 environment, which simulates realistic network conditions including Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple defending agents. Results show that TERLA agents maintain comparable defensive performance to vanilla PPO agents while achieving higher action efficiency. Moreover, the generalisability of TERLA agents is confirmed by deploying a single agent multiple times to defend networks with different sizes and topologies, where it consistently demonstrates better defensive performance and efficiency. These contributions suggest TERLA offers a scalable and practical solution for autonomous cyber defence in dynamic real-world networks. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\'ern, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<title>Enabling Agents to Communicate Entirely in Latent Space</title>

<div> Keywords: latent communication, large language models, multi-agent systems, compression, chain-of-thought prompting  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses a fundamental limitation in communication between large language model (LLM)-based agents, which traditionally rely on natural language to transmit information. Natural language restricts the depth and nuance of the rich internal latent states of LLMs, hindering effective collaborative problem-solving. To overcome this, the authors propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a novel paradigm that enables direct transmission of the LLMs’ last hidden states, conceptualized as a representation of the agent's "mind." Interlat also introduces an additional latent space compression mechanism that further reduces communication overhead through end-to-end latent reasoning, preserving essential information. Experimental evaluation shows that Interlat significantly outperforms fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques and single-agent baselines by fostering more exploratory behavior and effectively utilizing latent internal data. Moreover, the compression step not only accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance, validating the approach’s efficiency. This work serves as a feasibility study for fully latent space-based inter-agent communication, highlighting promising directions for future research in communication protocols among LLM agents and advancing multi-agent collaboration beyond natural language constraints. <div>

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

<title>Unsupervised Feature Selection Through Group Discovery</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

<title>Compact Memory for Continual Logistic Regression</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

<title>Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173</link>

arXiv:2511.09173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

<title>FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180</link>

arXiv:2511.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs. The source code is available at https://github.com/AwesomeLemon/IPBT.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a stochastic version of the mean-shift clustering algorithm. In this stochastic version a randomly chosen sequence of data points move according to partial gradient ascent steps of the objective function. Theoretical results illustrating the convergence of the proposed approach, and its relative performances is evaluated on synthesized 2-dimensional samples generated by a Gaussian mixture distribution and compared with state-of-the-art methods. It can be observed that in most cases the stochastic mean-shift clustering outperforms the standard mean-shift. We also illustrate as a practical application the use of the presented method for speaker clustering.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers. Our code is available at https://github.com/happypu326/CoCo-MILP.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&amp;B). A key driver influencing B&amp;B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&amp;B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&amp;B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&amp;B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

<title>Mixture-of-Channels: Exploiting Sparse FFNs for Efficient LLMs Pre-Training and Inference</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Abstract: GAMMA_FLOW is an open-source Python package for real-time analysis of spectral data. It supports classification, denoising, decomposition, and outlier detection of both single- and multi-component spectra. Instead of relying on large, computationally intensive models, it employs a supervised approach to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for dimensionality reduction. This ensures a fast, efficient, and adaptable analysis while reducing computational costs. gamma_flow achieves classification accuracies above 90% and enables reliable automated spectral interpretation. Originally developed for gamma-ray spectra, it is applicable to any type of one-dimensional spectral data. As an open and flexible alternative to proprietary software, it supports various applications in research and industry.

<title>Distribution-Based Feature Attribution for Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>From Decision Trees to Boolean Logic: A Fast and Unified SHAP Algorithm</title>

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

arXiv:2511.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

<title>Potent but Stealthy: Rethink Profile Pollution against Sequential Recommendation via Bi-level Constrained Reinforcement Paradigm</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09392</link>

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

arXiv:2511.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

arXiv:2511.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

arXiv:2511.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

<title>PDAC: Efficient Coreset Selection for Continual Learning via Probability Density Awareness</title>

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

<title>AutoSynth: Automated Workflow Optimization for High-Quality Synthetic Dataset Generation via Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

<title>Quasi-Newton Compatible Actor-Critic for Deterministic Policies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2511.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

<title>GenePheno: Interpretable Gene Knockout-Induced Phenotype Abnormality Prediction from Gene Sequences</title>

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

<title>SiDGen: Structure-informed Diffusion for Generative modeling of Ligands for Proteins</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09529</link>

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

arXiv:2511.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.

Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbar\Omega$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.

Abstract: We present the first application of federated learning (FL) to the U.S. National Financial Capability Study, introducing an interpretable framework for predicting consumer financial distress across all 50 states and the District of Columbia without centralizing sensitive data. Our cross-silo FL setup treats each state as a distinct data silo, simulating real-world governance in nationwide financial systems. Unlike prior work, our approach integrates two complementary explainable AI techniques to identify both global (nationwide) and local (state-specific) predictors of financial hardship, such as contact from debt collection agencies. We develop a machine learning model specifically suited for highly categorical, imbalanced survey data. This work delivers a scalable, regulation-compliant blueprint for early warning systems in finance, demonstrating how FL can power socially responsible AI applications in consumer credit risk and financial inclusion.

<title>GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590</link>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&amp;ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

Abstract: The large-scale integration of renewable energy and power electronic devices has increased the complexity of power system stability, making transient stability assessment more challenging. Conventional methods are limited in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MoE-GraphSAGE, a graph neural network framework based on the MoE for unified TAS and TVS assessment. The framework leverages GraphSAGE to capture the power grid's spatiotemporal topological features and employs multi-expert networks with a gating mechanism to model distinct instability modes jointly. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that MoE-GraphSAGE achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering an effective solution for online multi-task transient stability assessment in complex power systems.

Abstract: Typical lunar landing missions involve multiple phases of braking to achieve soft-landing. The propulsion system configuration for these missions consists of throttleable engines. This configuration involves complex interconnected hydraulic, mechanical, and pneumatic components each exhibiting non-linear dynamic characteristics. Accurate modelling of the propulsion dynamics is essential for analyzing closed-loop guidance and control schemes during descent. This paper presents a learning-based system identification approach for modelling of throttleable engine dynamics using data obtained from high-fidelity propulsion model. The developed model is validated with experimental results and used for closed-loop guidance and control simulations.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have been used to produce interpretable stock forecasts, they mainly focus on analyzing textual reports but not historical price data, also known as Technical Analysis. This task is challenging as it switches between domains: the stock price inputs and outputs lie in the time-series domain, while the reasoning step should be in natural language. In this work, we introduce Verbal Technical Analysis (VTA), a novel framework that combine verbal and latent reasoning to produce stock time-series forecasts that are both accurate and interpretable. To reason over time-series, we convert stock price data into textual annotations and optimize the reasoning trace using an inverse Mean Squared Error (MSE) reward objective. To produce time-series outputs from textual reasoning, we condition the outputs of a time-series backbone model on the reasoning-based attributes. Experiments on stock datasets across U.S., Chinese, and European markets show that VTA achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, while the reasoning traces also perform well on evaluation by industry experts.

<title>Learn More, Forget Less: A Gradient-Aware Data Selection Approach for LLM</title>

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is important in finance domain. Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF). However, current TSF models either use only single-period input, or lack customized designs for addressing multi-period characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/MLF.

While neural operators offer efficient alternatives, they often struggle to achieve high-resolution numerical accuracy in these systems. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent spatial heterogeneity and the scarcity of high-quality training data in multiphase flows. In this work, we propose the Interface Information-Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel framework that explicitly leverages interface information as a physical prior to enhance the prediction accuracy. The IANO architecture introduces two key components: 1) An interface-aware multiple function encoding mechanism jointly models multiple physical fields and interfaces, thus capturing the high-frequency physical features at the interface. 2) A geometry-aware positional encoding mechanism further establishes the relationship between interface information, physical variables, and spatial positions, enabling it to achieve pointwise super-resolution prediction even in the low-data regimes. Experimental results demonstrate that IANO outperforms baselines by $\sim$10\% in accuracy for multiphase flow simulations while maintaining robustness under data-scarce and noise-perturbed conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable machine learning framework to help identify trade data discrepancies that are challenging to detect with traditional methods. Our system analyzes trade data to find a novel inverse price-volume signature, a pattern where reported volumes increase as average unit prices decrease.
  The model achieves 0.9375 accuracy and was validated by comparing large-scale UN data with detailed firm-level data, confirming that the risk signatures are consistent. This scalable tool provides customs authorities with a transparent, data-driven method to shift from conventional to priority-based inspection protocols, translating complex data into actionable intelligence to support international environmental policies.

Abstract: Large Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have demonstrated success in various domains, including general text and image generation, drug discovery, and protein-RNA (ribonucleic acid) binding tasks. However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.

Abstract: We investigate a number of Artificial Neural Network architectures (well-known and more ``exotic'') in application to the long-term financial time-series forecasts of indexes on different global markets. The particular area of interest of this research is to examine the correlation of these indexes' behaviour in terms of Machine Learning algorithms cross-training. Would training an algorithm on an index from one global market produce similar or even better accuracy when such a model is applied for predicting another index from a different market? The demonstrated predominately positive answer to this question is another argument in favour of the long-debated Efficient Market Hypothesis of Eugene Fama.

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

Abstract: Industrial Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) often comprise hundreds of thousands to millions of nets and millions to tens of millions of connectivity edges, making empirical evaluation of hardware-Trojan (HT) detectors on realistic designs both necessary and difficult. Public benchmarks remain significantly smaller and hand-crafted, while releasing truly malicious RTL raises ethical and operational risks. This work presents an automated and scalable methodology for generating HT-like patterns in industry-scale netlists whose purpose is to stress-test detection tools without altering user-visible functionality. The pipeline (i) parses large gate-level designs into connectivity graphs, (ii) explores rare regions using SCOAP testability metrics, and (iii) applies parameterized, function-preserving graph transformations to synthesize trigger-payload pairs that mimic the statistical footprint of stealthy HTs. When evaluated on the benchmarks generated in this work, representative state-of-the-art graph-learning models fail to detect Trojans. The framework closes the evaluation gap between academic circuits and modern SoCs by providing reproducible challenge instances that advance security research without sharing step-by-step attack instructions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Error estimates and convergence are provided. In contrast to the existing literature, our approach not only analyzes the non-Markovian framework but also addresses fully coupled settings, in which both the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward process may be random and depend on the backward components $Y$ and $Z$. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical applicability of our framework by addressing utility maximization problems under rough volatility, which are solved numerically with the proposed deep learning-based methods.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

Abstract: Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural preconditioned Newton (NP-Newton) method for solving parametric nonlinear systems of equations. To overcome the stagnation or instability of Newton iterations caused by unbalanced nonlinearities, we introduce a fixed-point neural operator (FPNO) that learns the direct mapping from the current iterate to the solution by emulating fixed-point iterations. Unlike traditional line-search or trust-region algorithms, the proposed FPNO adaptively employs negative step sizes to effectively mitigate the effects of unbalanced nonlinearities. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the proposed NP-Newton method across multiple real-world applications, especially for very strong nonlinearities.

Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based beam weighting framework that couples a policy network with an augmented weighted least squares (WLS) estimator for accurate and low-complexity positioning in multi-beam LEO constellations. Unlike conventional geometry or CSI-dependent approaches, the policy learns directly from uplink pilot responses and geometry features, enabling robust localization without explicit CSI estimation. An augmented WLS jointly estimates position and receiver clock bias, improving numerical stability under dynamic beam geometry. Across representative scenarios, the proposed method reduces the mean positioning error by 99.3% compared with the geometry-based baseline, achieving 0.395 m RMSE with near real-time inference.

Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&amp;E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

<title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Ensemble Non-Attention</title>

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

Abstract: Model watermarking techniques can embed watermark information into the protected model for ownership declaration by constructing specific input-output pairs. However, existing watermarks are easily removed when facing model stealing attacks, and make it difficult for model owners to effectively verify the copyright of stolen models. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of the failure of current watermarking methods under model stealing scenarios and then explore potential solutions. Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality. Furthermore, we propose an effective watermark samples filtering mechanism that elaborately select watermark key samples used in model ownership verification to enhance the reliability of watermarks. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in defending against various model stealing attacks, as well as watermark attacks, and achieves new state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

<title>Generalisable prediction model of surgical case duration: multicentre development and temporal validation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08994</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Background: Accurate prediction of surgical case duration underpins operating room (OR) scheduling, yet existing models often depend on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and rarely undergo external validation, limiting generalisability.
  Methods: We undertook a retrospective multicentre study using routinely collected perioperative data from two general hospitals in Japan (development: 1 January 2021-31 December 2023; temporal test: 1 January-31 December 2024). Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.
  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).
  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time. Such general-purpose tools may improve OR scheduling without relying on idiosyncratic inputs.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.

Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revealed numerous non-coding short variants whose functional impacts remain poorly understood. Despite recent advances in deep-learning genomic approaches, accurately predicting and prioritizing clinically relevant mutations in gene regulatory regions remains a major challenge. Here we introduce Deep VRegulome, a deep-learning method for prediction and interpretation of functionally disruptive variants in the human regulome, which combines 700 DNABERT fine-tuned models, trained on vast amounts of ENCODE gene regulatory regions, with variant scoring, motif analysis, attention-based visualization, and survival analysis. We showcase its application on TCGA glioblastoma WGS dataset in prioritizing survival-associated mutations and regulatory regions. The analysis identified 572 splice-disrupting and 9,837 transcription-factor binding site altering mutations occurring in greater than 10% of glioblastoma samples. Survival analysis linked 1352 mutations and 563 disrupted regulatory regions to patient outcomes, enabling stratification via non-coding mutation signatures. All the code, fine-tuned models, and an interactive data portal are publicly available.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Embedding deep neural networks (NNs) into mixed-integer programs (MIPs) is attractive for decision making with learned constraints, yet state-of-the-art monolithic linearisations blow up in size and quickly become intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-decomposition framework that relaxes the single coupling equality u=x with an augmented Lagrange multiplier and splits the problem into a vanilla MIP and a constrained NN block. Each part is tackled by the solver that suits it best-branch and cut for the MIP subproblem, first-order optimisation for the NN subproblem-so the model remains modular, the number of integer variables never grows with network depth, and the per-iteration cost scales only linearly with the NN size. On the public \textsc{SurrogateLIB} benchmark, our method proves \textbf{scalable}, \textbf{modular}, and \textbf{adaptable}: it runs \(120\times\) faster than an exact Big-M formulation on the largest test case; the NN sub-solver can be swapped from a log-barrier interior step to a projected-gradient routine with no code changes and identical objective value; and swapping the MLP for an LSTM backbone still completes the full optimisation in 47s without any bespoke adaptation.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

Abstract: The paper studies a geometrically robust least-squares problem that extends classical and norm-based robust formulations. Rather than minimizing residual error for fixed or perturbed data, we interpret least-squares as enforcing approximate subspace inclusion between measured and true data spaces. The uncertainty in this geometric relation is modeled as a metric ball on the Grassmannian manifold, leading to a min-max problem over Euclidean and manifold variables. The inner maximization admits a closed-form solution, enabling an efficient algorithm with a transparent geometric interpretation. Applied to robust finite-horizon linear-quadratic tracking in data-enabled predictive control, the method improves upon existing robust least-squares formulations, achieving stronger robustness and favorable scaling under small uncertainty.

<title>From Model Training to Model Raising - A call to reform AI model training paradigms from post-hoc alignment to intrinsic, identity-based development</title>

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.

<title>MCAD: Multimodal Context-Aware Audio Description Generation For Soccer</title>

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

<title>Distributional Shrinkage I: Universal Denoisers in Multi-Dimensions</title>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \sigma Z$, where $\sigma \in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\sigma^4)$ and $O(\sigma^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \sigma^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{\sigma^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, distributed inference has become increasingly important. Model-parallel strategies must now efficiently scale not only across multiple GPUs but also across multiple nodes. In this work, we present a detailed performance study of multi-node distributed inference using LLMs on GPU-based supercomputers. We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

Abstract: Reaction prediction, a critical task in synthetic chemistry, is to predict the outcome of a reaction based on given reactants. Generative models like Transformer have typically been employed to predict the reaction product. However, these likelihood-maximization models overlooked the inherent stochastic nature of chemical reactions, such as the multiple ways electrons can be redistributed among atoms during the reaction process. In scenarios where similar reactants could follow different electron redistribution patterns, these models typically predict the most common outcomes, neglecting less frequent but potentially crucial reaction patterns. These overlooked patterns, though rare, can lead to innovative methods for designing synthetic routes and significantly advance synthesis techniques. To address these limitations, we build a team of expert models to capture diverse plausible reaction outcomes for the same reactants, mimicking the divergent thinking of chemists. The proposed framework, ReactionTeam, is composed of specialized expert models, each trained to capture a distinct type of electron redistribution pattern in reaction, and a ranking expert that evaluates and orders the generated predictions. Experimental results across two widely used datasets and different data settings demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significantly better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) model, a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation by introducing key modifications specific to EHR data: a) attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) domain-informed temporal decay to mimic clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrates CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art architectures in data restoration and downstream tasks. CSAI is integrated into PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.

Abstract: Learning from human feedback plays an important role in aligning generative models, such as large language models (LLM). However, the effectiveness of this approach can be influenced by adversaries, who may intentionally provide misleading preferences to manipulate the output in an undesirable or harmful direction. To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this problem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm, namely robust contextual dueling bandits, which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/\kappa+dC/\kappa)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, $\kappa$ is the lower bound of the derivative of the link function, and $ 0 \le C \le T$ is the total number of adversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$) adversarial feedback. Our work is the first to achieve nearly minimax optimal regret for dueling bandits in the presence of adversarial preference feedback. Additionally, for the sigmoid link function, we develop a novel algorithm that takes into account the effect of local derivatives in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) analysis through a refined method for estimating the link function's derivative. This method helps us to eliminate the $\kappa$ dependence in the leading term with respect to $T$, which reduces the exponential dependence on the parameter radius $B$ to a polynomial dependence. We conduct experiments to evaluate our proposed algorithm against various types of adversarial feedback. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms in the presence of adversarial feedback.

Abstract: Reuse of data in adaptive workflows poses challenges regarding overfitting and the statistical validity of results. Previous work has demonstrated that interacting with data via differentially private algorithms can mitigate overfitting, achieving worst-case generalization guarantees with asymptotically optimal data requirements. However, such past work assumes data is static and cannot accommodate situations where data grows over time. In this paper we address this gap, presenting the first generalization bounds for adaptive analysis on dynamic data. We allow the analyst to adaptively schedule their queries conditioned on the current size of the data, in addition to previous queries and responses. We also incorporate time-varying empirical accuracy bounds and mechanisms, allowing for tighter guarantees as data accumulates. In a batched query setting, the asymptotic data requirements of our bound grows with the square-root of the number of adaptive queries, matching prior works' improvement over data splitting for the static setting. We instantiate our bound for statistical queries with the clipped Gaussian mechanism, where it empirically outperforms baselines composed from static bounds.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from trained models, addressing privacy concerns and ensuring compliance with regulations such as the ``right to be forgotten.'' Evaluating strong unlearning, where the unlearned model is indistinguishable from one retrained without the forgetting data, remains a significant challenge in deep neural networks (DNNs). Common black-box metrics, such as variants of membership inference attacks and accuracy comparisons, primarily assess model outputs but often fail to capture residual information in intermediate layers. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Information Difference Index (IDI), a novel white-box metric inspired by information theory. IDI quantifies retained information in intermediate features by measuring mutual information between those features and the labels to be forgotten, offering a more comprehensive assessment of unlearning efficacy. Our experiments demonstrate that IDI effectively measures the degree of unlearning across various datasets and architectures, providing a reliable tool for evaluating strong unlearning in DNNs.

Abstract: As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.

Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).

Abstract: Causal learning from data has received much attention recently. Bayesian networks can be used to capture causal relationships. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model. This formalism is utilized in the present contribution to propose a score-based learning algorithm. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 80 time series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bioscience and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the importance of developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle instances of modest size.

Abstract: Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning verifiably Lyapunov-stable neural controllers that provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction (ROA). Unlike previous works that adopted counterexample-guided training without considering the computation of verification in training, we introduce Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound (CT-BaB), a new certified training framework that optimizes certified bounds, thereby reducing the discrepancy between training and test-time verification that also computes certified bounds. To achieve a relatively global guarantee on an entire input region-of-interest, we propose a training-time BaB technique that maintains a dynamic training dataset and adaptively splits hard input subregions into smaller ones, to tighten certified bounds and ease the training. Meanwhile, subregions created by the training-time BaB also inform test-time verification, for a more efficient training-aware verification. We demonstrate that CT-BaB yields verification-friendly models that can be more efficiently verified at test time while achieving stronger verifiable guarantees with larger ROA. On the largest output-feedback 2D Quadrotor system experimented, CT-BaB reduces verification time by over 11X relative to the previous state-of-the-art baseline while achieving 164X larger ROA.

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-constrained neural differential equation framework for parameterization, and employs it to model the time evolution of seasonal snow depth given hydrometeorological forcings. When trained on data from multiple SNOTEL sites, the parameterization predicts daily snow depth with under 9% median error and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies over 0.94 across a wide variety of snow climates. The parameterization also generalizes to new sites not seen during training, which is not often true for calibrated snow models. Requiring the parameterization to predict snow water equivalent in addition to snow depth only increases error to ~12%. The structure of the approach guarantees the satisfaction of physical constraints, enables these constraints during model training, and allows modeling at different temporal resolutions without additional retraining of the parameterization. These benefits hold potential in climate modeling, and could extend to other dynamical systems with physical constraints.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to transfer knowledge or information from a source domain to a relevant target domain. In this paper, we understand transfer learning from the perspectives of knowledge transferability and trustworthiness. This involves two research questions: How is knowledge transferability quantitatively measured and enhanced across domains? Can we trust the transferred knowledge in the transfer learning process? To answer these questions, this paper provides a comprehensive review of trustworthy transfer learning from various aspects, including problem definitions, theoretical analysis, empirical algorithms, and real-world applications. Specifically, we summarize recent theories and algorithms for understanding knowledge transferability under (within-domain) IID and non-IID assumptions. In addition to knowledge transferability, we review the impact of trustworthiness on transfer learning, e.g., whether the transferred knowledge is adversarially robust or algorithmically fair, how to transfer the knowledge under privacy-preserving constraints, etc. Beyond discussing the current advancements, we highlight the open questions and future directions for understanding transfer learning in a reliable and trustworthy manner.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in graph machine learning (GML), with its applications spanning numerous domains. However, the focus of GML has predominantly been on developing powerful models, often overlooking a crucial initial step: constructing suitable graphs from common data formats, such as tabular data. This construction process is fundamental to applying graph-based models, yet it remains largely understudied and lacks formalization. Our research aims to address this gap by formalizing the graph construction problem and proposing an effective solution. We identify two critical challenges to achieve this goal: 1. The absence of dedicated datasets to formalize and evaluate the effectiveness of graph construction methods, and 2. Existing automatic construction methods can only be applied to some specific cases, while tedious human engineering is required to generate high-quality graphs. To tackle these challenges, we present a two-fold contribution. First, we introduce a set of datasets to formalize and evaluate graph construction methods. Second, we propose an LLM-based solution, AutoG, automatically generating high-quality graph schemas without human intervention. The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of constructed graphs is critical to downstream task performance, and AutoG can generate high-quality graphs that rival those produced by human experts. Our code can be accessible from https://github.com/amazon-science/Automatic-Table-to-Graph-Generation.

Abstract: With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for Thompson sampling (TS) contextual bandit algorithms, in which the algorithm's ability to quantify uncertainty and make decisions depends on the quality of a generative model that is learned offline. Instead of viewing uncertainty in the environment as arising from unobservable latent parameters, our algorithm treats uncertainty as stemming from missing, but potentially observable outcomes (including both future and counterfactual outcomes). If these outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an "oracle" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of TS and establish a state-of-the-art regret bound. Notably, our regret bound depends on the generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and applies to any method of fitting the "oracle" policy.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress in graph-based learning tasks, yet their performance often deteriorates when facing heterophilous structures where connected nodes differ substantially in features and labels. To address this limitation, we propose GNNMoE, a novel entropy-driven mixture of message-passing experts framework that enables node-level adaptive representation learning. GNNMoE decomposes message passing into propagation and transformation operations and integrates them through multiple expert networks guided by a hybrid routing mechanism. And a routing entropy regularization dynamically adjusts soft weighting and soft top-$k$ routing, allowing GNNMoE to flexibly adapt to diverse neighborhood contexts. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNNMoE consistently outperforms SOTA node classification methods, while maintaining scalability and interpretability. This work provides a unified and principled approach for achieving fine-grained, personalized node representation learning.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis, organizing data into a tree of clusterings from which a partition can be chosen. This paper generalizes these ideas by proving that, for any reasonable hierarchy, one can optimally solve any center-based clustering objective over it (such as $k$-means). Moreover, these solutions can be found exceedingly quickly and are themselves necessarily hierarchical. Thus, given a cluster tree, we show that one can quickly access a plethora of new, equally meaningful hierarchies. Just as in standard hierarchical clustering, one can then choose any desired partition from these new hierarchies. We conclude by verifying the utility of our proposed techniques across datasets, hierarchies, and partitioning schemes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent methods for auditing the privacy of machine learning algorithms have improved computational efficiency by simultaneously intervening on multiple training examples in a single training run. Steinke et al. (2024) prove that one-run auditing indeed lower bounds the true privacy parameter of the audited algorithm, and give impressive empirical results. Their work leaves open the question of how precisely one-run auditing can uncover the true privacy parameter of an algorithm, and how that precision depends on the audited algorithm. In this work, we characterize the maximum achievable efficacy of one-run auditing and show that the key barrier to its efficacy is interference between the observable effects of different data elements. We present new conceptual approaches to minimize this barrier, towards improving the performance of one-run auditing of real machine learning algorithms.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models for exploring chemical space have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data, and offers strong performance in both forward and bottom-up synthesis planning compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for discovery.

Abstract: How should we evaluate the quality of generative models? Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical decomposition for quantifying steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in user studies of text-to-image and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerability. These results suggest that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: simple image-based steering mechanisms achieve more than 2x improvement on this benchmark.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.

Abstract: Fairness studies of algorithmic decision-making systems often simplify complex decision processes, such as bail or loan approvals, into binary classification tasks. However, these approaches overlook that such decisions are not inherently binary (e.g., approve or not approve bail or loan); they also involve non-binary treatment decisions (e.g., bail conditions or loan terms) that can influence the downstream outcomes (e.g., loan repayment or reoffending). In this paper, we argue that non-binary treatment decisions are integral to the decision process and controlled by decision-makers and, therefore, should be central to fairness analyses in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a causal framework that extends fairness analyses and explicitly distinguishes between decision-subjects' covariates and the treatment decisions. This specification allows decision-makers to use our framework to (i) measure treatment disparity and its downstream effects in historical data and, using counterfactual reasoning, (ii) mitigate the impact of past unfair treatment decisions when automating decision-making. We use our framework to empirically analyze four widely used loan approval datasets to reveal potential disparity in non-binary treatment decisions and their discriminatory impact on outcomes, highlighting the need to incorporate treatment decisions in fairness assessments. Moreover, by intervening in treatment decisions, we show that our framework effectively mitigates treatment discrimination from historical data to ensure fair risk score estimation and (non-binary) decision-making processes that benefit all stakeholders.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) enable to empirically assess the privacy of a machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose TAMIS, a novel MIA against differentially-private synthetic data generation methods that rely on graphical models. This attack builds upon MAMA-MIA, a recently-published state-of-the-art method. It lowers its computational cost and requires less attacker knowledge. Our attack is the product of a two-fold improvement. First, we recover the graphical model having generated a synthetic dataset by using solely that dataset, rather than shadow-modeling over an auxiliary one. This proves less costly and more performant. Second, we introduce a more mathematically-grounded attack score, that provides a natural threshold for binary predictions. In our experiments, TAMIS achieves better or similar performance as MAMA-MIA on replicas of the SNAKE challenge.

Abstract: Are traditional classification approaches irrelevant in this era of AI hype? We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.

Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable language processing and reasoning ability but are prone to hallucinate when asked about private data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q&amp;As on large text-attributed KGs.

Abstract: Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.

Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering potential algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.

Abstract: Missing values in high-dimensional, mixed-type datasets pose significant challenges for data imputation, particularly under Missing Not At Random (MNAR) mechanisms. Existing methods struggle to integrate local and global data characteristics, limiting performance in MNAR and high-dimensional settings. We propose an innovative framework, RefiDiff, combining local machine learning predictions with a novel Mamba-based denoising network efficiently capturing long-range dependencies among features and samples with low computational complexity. RefiDiff bridges the predictive and generative paradigms of imputation, leveraging pre-refinement for initial warm-up imputations and post-refinement to polish results, enhancing stability and accuracy. By encoding mixed-type data into unified tokens, RefiDiff enables robust imputation without architectural or hyperparameter tuning. RefiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across missing-value settings, demonstrating strong performance in MNAR settings and superior out-of-sample generalization. Extensive evaluations on nine real-world datasets demonstrate its robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in handling complex missingness patterns.

Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop Selective Head Attention with hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, Qwen, Mistral across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is a fundamental tool for decision-making in a wide range of applications. However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of the optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from contextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a machine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make decisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning (DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce predictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy. While effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving the optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation. In this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization problems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world applications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the geometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with minimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight that a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that is at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope. Building on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth optimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this as loss function. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high decision quality.

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

Abstract: This research endeavors to offer insights into unlocking the further potential of transformer-based architectures. One of the primary motivations is to offer a geometric interpretation for the attention mechanism in transformers. In our framework, the attention mainly involves metric tensors, tangent spaces, inner product, and how they relate to each other. These quantities and structures at discrete positions are intricately interconnected via the parallel transport of tangent vectors. To make the learning process more efficient, we reduce the number of parameters through ingenious predefined configurations. Moreover, we introduce an explicit mechanism to highlight a neighborhood by attenuating the remote values, given that transformers inherently neglect local inductive bias. Experimental results demonstrate that our modules deliver significant performance improvements relative to the baseline. More evaluation experiments on visual and large language models will be launched successively.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations$\unicode{x2013}$insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However, differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations, actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

<title>The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?</title>

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100\% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a tradeoff: mechanistic models provide scientific grounding but struggle with real-world complexity, while machine learning models achieve strong predictive performance but require large labeled datasets and are not interpretable. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), which use mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. Simulation-grounded learning has been applied in multiple domains (e.g., surrogate models in physics, forecasting in epidemiology). We provide a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning and evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks. We found that SGNNs were successful across domains: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one-third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task-specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a form of mechanistic interpretability. Back-to-simulation attribution matches real-world observations to the training simulations the model considers most similar, identifying which mechanistic processes the model believes best explain the observed data. By providing a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning, we establish when and how mechanistic simulations can serve as effective training data for robust, interpretable scientific inference.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual uncertainty modeling (P-DRUM). P-DRUM models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of P-DRUM and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.

<title>Symphony-MoE: Harmonizing Disparate Pre-trained Models into a Coherent Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To mitigate the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder and Qwen2). A key challenge lies in the fact that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment. Subsequently, a stage of post-training coordinates the entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios; hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1. Our framework for evaluating new routers is on https://github.com/RouteWorks/RouterArena

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

<title>Token Hidden Reward: Steering Exploration-Exploitation in Group Relative Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector, the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Abstract: We present a differential-geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) based on jet functors and Weil algebras. In this framework, forward- and reverse-mode differentiation arise naturally as pushforward and cotangent pullback, while higher-order differentiation corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. This construction provides a unified, coordinate-free view of derivative propagation and clarifies the algebraic structure underlying AD. All results are realized in modern JAX code, where the Weil-mode formulation computes all mixed derivatives in a single forward pass with cost linear in the algebra dimension. The resulting implementation achieves algebraically exact and numerically stable differentiation with predictable scaling, demonstrating that geometric abstraction can yield more efficient and transparent computational differentiation systems. Code is available at https://git.nilu.no/geometric-ad/jet-weil-ad

<title>Generalization Bounds for Rank-sparse Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$ quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based bound instead.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic, unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields 65.9% and 62.3% adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively, versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks, including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools; EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%) for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies (index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis; patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still do not achieve the best possible performance when trained with ten thousand training samples, each containing many instances.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations. Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$, $\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50, and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100) confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: In many applications, machine-learned (ML) models are required to hold some invariance qualities, such as rotation, size, and intensity invariance. Among these, testing for background invariance presents a significant challenge due to the vast and complex data space it encompasses. To evaluate invariance qualities, we first use a visualization-based testing framework which allows human analysts to assess and make informed decisions about the invariance properties of ML models. We show that such informative testing framework is preferred as ML models with the same global statistics (e.g., accuracy scores) can behave differently and have different visualized testing patterns. However, such human analysts might not lead to consistent decisions without a systematic sampling approach to select representative testing suites. In this work, we present a technical solution for selecting background scenes according to their semantic proximity to a target image that contains a foreground object being tested. We construct an ontology for storing knowledge about relationships among different objects using association analysis. This ontology enables an efficient and meaningful search for background scenes of different semantic distances to a target image, enabling the selection of a test suite that is both diverse and reasonable. Compared with other testing techniques, e.g., random sampling, nearest neighbors, or other sampled test suites by visual-language models (VLMs), our method achieved a superior balance between diversity and consistency of human annotations, thereby enhancing the reliability and comprehensiveness of background invariance testing.

Abstract: We address the problem of simultaneously estimating arc travel times in a network \emph{and} parameters of route choice models for strategic and tactical network planning purposes. Hitherto, these interdependent tasks have been approached separately in the literature on road traffic networks. We illustrate that ignoring this interdependence can lead to erroneous route choice model parameter estimates. We propose a method for maximum likelihood estimation to solve the simultaneous estimation problem that is applicable to any differentiable route choice model. Moreover, our approach allows to naturally mix observations at varying levels of granularity, including noisy or partial path data. Numerical results based on real taxi data from New York City show strong performance of our method, even in comparison to a benchmark method focused solely on arc travel time estimation.

Abstract: We propose a gradient-free online ensemble learning algorithm that dynamically combines forecasts from a heterogeneous set of machine learning models based on their recent predictive performance, measured by out-of-sample R-squared. The ensemble is model-agnostic, requires no gradient access, and is designed for sequential forecasting under nonstationarity. It adaptively reweights 16 constituent models-three linear benchmarks (OLS, PCR, LASSO) and thirteen nonlinear learners including Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and a hierarchy of neural networks (NN1-NN12). We apply the framework to sector rotation, using sector-level features aggregated from firm characteristics. Empirically, sector returns are more predictable and stable than individual asset returns, making them suitable for cross-sectional forecasting. The algorithm constructs sector-specific ensembles that assign adaptive weights in a rolling-window fashion, guided by forecast accuracy. Our key theoretical result bounds the online forecast regret directly in terms of realized out-of-sample R-squared, providing an interpretable guarantee that the ensemble performs nearly as well as the best model in hindsight. Empirically, the ensemble consistently outperforms individual models, equal-weighted averages, and traditional offline ensembles, delivering higher predictive accuracy, stronger risk-adjusted returns, and robustness across macroeconomic regimes, including during the COVID-19 crisis.

Abstract: A prompt injection attack aims to inject malicious instruction/data into the input of an LLM-Integrated Application such that it produces results as an attacker desires. Existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks are special cases in our framework. Moreover, based on our framework, we design a new attack by combining existing ones. Using our framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation on 5 prompt injection attacks and 10 defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. Our work provides a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defenses. To facilitate research on this topic, we make our platform public at https://github.com/liu00222/Open-Prompt-Injection.

The nuances between the many assumptions and setups are explained. Although there is not much truly new here, some existing tools are applied in novel ways to obtain new algorithms. A few bounds are improved in minor ways.

Abstract: We consider convex optimization with non-smooth objective function and log-concave sampling with non-smooth potential (negative log density). In particular, we study two specific settings where the convex objective/potential function is either H\"older smooth or in hybrid form as the finite sum of H\"older smooth components. To overcome the challenges caused by non-smoothness, our algorithms employ two powerful proximal frameworks in optimization and sampling: the proximal point framework for optimization and the alternating sampling framework (ASF) that uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented distribution. A key component of both optimization and sampling algorithms is the efficient implementation of the proximal map by the regularized cutting-plane method. We establish its iteration-complexity under both H\"older smoothness and hybrid settings using novel convergence analysis, yielding results that are new to the literature. We further propose an adaptive proximal bundle method for non-smooth optimization that employs an aggressive adaptive stepsize strategy, which adjusts stepsizes only when necessary and never rejects iterates. The proposed method is universal since it does not need any problem parameters as input. Additionally, we provide an exact implementation of a proximal sampling oracle, analogous to the proximal map in optimization, along with simple complexity analyses for both the H\"older smooth and hybrid cases, using a novel technique based on a modified Gaussian integral. Finally, we combine this proximal sampling oracle and ASF to obtain a Markov chain Monte Carlo method with non-asymptotic complexity bounds for sampling in H\"older smooth and hybrid settings.

Abstract: Reducing computational scaling for simulating non-Markovian dissipative dynamics using artificial neural networks is both a major focus and formidable challenge in open quantum systems. To enable neural quantum states (NQSs), we encode environmental memory in dissipatons (quasiparticles with characteristic lifetimes), yielding the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation (DQME). The resulting NQS-DQME framework achieves compact representation of many-body correlations and non-Markovian memory. Benchmarking against numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion confirms NQS-DQME maintains comparable accuracy while enhancing scalability and interpretability. This methodology opens new paths to explore non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in previously intractable systems.

Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices expected in next-generation networks, a shift to over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. By leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and frequency domains. To advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis that addresses practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as transmitter synchronization (sync) errors and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we investigate the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under sync errors and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in OTA transmission. Using alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. In addition, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms that improve OTA transmission performance under sync errors and ISI. To ensure a fair comparison with existing waveforms such as raised cosine (RC) and better-than-raised-cosine (BTRC), we incorporate a custom loss function that integrates energy and bandwidth constraints along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without the need to rebuild the DNN structure, we also provide curve-fitting parameters for the selected DNN-based waveforms.

Abstract: Scoring rules evaluate probabilistic forecasts of an unknown state against the realized state and are a fundamental building block in the incentivized elicitation of information. This paper develops mechanisms for scoring elicited text against ground truth text by reducing the textual information elicitation problem to a forecast elicitation problem, via domain-knowledge-free queries to a large language model (specifically ChatGPT), and empirically evaluates their alignment with human preferences. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reduction achieves provable properness via black-box language models. The empirical evaluation is conducted on peer reviews from a peer-grading dataset, in comparison to manual instructor scores for the peer reviews.
  Our results suggest a paradigm of algorithmic artificial intelligence that may be useful for developing artificial intelligence technologies with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.

Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.

Abstract: We propose a novel Auto-Regressive (AR) image generation approach that models images as hierarchical compositions of interpretable visual layers. While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks remains challenging due to inherent spatial dependencies in images. Addressing the unique challenges of vision tasks, our method (CART) adds image details iteratively via semantically meaningful decompositions. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of CART by applying it across three distinct decomposition strategies: (i) Base-Detail Decomposition (Mumford-Shah smoothness), (ii) Intrinsic Decomposition (albedo/shading), and (iii) Specularity Decomposition (diffuse/specular). This next-detail strategy outperforms traditional next-token and next-scale approaches, improving controllability, semantic interpretability, and resolution scalability. Experiments show CART generates visually compelling results while enabling structured image manipulation, opening new directions for controllable generative modeling via physically or perceptually motivated image factorization.

arXiv:2411.18104v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by leveraging GPT-4 to generate meta-templates, ensuring diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills.

Abstract: Contaminant observations and outliers often cause problems when estimating the parameters of cognitive models, which are statistical models representing cognitive processes. In this study, we test and improve the robustness of parameter estimation using amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks. To this end, we conduct systematic analyses on a toy example and analyze both synthetic and real data using a popular cognitive model, the Drift Diffusion Models (DDM). First, we study the sensitivity of ABI to contaminants with tools from robust statistics: the empirical influence function and the breakdown point. Next, we propose a data augmentation or noise injection approach that incorporates a contamination distribution into the data-generating process during training. We examine several candidate distributions and evaluate their performance and cost in terms of accuracy and efficiency loss relative to a standard estimator. Introducing contaminants from a Cauchy distribution during training considerably increases the robustness of the neural density estimator as measured by bounded influence functions and a much higher breakdown point. Overall, the proposed method is straightforward and practical to implement and has a broad applicability in fields where outlier detection or removal is challenging.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs with small, carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification--making adversarial attacks a critical tool for evaluating robustness. Existing black-box methods typically entail a trade-off between precision and flexibility: pixel-sparse attacks (e.g., single- or few-pixel attacks) provide fine-grained control but lack adaptability, whereas patch- or frequency-based attacks improve efficiency or transferability, but at the cost of producing larger and less precise perturbations. We present GreedyPixel, a fine-grained black-box attack method that performs brute-force-style, per-pixel greedy optimization guided by a surrogate-derived priority map and refined by means of query feedback. It evaluates each coordinate directly without any gradient information, guaranteeing monotonic loss reduction and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum, while also yielding near white-box-level precision and pixel-wise sparsity and perceptual quality. On the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, spanning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models, GreedyPixel achieved state-of-the-art success rates with visually imperceptible perturbations, effectively bridging the gap between black-box practicality and white-box performance. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/greedypixel.

Abstract: We present a federated learning approach for Bayesian model-based clustering of large-scale binary and categorical datasets. We introduce a principled 'divide and conquer' inference procedure using variational inference with local merge and delete moves within batches of the data in parallel, followed by 'global' merge moves across batches to find global clustering structures. We show that these merge moves require only summaries of the data in each batch, enabling federated learning across local nodes without requiring the full dataset to be shared. Empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method performs well in comparison to existing clustering algorithms. We validate the practical utility of the method by applying it to large scale electronic health record (EHR) data.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents equipped with external tools have become increasingly powerful for complex tasks such as web shopping, automated email replies, and financial trading. However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing methods across three LLM agent datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/UDora.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent. BBFlow is available at https://github.com/graeter-group/bbflow.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.

We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.

Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground-truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors.To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data include label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. However, Bayesian inference for such spatially correlated discrete variables is notoriously intractable. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce a novel class of probabilistic models, which we term the ELBO-Computable Correlated Discrete Distribution (ECCD). By representing the discrete dependencies through a continuous latent Gaussian field with a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) structured covariance, our framework enables scalable and efficient variational inference for problems previously considered computationally prohibitive. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels. Code is available at https://github.com/pfnet-research/Bayesian_SpatialCorr.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for closed-book hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Symmetry-informed machine learning can exhibit advantages over machine learning which fails to account for symmetry. In the context of continuous symmetry detection, current state of the art experiments are largely limited to detecting affine transformations. Herein, we outline a computationally efficient framework for discovering infinitesimal generators of multi-parameter group actions which are not generally affine transformations. This framework accommodates the automatic discovery of the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators. We build upon recent work in continuous symmetry discovery by extending to neural networks and by restricting the symmetry search space to infinitesimal isometries. We also introduce symmetry enforcement of smooth models using vector field regularization, thereby improving model generalization. The notion of vector field similarity is also generalized for non-Euclidean Riemannian metric tensors.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable and efficient model architecture for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) in few-shot settings. FS-DAG leverages domain-specific and language/vision specific backbones within a modular framework to adapt to diverse document types with minimal data. The model is robust to practical challenges such as handling OCR errors, misspellings, and domain shifts, which are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient models that do not compromise on performance. Code : https://github.com/oracle-samples/fs-dag

Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

Abstract: The Political Compass Test (PCT) and similar surveys are commonly used to assess political bias in auto-regressive LLMs. Our rigorous statistical experiments show that while changes to standard generation parameters have minimal effect on PCT scores, prompt phrasing and fine-tuning individually and together can significantly influence results. Interestingly, fine-tuning on politically rich vs. neutral datasets does not lead to different shifts in scores. We also generalize these findings to a similar popular test called 8 Values. Humans do not change their responses to questions when prompted differently (``answer this question'' vs ``state your opinion''), or after exposure to politically neutral text, such as mathematical formulae. But the fact that the models do so raises concerns about the validity of these tests for measuring model bias, and paves the way for deeper exploration into how political and social views are encoded in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation but remain constrained by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code, leaving debugging largely unsolved. While Claude 4.5 Sonnet and Claude 4.1 Opus exceed 70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they achieve under 15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model purpose-built for debugging that integrates Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to traverse codebases up to 10 million lines, Persistent Debug Memory trained on over 15 million sessions, and a seven-layer fix-test-refine architecture. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude 4.1 Opus and GPT-4.1, respectively. On SWE-bench Lite, Chronos reaches a state-of-the-art 80.33% resolution rate (241 of 300), outperforming the next best system by 20 points and achieving repository-specific highs of 96.1% on Sympy and 90.4% on Django. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iterations by 65%, resolving complex multi-file and cross-repository bugs. It remains limited on hardware-dependent and dynamic language errors. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.

<title>Tight Bounds for Answering Adaptively Chosen Concentrated Queries</title>

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most $O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions. When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external disturbances.

arXiv:2507.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions. The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our method to support its adoption by the broader community.

Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility, yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence (-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44), and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility (-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies into sustainable urban policy design.

Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis demonstrate that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model: it exhibits a memory capacity that grows linearly with connectivity, a persistent spectral gap separating stored patterns from noise, and significantly enlarged basins of attraction. These results show that geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure yield associative memories with markedly enhanced stability and retrieval performance.

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations, eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made public when this paper is published.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian) reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines (pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown automata. pdRMs can recognise and reward temporally extended behaviours representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal state values. We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs, and space complexity results for the proposed learning problems. Lastly, we propose an approach for off-policy RL algorithms that exploits counterfactual experiences with pdRMs. We conclude by providing experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at https://github.com/MrLYG/CDCR-SFT.

Abstract: Sea ice plays an important role in stabilising the Earth system. Yet, representing its dynamics remains a major challenge for models, as the underlying processes are scale-invariant and highly anisotropic. This poses a dilemma: physics-based models that faithfully reproduce the observed dynamics are computationally costly, while efficient AI models sacrifice realism. Here, to resolve this dilemma, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI model to predict the evolution of the full Arctic sea-ice state at 12-hour increments. Trained for sub-daily forecasting on 20 years of sea-ice-ocean simulation data, GenSIM makes realistic predictions for 30 years, while reproducing the dynamical properties of sea ice with its leads and ridges and capturing long-term trends in the sea-ice volume. Notably, although solely driven by atmospheric reanalysis, GenSIM implicitly learns hidden signatures of multi-year ice-ocean interaction. Therefore, generative AI can extrapolate from sub-daily forecasts to decadal simulations, while retaining physical consistency.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

arXiv:2508.15212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Abstract: The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and simulated contact maps.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals - a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories-traditionally used for training value or reward models-can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We reframe GRPO into a staged training paradigm, leveraging a teacher's MCTS rollouts to construct a tree-structured curriculum of prefixes. This introduces the novel challenge of computing advantages for training samples that originate from different prefixes, each with a distinct expected return. To address this, we propose Staged Advantage Estimation (SAE), a framework for computing low-variance, prefix-aware advantages by projecting rewards onto a constraint set that respects the tree's hierarchy. Our empirical results on mathematical reasoning tasks show that SAE improves final accuracy over standard GRPO. This outcome is grounded in our theoretical analysis, which confirms that SAE reduces gradient variance-a principled path to improved sample efficiency. We demonstrate this through practical SAE implementations, comparing efficient heuristics against a formal quadratic program.

<title>Spacing Test for Fused Lasso</title>

Abstract: Detecting changepoints in a one-dimensional signal is a classical yet fundamental problem. The fused lasso provides an elegant convex formulation that produces a stepwise estimate of the mean, but quantifying the uncertainty of the detected changepoints remains difficult. Post-selection inference (PSI) offers a principled way to compute valid $p$-values after a data-driven selection, but its application to the fused lasso has been considered computationally cumbersome, requiring the tracking of many ``hit'' and ``leave'' events along the regularization path. In this paper, we show that the one-dimensional fused lasso has a surprisingly simple geometry: each changepoint enters in a strictly one-sided fashion, and there are no leave events. This structure implies that the so-called \emph{conservative spacing test} of Tibshirani et al.\ (2016), previously regarded as an approximation, is in fact \emph{exact}. The truncation region in the selective law reduces to a single lower bound given by the next knot on the LARS path. As a result, the exact selective $p$-value takes a closed form identical to the simple spacing statistic used in the LARS/lasso setting, with no additional computation. This finding establishes one of the rare cases in which an exact PSI procedure for the generalized lasso admits a closed-form pivot. We further validate the result by simulations and real data, confirming both exact calibration and high power.

Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised (MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of human-defined classification.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling method for the training of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which allows for sampling based on an arbitrary problem-specific heuristic which may depend on the network and its gradients. In particular we focus our analysis on the Allen-Cahn equations, attempting to accurately resolve the characteristic interfacial regions using a PINN without any post-hoc resampling. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of these methods over residual-adaptive frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables a 2-3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

Summary: 
Algorithmic fairness in criminal justice is a rapidly evolving field, with unresolved concepts such as group, individual, and process fairness. The proposed modification to standard group fairness involves minimizing a weighted error loss while maintaining small differences in false negative rates across protected groups. This approach simplifies finding solutions, potentially improving predictive accuracy and highlighting the ethical consideration of error costs. Critiques including biased data, latent affirmative action, and subgroup constraints are addressed. A practical framework for deployment in public decision systems focuses on need-based decisions, transparency, accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. This framework aims to align technical design with legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies utilizing risk assessment tools.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual, and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related tools.

<br />
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved code translation capabilities, particularly in converting C++ code to OpenMP for shared-memory parallelization. The OMPILOT encoder-decoder transformer is specifically designed for this task, utilizing custom pre-training objectives to incorporate parallel construct semantics and a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to enhance translation accuracy. Unlike previous methods focusing on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a broader semantic context. To evaluate the translation quality, a new metric called OMPBLEU is introduced, specifically tailored to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs. Overall, the use of LLMs like OMPILOT streamlines cross-language code conversion, reduces development overhead, and accelerates legacy code migration.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.

<div> personalized quantum federated learning, anomaly detection, quantum clients, quantum processing, quantum-centric personalization

Summary:<br /><br />Anomaly detection in various applications relies on context and limited anomaly-labeled data. Quantum federated learning (QFL) distributes model training among multiple quantum clients, eliminating the need for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, the heterogeneity in clients' hardware capabilities, noise levels, and data representation hinder global model training, especially with imbalanced or non-identically distributed data. To tackle this, personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) is introduced for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, adapting each client's model to their hardware characteristics and data representation. Experimental results demonstrate PQFL's effectiveness in improving anomaly detection accuracy, reducing false errors by up to 23% and achieving significant gains in AUROC and AUPR. The framework showcases scalability and efficacy in practical quantum federated settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.

Summary: <br />
The Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) is introduced as a variant of VAE that maintains Gaussian tractability while allowing non-diagonal posterior covariance. MVAE utilizes a global coupling matrix and per-sample diagonal scales to generate dataset-wide latent correlations and local uncertainty modulation, respectively. It offers analytic KL divergence calculations and a practical reparameterization method. In various datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, MVAE consistently outperforms diagonal-covariance VAEs in terms of reconstruction accuracy, calibration metrics, and unsupervised structure learning. The MVAE model also displays smoother and more coherent latent factor representations with sharper details. A fully reproducible implementation with training scripts is released for wider adoption and evaluation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a VAE variant that preserves Gaussian tractability while lifting the diagonal posterior restriction. MVAE factorizes each posterior covariance, where a \emph{global} coupling matrix $\mathbf{C}$ induces dataset-wide latent correlations and \emph{per-sample} diagonal scales modulate local uncertainty. This yields a full-covariance family with analytic KL and an efficient reparameterization via $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{C}\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$. Across Larochelle-style MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, MVAE consistently matches or improves reconstruction (MSE~$\downarrow$) and delivers robust gains in calibration (NLL/Brier/ECE~$\downarrow$) and unsupervised structure (NMI/ARI~$\uparrow$) relative to diagonal-covariance VAEs with matched capacity, especially at mid-range latent sizes. Latent-plane visualizations further indicate smoother, more coherent factor traversals and sharper local detail. We release a fully reproducible implementation with training/evaluation scripts and sweep utilities to facilitate fair comparison and reuse.

<div> Reinforcement learning, active learning, electronic health record phenotyping, risk prediction, noisy-label baselines <br />
Summary: The study introduces RELEAP, a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework for electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping. It aims to refine phenotypes for better risk prediction by using downstream prediction performance as feedback. RELEAP outperformed noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning methods in predicting incident lung cancer risk in a Duke University Health System cohort. It increased logistic AUC from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752, showing smoother and more stable gains. By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled approach to active learning. This optimized method reduces manual chart review, enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction, and provides a scalable, label-efficient paradigm for improving healthcare outcomes. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping often relies on noisy proxy labels, which undermine the reliability of downstream risk prediction. Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.
  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.
  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.
  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.
  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.

Summary: 
This study explores embedding reconstruction attacks in large language models (LLMs) applied to genomic sequences, focusing on the impact of fine-tuning on vulnerability. The research builds upon previous work by analyzing pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings using the HS3D genomic dataset. Specialized tokenization mechanisms for DNA sequences are implemented to enhance model processing capabilities. The study reveals that fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in various LLM architectures, such as XLNet, GPT-2, and BERT. Task-specific optimization is identified as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism for protecting sensitive genomic data. The results emphasize the importance of implementing advanced protective measures for language models handling genomic information and suggest that fine-tuning could be a valuable technique for enhancing privacy.

Abstract: This study investigates embedding reconstruction attacks in large language models (LLMs) applied to genomic sequences, with a specific focus on how fine-tuning affects vulnerability to these attacks. Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\%), and BERT (+7.8\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration.

<div> dynamic pruning, large language models, alignment degradation, safety-critical circuits, inference efficiency

Summary:
Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP) addresses the challenges faced by Large Language Models in efficient deployment. By building upon Probe Pruning, AAPP dynamically prunes circuits during inference to preserve alignment-relevant circuits, improving refusal rates by 50% at matched compute. This method enhances safety-critical circuit preservation by adaptively selecting circuits based on alignment, mitigating alignment degradation issues caused by dynamic pruning. Experiments conducted on various large language models demonstrate the effectiveness of AAPP in enabling efficient yet safety-preserving deployment of LLMs. AAPP offers a solution to the deployment challenges posed by the computational resources required for inference in Large Language Models, ensuring alignment vulnerabilities are addressed effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models require substantial computational resources for inference, posing deployment challenges. While dynamic pruning offers superior efficiency over static methods through adaptive circuit selection, it exacerbates alignment degradation by retaining only input-dependent safety-critical circuit preservation across diverse inputs. As a result, addressing these heightened alignment vulnerabilities remains critical. We introduce Alignment-Aware Probe Pruning (AAPP), a dynamic structured pruning method that adaptively preserves alignment-relevant circuits during inference, building upon Probe Pruning. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12B-IT show AAPP improves refusal rates by 50\% at matched compute, enabling efficient yet safety-preserving LLM deployment.

<div> spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, fairness violations, information-theoretic measures
Summary:
This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework to understand the various failure modes of machine learning systems, such as unfairness, brittleness, and poor performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence using information-theoretic measures, the study establishes equivalence conditions between spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. The theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\alpha$ leads to equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+\alpha)/(1-\alpha)$. Empirical validation across multiple datasets and architectures confirms the predicted equivalences within a 3% accuracy margin. This research paves the way for the systematic transfer of debiasing techniques across different problem domains, bridging the gap between fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts in machine learning. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\alpha$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+\alpha)/(1-\alpha)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains. This work bridges the literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

<br />
Summary:
This study addresses learning policies that maximize cumulative reward while meeting safety constraints in environments where the real dynamics may differ from the nominal model. The authors introduce the concept of Robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs) which require maximizing reward under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. The research demonstrates that Markovian policies may not be optimal under rectangular uncertainty sets. To combat this, an augmented state space that includes the remaining utility budget is introduced. The novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm is proposed with a sample complexity guarantee of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\epsilon^2)$ achieving at most $\epsilon$ violation. This is the first sample complexity guarantee for RCMDPs. Empirical results support the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of learning policies that maximize cumulative reward while satisfying safety constraints, even when the real environment differs from a simulator or nominal model. We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\epsilon^2)$ achieving at most $\epsilon$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the {\em first sample complexity guarantee} for RCMDP. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

The article discusses the importance of ensuring basic methodological coherence in health research before implementing advanced analytical tools such as Machine Learning (ML) and Big Data analysis. It presents a case study highlighting the significance of verifying fundamental design choices to avoid misleading or contradictory results. By applying standard statistical methods and national benchmarks to a vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events cohort study, the authors identify severe paradoxes and mathematical artifacts due to uncorrected selection bias. The study emphasizes the necessity of utilizing robust methods like Propensity Score Matching for valid causal inference in complex health research involving administrative data. The findings underscore the critical role of foundational epidemiological consistency before employing advanced statistical modeling approaches.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization

<div> Keywords: Activation functions, Neural networks, ReLU, N-ReLU, Gaussian noise<br />
Summary:<br />
Activation functions play a crucial role in enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. The standard ReLU activation function often faces the issue of dead or inactive neurons due to its hard zero cutoff. To address this problem, N-ReLU is introduced as a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU. By replacing negative activations with Gaussian noise while maintaining the same expected output, N-ReLU ensures gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as a regularizer during training. Experimental results on the MNIST dataset using various neural network architectures demonstrate that N-ReLU achieves comparable accuracy to other popular activation functions like LeakyReLU and GELU at moderate noise levels. This approach effectively enhances optimization robustness without requiring modifications to network structures or additional parameters.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental for enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or "dead" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed. These results demonstrate that lightweight Gaussian noise injection offers a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

Summary: 
SCALAR benchmark assesses interaction sparsity in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by comparing TopK SAEs, Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), and Staircase SAEs. Staircase SAEs, utilizing weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features, show a significant improvement in interaction sparsity compared to TopK SAEs, with a relative improvement of 59.67% ± 1.83% for feedforward layers and 63.15% ± 1.35% for transformer blocks. JSAEs offer a modest improvement over TopK SAEs for feedforward layers but struggle to train effectively across transformer blocks. Staircase and TopK SAEs perform well throughout the residual stream. Validation on a toy model and GPT-2 Small demonstrates that Staircase SAEs maintain interaction sparsity improvements while preserving feature interpretability. This study underscores the importance of interaction sparsity in SAEs and provides insights into designing more effective and interpretable neural network architectures. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to decompose neural networks into interpretable features and map their connecting circuits. The standard approach trains sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on each layer's activations. However, SAEs trained in isolation don't encourage sparse cross-layer connections, inflating extracted circuits where upstream features needlessly affect multiple downstream features. Current evaluations focus on individual SAE performance, leaving interaction sparsity unexamined. We introduce SCALAR (Sparse Connectivity Assessment of Latent Activation Relationships), a benchmark measuring interaction sparsity between SAE features. We also propose "Staircase SAEs", using weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features. Using SCALAR, we compare TopK SAEs, Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), and Staircase SAEs. Staircase SAEs improve relative sparsity over TopK SAEs by $59.67\% \pm 1.83\%$ (feedforward) and $63.15\% \pm 1.35\%$ (transformer blocks). JSAEs provide $8.54\% \pm 0.38\%$ improvement over TopK for feedforward layers but cannot train effectively across transformer blocks, unlike Staircase and TopK SAEs which work anywhere in the residual stream. We validate on a $216$K-parameter toy model and GPT-$2$ Small ($124$M), where Staircase SAEs maintain interaction sparsity improvements while preserving feature interpretability. Our work highlights the importance of interaction sparsity in SAEs through benchmarking and comparing promising architectures.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, financial tasks, output consistency, deterministic testing, regulatory compliance

Summary:
Financial institutions use Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like reconciliations and regulatory reporting, but output drift can impact trust and auditability. This study compares five LLM architectures on financial tasks and shows that smaller models achieve better output consistency than larger ones. To address this issue, the researchers developed a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness and task-specific invariant checking methods. They also propose a three-tier model classification system and an audit-ready attestation system for validation. The evaluation across different models and tasks revealed varying levels of output consistency and sensitivity to drift. The study demonstrates the importance of deterministic behavior in AI deployments for financial tasks and provides a framework aligned with regulatory requirements. This research challenges the notion that larger models are always better for production deployment in the financial sector. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.
  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.
  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

<div> Graph Neural Networks, Heterogeneous Graphs, Mixture-of-Experts, Expert Routing, Type-Agnostic Specialization

Summary:
Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER) aims to address the issue of overreliance on surface-level labels in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) by integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT). The proposed HER layer stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to promote type-agnostic specialization, challenging the necessity of type-specific experts. Evaluation on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP datasets for link prediction shows that HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB reveals that HER experts specialize based on semantic patterns, such as movie genres, rather than node types, indicating that the routing is driven by latent semantics. This work demonstrates that enforcing regularization of type dependence in expert routing results in more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations, introducing a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

<div> factorized behavior policy, partial action replacement, offline multi-agent reinforcement learning, distribution shift, Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning 

Summary:<br />
This study addresses the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution joint actions in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The researchers propose a strategy called partial action replacement (PAR) that updates only a single or partial agents' actions while keeping others fixed to the behavioral data. This approach reduces distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. They develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL) using PAR to mitigate out-of-distribution issues and dynamically adjust PAR strategies based on value estimation uncertainty. Theoretical analysis shows that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents instead of exponentially with the joint-action space. SPaCQL adapts to distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights, leading to tighter value error bounds in offline MARL problems. Empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL's effectiveness in policy learning, especially when the offline dataset exhibits independence structure. <div>
arXiv:2511.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces two differential privacy (DP) algorithms, MURAG and MURAG-ADA, for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems in multi-query settings. MURAG utilizes an individual privacy filter to limit privacy loss based on document retrieval frequency, while MURAG-ADA enhances utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds for document selection. Experiments show that these methods maintain meaningful utility while scaling to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget of around ε≈10. The research addresses the privacy concerns of RAG systems when dealing with sensitive information, providing a practical solution for protecting private data while maintaining system performance. The proposed algorithms improve upon single-query DP guarantees, making them more applicable in real-world scenarios where multiple queries are commonplace. <div>
arXiv:2511.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

Summary: 
AdaTrip is a new framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting that incorporates adaptive, time-varying graph learning techniques. It considers spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs by constructing dynamic graphs with reservoirs as nodes and directed edges representing hydrological connections. Utilizing attention mechanisms, AdaTrip can automatically identify important spatial and temporal dependencies, leading to improved performance compared to existing methods. The framework is particularly effective for reservoirs with limited historical data, thanks to parameter sharing. Furthermore, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at both edge and time-step levels, offering valuable insights for operational decision-making in water resource management. The code for AdaTrip is publicly available for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Reservoir inflow prediction is crucial for water resource management, yet existing approaches mainly focus on single-reservoir models that ignore spatial dependencies among interconnected reservoirs. We introduce AdaTrip as an adaptive, time-varying graph learning framework for multi-reservoir inflow forecasting. AdaTrip constructs dynamic graphs where reservoirs are nodes with directed edges reflecting hydrological connections, employing attention mechanisms to automatically identify crucial spatial and temporal dependencies. Evaluation on thirty reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates superiority over existing baselines, with improved performance for reservoirs with limited records through parameter sharing. Additionally, AdaTrip provides interpretable attention maps at edge and time-step levels, offering insights into hydrological controls to support operational decision-making.

Abstract: Effective crime linkage analysis is crucial for identifying serial offenders and enhancing public safety. To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts. Our results show that advanced machine learning approaches can substantially enhance linkage accuracy, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while offering interpretable insights to support investigative decision-making.

<div> keywords: Character-Level Autoencoder, non-semantic data, relational databases, data grouping, industrial datasets <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) method for identifying semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets. Unlike traditional NLP models, the CAE operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data. By encoding text representations of columns and extracting high-dimensional feature embeddings, the CAE efficiently groups data. The approach significantly reduces memory requirements and training time by maintaining a fixed dictionary size. Experimental results show that the CAE approach outperforms traditional NLP methods, achieving 80.95% accuracy in column matching tasks. This work addresses the challenges of non-semantic data in enterprise relational databases, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling in industrial datasets at scale.<br />

Abstract: Enterprise relational databases increasingly contain vast amounts of non-semantic data - IP addresses, product identifiers, encoded keys, and timestamps - that challenge traditional semantic analysis. This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale.

Summary:
The article introduces ZeroSim, a transformer-based framework for efficient performance evaluation in learning-based analog circuit design automation. ZeroSim aims to achieve robust generalization across trained topologies and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without fine-tuning. Key strategies include a diverse training corpus covering over 60 amplifier topologies, unified topology embeddings for robust generalization, and a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach to maintain consistent structural representations. Experimental results show that ZeroSim outperforms baseline models, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. When integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a significant speedup compared to conventional SPICE simulations, highlighting its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent advancements in learning-based analog circuit design automation have tackled tasks such as topology generation, device sizing, and layout synthesis, efficient performance evaluation remains a major bottleneck. Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for uncertainty estimation in Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate hallucinations and enhance model trustworthiness. The method approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-K probabilities, eliminating the need for multiple samples or extra computation. An adaptive mechanism is utilized to determine the optimal K value for filtering out low-confidence probabilities and improving flexibility. Experimental results on free-form question-answering datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing expensive baselines. By efficiently estimating uncertainty, this approach contributes to addressing the issue of factually incorrect outputs in LLMs, advancing the goal of enhancing the reliability and credibility of these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect or misleading outputs. Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue. However, existing methods often require multiple samples or extra computation to assess semantic entropy. This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities. Experimental results on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

Summary:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have shown high performance in detecting melanoma but face challenges in adoption due to disparities in performance across demographic subgroups like gender, race, and age. Existing benchmarking efforts often focus on fairness metrics like AUROC, which overlooks calibration as a metric to evaluate models' accuracy. This study evaluates the performance of the top skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on different datasets and compares it with other models in terms of sex, race, and age subgroups. The results indicate that while current models improve discriminative accuracy, they tend to overpredict risk and exhibit calibration issues on new datasets. The study emphasizes the need for robust model auditing strategies and comprehensive metadata collection to ensure equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

<br />Summary:
The article discusses the vulnerability of reinforcement learning systems to adversarial attacks in vision-based environments. Existing defenses against such attacks rely on $l_p$ norm-constrained methods, which struggle to alter the semantics of image inputs significantly. In response, the authors propose SHIFT, a policy-agnostic diffusion-based attack that generates perturbed states with altered semantics while remaining realistic and difficult to detect. Evaluations show that SHIFT outperforms existing attacks in breaking defenses and maintaining perceptual stealth. The results underscore the need for robust policies in reinforcement learning to address the threat of semantics-aware adversarial perturbations. <div>
arXiv:2511.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.

Summary: <br />
This paper presents a new framework utilizing Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) to tackle multidimensional optimization challenges in engineering. Traditional simulation-based methods are limited in optimizing one problem at a time and require extensive computational time. The proposed approach overcomes these limitations by employing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to optimize a micromixer design by exploring key parameters. The agent interacts with a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) environment, resulting in instantaneous solutions to complex optimization problems. Through training, the agent achieved consistently greater efficiency across various Schmidt numbers, with a maximum improvement of 32% at Schmidt number 13.3. A comparison with Genetic Algorithm highlighted the advantages of the proposed method. This framework demonstrates the potential of Sci-ML in revolutionizing multidimensional optimization processes in engineering applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.

Summary:
The paper presents a solution to the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services by utilizing strategies for repositioning vehicles and transferring personnel with the use of scooters. It divides the service area into zones based on temporal patterns, allowing discrete optimization methods to be applied. The algorithm makes decisions considering the number of cars per zone, demand probability density, and trip durations. Real-world data from a car-sharing service operator in Poland was used for experiments. The proposed algorithm showed an average improvement of 8.44% over the baseline scenario, while the MIP solver had a 19.6% improvement, but it included trip selection decisions not relevant to current business rules. The solution could enhance performance metrics by approximately 3%-10% depending on workforce size. <div>

Abstract: The paper addresses the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services by presenting a solution focused on strategies for repositioning vehicles and transferring personnel with the use of scooters. Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\% and 19.6\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.

Summary:
In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the challenge of learning how to achieve goals in an environment has persisted. Current methods struggle with reasoning over long time horizons. The article addresses the issue of estimating temporal distances between observations, comparing temporal difference and Monte Carlo methods. By integrating these approaches, the authors propose a GCRL method that utilizes a multistep Monte-Carlo return to fit a quasimetric distance. Their method outperforms existing GCRL methods in long-horizon simulated tasks, including visual observations up to 4000 steps. Additionally, the method is successfully applied in real-world robotic manipulation tasks, specifically in a Bridge setup, enabling multistep stitching from unlabeled offline visual data. This work represents a significant advancement in GCRL methods, particularly in handling long-horizon tasks and real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning how to reach goals in an environment is a longstanding challenge in AI, yet reasoning over long horizons remains a challenge for modern methods. The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.

By jointly inferring graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation can be achieved even with limited data.

arXiv:2511.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) faces challenges due to limited high-quality labeled data and annotation noise. A new two-stage token-level entropy optimization method is proposed to address these issues. In the exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse output generation, preventing convergence to noisy labels. This ensures reliable reward estimation for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). As training progresses, the model transitions to the exploitation phase where entropy minimization enhances prediction accuracy. Empirical tests on MLLM backbones show superior performance over existing methods. The approach unifies external, internal, and entropy-based techniques, offering robust results across various noise settings and tasks.

arXiv:2511.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is highly dependent on high-quality labeled data, which is often scarce and prone to substantial annotation noise in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.

Summary:
The article introduces an extension of the schedule-free method, allowing for any scheduler instead of just a constant learning rate. By updating the averaging parameter as a function of the learning rate, the theory shows predictive power in practical executions on deep neural networks. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay schedule, the optimal convergence rate is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. A new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free is designed using convexity, with an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence proven. The new Polyak schedule performs well compared to baselines on a black-box model distillation task. Overall, the article advances the understanding and application of schedule-free methods in optimizing deep neural network performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed schedule-free method has been shown to achieve strong performance when hyperparameter tuning is limited. The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.

- Researchers investigate whether the model's latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. 
- By training linear classifiers on a dataset of embeddings, they identify three concepts: the land-sea boundary, extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. 
- The results show that Aurora learns physically consistent features, but struggles with capturing rare events.

Abstract: The high accuracy of large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora is often accompanied by a lack of transparency, as their internal representations remain largely opaque. This "black box" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events. This work underscores the critical need for interpretability methods to validate and build trust in the next generation of Al-driven weather models.

We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.

Summary:
The article discusses the need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL) in complex machine learning applications. It aims to address problems with conflicting objectives and decision variables across different layers. The proposed weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) algorithm framework is designed for deterministic and stochastic settings, guaranteeing finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rates with low oracle complexity. This framework allows for the identification of preference-guided Pareto-stationary solutions and systematic exploration of the Pareto front. The theoretical foundations and algorithmic efficiency of MOBL optimization algorithms are explored, with empirical experiments validating the theoretical results. The study fills a gap in the understanding of MOBL and provides a systematic approach to tackling complex machine learning problems with multiple conflicting objectives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) applications grow increasingly complex in recent years, modern ML frameworks often need to address multiple potentially conflicting objectives with coupled decision variables across different layers. This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results.

Summary: The paper introduces Murphy, a framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. It addresses the limitations of existing approaches like GRPO in agentic tasks requiring iterative decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, differential privacy, AdamW, DP-AdamW, DP-AdamW-BC

Summary:
DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC are introduced as differentially private variants of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. The theoretical results provide privacy and convergence guarantees for both optimizers. Empirical analysis across multiple privacy budgets ($\epsilon = 1, 3, 7$) shows that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers in text classification, image classification, and graph node classification tasks. DP-AdamW scores over 15% higher in text classification, up to 5% higher in image classification, and consistently 1% higher in graph node classification compared to other optimizers. Interestingly, incorporating bias correction in DP-AdamW (DP-AdamW-BC) consistently decreases accuracy, contrary to the improvement seen with DP-AdamBC over DP-Adam. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing differentially private deep learning models while ensuring privacy protection. 

<br /><br />Summary: DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC, variants of the AdamW optimizer with DP, exhibit strong performance in various classification tasks compared to existing differentially private optimizers. DP-AdamW shows higher accuracy rates, while DP-AdamW-BC, with bias correction, decreases accuracy inconsistently in different scenarios. <div>

Abstract: As deep learning methods increasingly utilize sensitive data on a widespread scale, differential privacy (DP) offers formal guarantees to protect against information leakage during model training. A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($\epsilon = 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\% higher on text classification, up to 5\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\% higher on graph node classification. Moreover, we empirically show that incorporating bias correction in DP-AdamW (DP-AdamW-BC) consistently decreases accuracy, in contrast to the improvement of DP-AdamBC improvement over DP-Adam.

<div> modular framework, universal approximation, deep learning architectures, progressive refinement, expressive power
<br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a novel modular framework for proving the universal approximation property in deep learning architectures. Instead of relying on separate proofs for each architecture type, the framework defines a Universal Approximation Module (UAM) as a basic building block with the universal approximation property. By composing deep networks using these UAMs, the overall network retains the universal approximation property. The approximation process is viewed as a progressive refinement across modules, offering a unified analysis of various architecture types. This approach not only eliminates the need for separate proofs for different architectures but also allows for a step-by-step understanding of how the expressive power evolves throughout the network. <div>
arXiv:2511.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning architectures are highly diverse. To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.

Summary: <br />
The study examines how trajectory value is influenced by the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control, focusing on Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR setting. It reveals a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE, showing a variance-mediated mechanism. Higher PE leads to lower gradient variance, while near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, impacting marginal contribution. By stabilizing with state whitening or Fisher preconditioning, the variance channel is neutralized, and information content becomes dominant, resulting in a positive correlation. Experiments validate the mechanism and suggest that decision-aligned scores can complement Shapley for pruning toxic subsets. <div>

Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.

Summary: 
This study introduces a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class motor imagery (MI) classification in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The framework includes a multi-scale signal processing module and an uncertainty estimation module to enhance classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variability.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to decode motor intent from noninvasive neural signals to enable control of external devices, but practical deployment remains limited by noise and variability in motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

Summary: 
The article presents a generalized spectral framework that elucidates the relationship between learning dynamics and model compression in neural networks. It introduces a spectral evolution function characterized by an effective spectral-temporal elasticity, encompassing various scaling behaviors observed in different settings. This framework unifies existing theories on learning and compression, offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. By generalizing the spectral evolution function to an asymptotically polynomial form, the framework establishes a consistent relation between learning dynamics and compression phenomena. The proposed framework not only recovers previous theories but also provides a more holistic perspective on how different factors such as model size, dataset size, and compute resources impact the performance metrics in neural networks. The framework serves as a valuable tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of neural networks in various scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical scaling laws describe how test loss and other performance metrics depend on model size, dataset size, and compute. While such laws are consistent within specific regimes, apparently distinct scaling behaviors have been reported for related settings such as model compression. Motivated by recent progress in spectral analyses of neural representations, this paper develops a \emph{generalized spectral framework} that unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena under a common functional ansatz. We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(\lambda t)=\lambda t$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(\lambda,t;\beta)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $\rho(\beta)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression

<div> reachability analysis, Hamilton-Jacobi, safety assurance, reinforcement learning, conformal prediction

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework using conformal prediction to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when approximating the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) value function for safety verification in autonomous systems. The HJ value function is computationally expensive to compute, leading to the use of reinforcement learning to approximate it. However, learned value functions and policies may not always be correct, causing uncertainty in safety guarantees. The conformal prediction framework is utilized to bound this uncertainty and provide safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies. The framework calibrates the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned safe policy, deriving safety guarantees under this switched policy. Additionally, the article explores using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter, comparing its performance to using individual value functions alone. <div>
arXiv:2511.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework that uses multiple test functions to represent task objectives, making it easier to define tasks compared to traditional reward functions in reinforcement learning. The framework includes pass-fail tests for defining the optimal objective and indicative tests for guiding the learning process. It is shown that using a trajectory return function that assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set leads to a policy closer to the optimal policy set. A lexicographic heuristic approach is proposed for learning the trajectory return function and an algorithm implementation of TdRL is developed. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL can match or outperform handcrafted reward methods in policy training, while also supporting multi-objective optimization. TdRL provides a novel perspective for representing task objectives in RL applications, addressing challenges in reward design. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

It contains episodes with support pairs and queries in 256 tokens, allowing for quick iteration with small models and offering a task space with adjustable parameters such as alphabet size, radius, rule family, and more. The benchmark provides 95k training episodes and two 1k test splits for evaluation. Various baseline models are tested, with a vanilla transformer achieving high accuracy on both interpolation and extrapolation tasks. A large closed model and an ensemble model combining the transformer with a symbolic baseline also show promising results. CellARC allows for exploration of generalization without human biases, controlled difficulty sampling, and reproducible studies on rule inference by models within constrained budgets.

Abstract: We introduce CellARC, a synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata (CA). Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines. CellARC decouples generalization from anthropomorphic priors, supports unlimited difficulty-controlled sampling, and enables reproducible studies of how quickly models infer new rules under tight budgets. Our strongest small-model baseline (a 10M-parameter vanilla transformer) outperforms recent recursive models (TRM, HRM), reaching 58.0%/32.4% per-token accuracy on the interpolation/extrapolation splits, while a large closed model (GPT-5 High) attains 62.3%/48.1% on subsets of 100 test tasks. An ensemble that chooses per episode between the Transformer and the best symbolic baseline reaches 65.4%/35.5%, highlighting neuro-symbolic complementarity.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) has been widely used as an effective generative model. Although RF is primarily based on probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), recent studies have shown that injecting noise through reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for sampling can achieve superior generative performance. Inspired by Positive-incentive Noise ($\pi$-noise), we propose an innovative generative algorithm to train $\pi$-noise generators, namely Rectified Noise ($\Delta$RN), which improves the generative performance by injecting $\pi$-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models. After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $\pi$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets. Notably, we find that: (1) RF models using Rectified Noise reduce FID from \textbf{10.16 to 9.05} on ImageNet-1k. (2) The models of $\pi$-noise generators achieve improved performance with only \textbf{0.39\%} additional training parameters.

<div> Keywords: Feedback Descent, text artifacts, structured feedback, preference learning, molecule discovery

Summary: 
Feedback Descent introduces a novel approach to optimizing text artifacts such as prompts, code, and molecules through structured textual feedback. By preserving detailed critiques rather than compressing them to binary preferences, it widens the information bottleneck in preference learning and enables targeted edits in text space. The framework leverages in-context learning to transform structured feedback into directional information, facilitating more effective optimization. Unlike existing methods that simplify judgments into binary decisions, Feedback Descent utilizes high-bandwidth textual feedback as supervision for iterative improvements. This approach does not modify model weights and is task-agnostic. Evaluation across three diverse domains demonstrates that Feedback Descent outperforms state-of-the-art optimization methods and even specialized molecular optimizers in molecule discovery tasks. In the DOCKSTRING benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a large compound database across six protein targets.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards. By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers. In the DOCKSTRING molecule discovery benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a database with more than $260{,}000$ compounds across six protein targets.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Language Models, Self-Examining, Verifiable Rewards, Human Feedback 

Summary: 
Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL) is proposed to address the challenges of applying Reinforcement Learning to open-domain tasks. SERL utilizes the large language model as both Actor and Judge, introducing two reward mechanisms without external signals. Rewards are derived from pairwise comparison judgments and self-consistency rewards to improve both actor and judge capabilities. Experimental results show that SERL outperforms existing self-improvement methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on open-domain tasks. The method shows a significant improvement in the win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness comparable to larger models like Qwen3-32B. SERL provides a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of language models in reinforcement learning tasks.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.

Abstract: Data augmentation in time series forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance by introducing variability while maintaining the underlying temporal patterns. However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a decision-focused continual learning framework for power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports. Traditional scheduling processes involve predicting and then optimizing tasks, but these approaches struggle to adapt to changing task configurations. The proposed framework addresses this issue by adapting online to a stream of scheduling tasks and using Fisher information-based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization. A differentiable convex surrogate helps stabilize gradient backpropagation during training. By learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new tasks while retaining generalization on prior tasks, the framework achieves superior decision performance and generalization compared to existing methods. Experiments conducted at Jurong Port confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showcasing improved decision quality and generalization while reducing computational costs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

Summary: The article introduces a new framework for offline Imitation Learning (IL) that addresses the challenge of dynamic environment shifts. The Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning framework learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics. By formulating the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, the framework seeks a policy that minimizes imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art offline IL baselines in terms of robustness and generalization, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments. <div>

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has proven highly effective for robotic and control tasks where manually designing reward functions or explicit controllers is infeasible. However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.

<div> Machine unlearning, text-to-image diffusion models, continual unlearning, utility collapse, parameter drift<br />
<br />
Summary:
Continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models is challenging due to rapid utility collapse where models forget retained knowledge after a few requests. This is traced to parameter drift from pre-training weights, highlighting the need for regularization. Regularizers are studied to mitigate drift and maintain compatibility with existing unlearning methods. Semantic awareness is crucial for preserving concepts near unlearning targets, proposing a gradient-projection method to constrain parameter drift. This approach significantly improves continual unlearning performance and complements other regularizers. The study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and offers insights, baselines, and potential directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning--the ability to remove designated concepts from a pre-trained model--has advanced rapidly, particularly for text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.

<title>Low-Rank Curvature for Zeroth-Order Optimization in LLM Fine-Tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LOREN, a curvature-aware zeroth-order (ZO) optimization method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Existing ZO methods, which estimate gradients via finite differences using random perturbations, often suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions. Our approach addresses these challenges by: (i) reformulating the problem of gradient preconditioning as that of adaptively estimating an anisotropic perturbation distribution for gradient estimation, (ii) capturing curvature through a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner using the framework of natural evolution strategies, and (iii) applying a REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator to reduce variance. Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.

<title>Generalizable Insights for Graph Transformers in Theory and Practice</title>

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown strong empirical performance, yet current architectures vary widely in their use of attention mechanisms, positional embeddings (PEs), and expressivity. Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.

<title>From Sequential to Recursive: Enhancing Decision-Focused Learning with Bidirectional Feedback</title>

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) has emerged as a powerful end-to-end alternative to conventional predict-then-optimize (PTO) pipelines by directly optimizing predictive models through downstream decision losses. Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.

Abstract: In modern sequential decision-making systems, the construction of an optimal candidate action space is critical to efficient inference. However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/DynaAct.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online linear regression setting in which the observed feature vectors are corrupted by noise and the learner can pay to reduce the noise level. In practice, this may happen for several reasons: for example, because features can be measured more accurately using more expensive equipment, or because data providers can be incentivized to release less private features. Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors). Our analysis leverages matrix martingale concentration, showing that the empirical loss uniformly converges to the expected one for all payments and linear predictors.

<title>An Integrated Fusion Framework for Ensemble Learning Leveraging Gradient Boosting and Fuzzy Rule-Based Models</title>

Abstract: The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.

Abstract: Property-constrained molecular generation and editing are crucial in AI-driven drug discovery but remain hindered by two factors: (i) capturing the complex relationships between molecular structures and multiple properties remains challenging, and (ii) the narrow coverage and incomplete annotations of molecular properties weaken the effectiveness of property-based models. To tackle these limitations, we propose HSPAG, a data-efficient framework featuring hierarchical structure-property alignment. By treating SMILES and molecular properties as complementary modalities, the model learns their relationships at atom, substructure, and whole-molecule levels. Moreover, we select representative samples through scaffold clustering and hard samples via an auxiliary variational auto-encoder (VAE), substantially reducing the required pre-training data. In addition, we incorporate a property relevance-aware masking mechanism and diversified perturbation strategies to enhance generation quality under sparse annotations. Experiments demonstrate that HSPAG captures fine-grained structure-property relationships and supports controllable generation under multiple property constraints. Two real-world case studies further validate the editing capabilities of HSPAG.

Abstract: AMD GPUs offer state-of-the-art compute and memory bandwidth; however, peak performance AMD kernels are written in raw assembly. To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors. HipKittens is released at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens.

<title>Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.
  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.
  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.
  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

Abstract: Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.

Abstract: Sustainability and efficiency have become essential considerations in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems, yet existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols. Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.

arXiv:2511.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL). In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.

Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.

Abstract: Learning to simulate complex physical systems from data has emerged as a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical solvers, which often require prohibitive computational costs for high-fidelity solutions. Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.

<title>The Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE): A novel approach to online agnostic continual learning using dataset compression</title>

Abstract: In order to achieve Continual Learning (CL), the problem of catastrophic forgetting, one that has plagued neural networks since their inception, must be overcome. The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods. Additionally, OPRE requires only minimal and interpretable hypothesis on the data to come. We suggest that online dataset compression could well be necessary to achieve fully agnostic CL.

<title>Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

<title>PrefPoE: Advantage-Guided Preference Fusion for Learning Where to Explore</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning remains a critical challenge, as naive entropy maximization often results in high variance and inefficient policy updates. We introduce \textbf{PrefPoE}, a novel \textit{Preference-Product-of-Experts} framework that performs intelligent, advantage-guided exploration via the first principled application of product-of-experts (PoE) fusion for single-task exploration-exploitation balancing. By training a preference network to concentrate probability mass on high-advantage actions and fusing it with the main policy through PoE, PrefPoE creates a \textbf{soft trust region} that stabilizes policy updates while maintaining targeted exploration. Across diverse control tasks spanning both continuous and discrete action spaces, PrefPoE demonstrates consistent improvements: +321\% on HalfCheetah-v4 (1276~$\rightarrow$~5375), +69\% on Ant-v4, +276\% on LunarLander-v2, with consistently enhanced training stability and sample efficiency. Unlike standard PPO, which suffers from entropy collapse, PrefPoE sustains adaptive exploration through its unique dynamics, thereby preventing premature convergence and enabling superior performance. Our results establish that learning \textit{where to explore} through advantage-guided preferences is as crucial as learning how to act, offering a general framework for enhancing policy gradient methods across the full spectrum of reinforcement learning domains. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved tremendous success in natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific computing through its self-attention mechanism. However, its core components-positional encoding and attention mechanisms-have lacked a unified physical or mathematical interpretation. This paper proposes a structural theoretical framework that integrates positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms for in-depth theoretical investigation. We map discrete positions (such as text token indices and image pixel coordinates) to spatial functions on continuous manifolds, enabling a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators acting over embedded manifolds.

<title>Data-Driven Discovery of Feature Groups in Clinical Time Series</title>

arXiv:2511.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical time series data are critical for patient monitoring and predictive modeling. These time series are typically multivariate and often comprise hundreds of heterogeneous features from different data sources. The grouping of features based on similarity and relevance to the prediction task has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures. However, defining these groups a priori using only semantic knowledge is challenging, even for domain experts. To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms static clustering approaches on synthetic data and achieves performance comparable to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data. Moreover, the learned feature groups are clinically interpretable, enabling data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between variables.

<title>Rethinking Explanation Evaluation under the Retraining Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature attribution has gained prominence as a tool for explaining model decisions, yet evaluating explanation quality remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth explanations. To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

<title>Test-time Diverse Reasoning by Riemannian Activation Steering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08305</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

<title>Improving the accuracy and generalizability of molecular property regression models with a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

<title>Adversarial Bias: Data Poisoning Attacks on Fairness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI and machine learning systems in real-world applications, ensuring their fairness has become increasingly critical. The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.

<title>LPPG-RL: Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with Subproblem Exploration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which consist of multiple conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities, are common in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.

arXiv:2511.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity and opacity of neural networks (NNs) pose significant challenges, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where understanding decision-making processes is crucial. To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies. All code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/ProtoScore .

Abstract: While Deep Learning (DL) experts often have prior knowledge about which hyperparameter settings yield strong performance, only few Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms can leverage such prior knowledge and none incorporate priors over multiple objectives. As DL practitioners often need to optimize not just one but many objectives, this is a blind spot in the algorithmic landscape of HPO. To address this shortcoming, we introduce PriMO, the first HPO algorithm that can integrate multi-objective user beliefs. We show PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 DL benchmarks in the multi-objective and single-objective setting, clearly positioning itself as the new go-to HPO algorithm for DL practitioners.

arXiv:2511.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across a wide range of domains. While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting. The code is available on https://github.com/PlanckChang/EMAformer.

Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In graph-structured multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) adversarial tasks such as pursuit and confrontation, agents must coordinate under highly dynamic interactions, where sparse rewards hinder efficient policy learning. We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the normalization term (also known as the partition function) in the contrastive loss is a central challenge for training Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models. Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods. Extensive experiments on large-scale CLIP training, spanning datasets from millions to billions of samples, demonstrate that NeuCLIP outperforms previous methods.

<title>Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Cardiac Electrophysiology</title>

arXiv:2511.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately simulating systems governed by PDEs, such as voltage fields in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) modelling, remains a significant modelling challenge. Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.

<title>HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425</link>

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

Abstract: Deep learning has brought significant advancements to X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction, offering solutions to challenges arising from modern imaging technologies. These developments benefit from methods that combine classical reconstruction techniques with data-driven approaches. Differentiable operators play a key role in this integration by enabling end-to-end optimization and the incorporation of physical modeling within neural networks.
  In this work, we present an updated version of PYRO-NN, a Python-based library for differentiable CT reconstruction. The updated framework extends compatibility to PyTorch and introduces native CUDA kernel support for efficient projection and back-projection operations across parallel, fan, and cone-beam geometries. Additionally, it includes tools for simulating imaging artifacts, modeling arbitrary acquisition trajectories, and creating flexible, end-to-end trainable pipelines through a high-level Python API.

<title>Coherence Mechanisms for Provable Self-Improvement</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08440</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08440</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-improvement is a critical capability for large language models and other intelligent systems, enabling them to refine their behavior and internal consistency without external supervision. Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.
  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \emph{direct} and \emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.
  Furthermore, we establish a general \emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure. This culminates in rigidity results under the demand for universal improvement, establishing coherence as a fundamental and, in a formal sense, necessary principle for provable self-improvement.

<title>One Model for All: Universal Pre-training for EEG based Emotion Recognition across Heterogeneous Datasets and Paradigms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08444</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition is hampered by profound dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability), hindering generalizable models. Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop. This work paves the way for more universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.

Abstract: In the context of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, the efficient splitting of categorical features using standard criteria like GINI and Entropy is well-established. However, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion for categorical features has traditionally relied on various numerical encoding methods. This paper demonstrates that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for the MAE criteria. Furthermore, we present a novel and efficient splitting algorithm that addresses the challenges of handling categorical features with the MAE criterion. Our findings underscore the limitations of existing approaches and offer a promising solution to enhance the handling of categorical data in CART algorithms.

Abstract: Transmitter localization in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is a critical topic with many applications. However, accurate localization of multiple transmitters is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface. To address these issues, we introduce clustering-based centroid correction methods that enhance robustness against density variations, and outliers. In addition, we propose two clusteringguided Residual Neural Networks, namely AngleNN for direction refinement and SizeNN for cluster size estimation. Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&amp;D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{git@github.com:rbalestr-lab/lejepa.git}{GitHub repo}).

Abstract: We introduce a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator that fundamentally reframes the discriminative approach. Instead of training a classifier to discriminate between joint and marginal distributions, we learn a normalizing flow that transforms one into the other. This technique produces a computationally efficient and precise MI estimate that scales well to high dimensions and across a wide range of ground-truth MI values.

<title>The Path Not Taken: RLVR Provably Learns Off the Principals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.
  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a class of neural networks that have received increased attention in recent literature. In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the "domain grid") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming key components in various mobile operating systems, driving smart applications like interactive chatbots and personal assistants. While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dual-technology scheduling in hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) networks that integrate Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) alongside Radio Frequency (RF). We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability.

Abstract: We study opportunistic optimal liquidation over fixed deadlines on BTC-USD limit-order books (LOB). We present RL-Exec, a PPO agent trained on historical replays augmented with endogenous transient impact (resilience), partial fills, maker/taker fees, and latency. The policy observes depth-20 LOB features plus microstructure indicators and acts under a sell-only inventory constraint to reach a residual target. Evaluation follows a strict time split (train: Jan-2020; test: Feb-2020) and a per-day protocol: for each test day we run ten independent start times and aggregate to a single daily score, avoiding pseudo-replication. We compare the agent to (i) TWAP and (ii) a VWAP-like baseline allocating using opposite-side order-book liquidity (top-20 levels), both executed on identical timestamps and costs. Statistical inference uses one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on daily RL-baseline differences with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction and bootstrap confidence intervals. On the Feb-2020 test set, RL-Exec significantly outperforms both baselines and the gap increases with the execution horizon (+2-3 bps at 30 min, +7-8 bps at 60 min, +23 bps at 120 min).

Abstract: Evaluating log summarization systems is challenging due to the lack of high-quality reference summaries and the limitations of existing metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, which depend on surface-level lexical overlap. We introduce REFLEX, a reference-free evaluation metric for log summarization based on large language model (LLM) judgment. REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics. REFLEX provides a scalable alternative for evaluating log summaries in real-world settings where reference data is scarce or unavailable.

Abstract: Cultural infrastructures, such as libraries, museums, theaters, and galleries, support learning, civic life, health, and local economies, yet access is uneven across cities. We present a novel, scalable, and open-data framework to measure spatial equity in cultural access. We map cultural infrastructures and compute a metric called Cultural Infrastructure Accessibility Score (CIAS) using exponential distance decay at fine spatial resolution, then aggregate the score per capita and integrate socio-demographic indicators. Interpretable tree-ensemble models with SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) are used to explain associations between accessibility, income, density, and tract-level racial/ethnic composition. Results show a pronounced core-periphery gradient, where non-library cultural infrastructures cluster near urban cores, while libraries track density and provide broader coverage. Non-library accessibility is modestly higher in higher-income tracts, and library accessibility is slightly higher in denser, lower-income areas.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

Abstract: We consider the maximization of $x^\top \theta$ over $(x,\theta) \in \mathcal{X} \times \Theta$, with $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ convex and $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ an ellipsoid. This problem is fundamental in linear bandits, as the learner must solve it at every time step using optimistic algorithms. We first show that for some sets $\mathcal{X}$ e.g. $\ell_p$ balls with $p>2$, no efficient algorithms exist unless $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$. We then provide two novel algorithms solving this problem efficiently when $\mathcal{X}$ is a centered ellipsoid. Our findings provide the first known method to implement optimistic algorithms for linear bandits in high dimensions.

Abstract: In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Active flow control of compressible transonic shock-boundary layer interactions over a two-dimensional RAE2822 airfoil at Re = 50,000 is investigated using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The flow field exhibits highly unsteady dynamics, including complex shock-boundary layer interactions, shock oscillations, and the generation of Kutta waves from the trailing edge. A high-fidelity CFD solver, employing a fifth-order spectral discontinuous Galerkin scheme in space and a strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (5,4) method in time, together with adaptive mesh refinement capability, is used to obtain the accurate flow field. Synthetic jet actuation is employed to manipulate these unsteady flow features, while the DRL agent autonomously discovers effective control strategies through direct interaction with high-fidelity compressible flow simulations. The trained controllers effectively mitigate shock-induced separation, suppress unsteady oscillations, and manipulate aerodynamic forces under transonic conditions. In the first set of experiments, aimed at both drag reduction and lift enhancement, the DRL-based control reduces the average drag coefficient by 13.78% and increases lift by 131.18%, thereby improving the lift-to-drag ratio by 121.52%, which underscores its potential for managing complex flow dynamics. In the second set, targeting drag reduction while maintaining lift, the DRL-based control achieves a 25.62% reduction in drag and a substantial 196.30% increase in lift, accompanied by markedly diminished oscillations. In this case, the lift-to-drag ratio improves by 220.26%.

Abstract: We present a variety of projection-based linear regression algorithms with a focus on modern machine-learning models and their algorithmic performance. We study the role of the relaxation parameter in generalized Kaczmarz algorithms and establish a priori regret bounds with explicit $\lambda$-dependence to quantify how much an algorithm's performance deviates from its optimal performance. A detailed analysis of relaxation parameter is also provided. Applications include: explicit regret bounds for the framework of Kaczmarz algorithm models, non-orthogonal Fourier expansions, and the use of regret estimates in modern machine learning models, including for noisy data, i.e., regret bounds for the noisy Kaczmarz algorithms. Motivated by machine-learning practice, our wider framework treats bounded operators (on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces), with updates realized as (block) Kaczmarz algorithms, leading to new and versatile results.

Abstract: Snowflake's Cortex AISQL is a production SQL engine that integrates native semantic operations directly into SQL. This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality. AISQL is deployed in production at Snowflake, where it powers diverse customer workloads across analytics, search, and content understanding.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design is a principled framework for conducting experiments that leverages Bayesian inference to quantify how much information one can expect to gain from selecting a certain design. However, accurate Bayesian inference relies on the assumption that one's statistical model of the data-generating process is correctly specified. If this assumption is violated, Bayesian methods can lead to poor inference and estimates of information gain. Generalised Bayesian (or Gibbs) inference is a more robust probabilistic inference framework that replaces the likelihood in the Bayesian update by a suitable loss function. In this work, we present Generalised Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (GBOED), an extension of Gibbs inference to the experimental design setting which achieves robustness in both design and inference. Using an extended information-theoretic framework, we derive a new acquisition function, the Gibbs expected information gain (Gibbs EIG). Our empirical results demonstrate that GBOED enhances robustness to outliers and incorrect assumptions about the outcome noise distribution.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) have emerged as an interpretable machine learning framework for discovering reaction kinetics directly from data, while strictly adhering to the Arrhenius and mass action laws. However, standard CRNNs cannot represent pressure-dependent rate behavior, which is critical in many combustion and chemical systems and typically requires empirical formulations such as Troe or PLOG. Here, we develop Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (KA-CRNNs) that generalize CRNNs by modeling each kinetic parameter as a learnable function of system pressure using Kolmogorov-Arnold activations. This structure maintains full interpretability and physical consistency while enabling assumption-free inference of pressure effects directly from data. A proof-of-concept study on the CH3 recombination reaction demonstrates that KA-CRNNs accurately reproduce pressure-dependent kinetics across a range of temperatures and pressures, outperforming conventional interpolative models. The framework establishes a foundation for data-driven discovery of extended kinetic behaviors in complex reacting systems, advancing interpretable and physics-consistent approaches for chemical model inference.

Abstract: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.

Abstract: The cost of error in many high-stakes settings is asymmetric: misdiagnosing pneumonia when absent is an inconvenience, but failing to detect it when present can be life-threatening. Because of this, artificial intelligence (AI) models used to assist such decisions are frequently trained with asymmetric loss functions that incorporate human decision-makers' trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. In two focal applications, we show that this standard alignment practice can backfire. In both cases, it would be better to train the machine learning model with a loss function that ignores the human's objective and then adjust predictions ex post according to that objective. We rationalize this result using an economic model of incentive design with endogenous information acquisition. The key insight from our theoretical framework is that machine classifiers perform not one but two incentivized tasks: choosing how to classify and learning how to classify. We show that while the adjustments engineers use correctly incentivize choosing, they can simultaneously reduce the incentives to learn. Our formal treatment of the problem reveals that methods embraced for their intuitive appeal can in fact misalign human and machine objectives in predictable ways.

Abstract: Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io

Abstract: While accelerated computing has transformed many domains of computing, its impact on logical reasoning, specifically Boolean satisfiability (SAT), remains limited. State-of-the-art SAT solvers rely heavily on inherently sequential conflict-driven search algorithms that offer powerful heuristics but limit the amount of parallelism that could otherwise enable significantly more scalable SAT solving. Inspired by neural network training, we formulate the SAT problem as a binarized matrix-matrix multiplication layer that could be optimized using a differentiable objective function. Enabled by this encoding, we combine the strengths of parallel differentiable optimization and sequential search to accelerate SAT on a hybrid GPU-CPU system. In this system, the GPUs leverage parallel differentiable solving to rapidly evaluate SAT clauses and use gradients to stochastically explore the solution space and optimize variable assignments. Promising partial assignments generated by the GPUs are post-processed on many CPU threads which exploit conflict-driven sequential search to further traverse the solution subspaces and identify complete assignments. Prototyping the hybrid solver on an NVIDIA DGX GB200 node, our solver achieves runtime speedups up to over 200x when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based solver on public satisfiable benchmark problems from the SAT Competition.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.

Abstract: Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in many tensor applications. In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.

Abstract: Securing Dew-Enabled Edge-of-Things (EoT) networks against sophisticated intrusions is a critical challenge. This paper presents HybridGuard, a framework that integrates machine learning and deep learning to improve intrusion detection. HybridGuard addresses data imbalance through mutual information based feature selection, ensuring that the most relevant features are used to improve detection performance, especially for minority attack classes. The framework leverages Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WCGAN-GP) to further reduce class imbalance and enhance detection precision. It adopts a two-phase architecture called DualNetShield to support advanced traffic analysis and anomaly detection, improving the granular identification of threats in complex EoT environments. HybridGuard is evaluated on the UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and IOTID20 datasets, where it demonstrates strong performance across diverse attack scenarios and outperforms existing solutions in adapting to evolving cybersecurity threats. This approach establishes HybridGuard as an effective tool for protecting EoT networks against modern intrusions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in machine learning, models have become increasingly capable of learning and making predictions in various industries. However, deploying these models in critical infrastructures presents a major challenge, as concerns about data privacy prevent unrestricted data sharing. Homomor- phic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data, but it remains incompatible with machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to their reliance on non-linear activation functions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes an optimized framework that replaces standard non-linear functions with homomorphically compatible approximations, ensuring secure computations while minimizing computational overhead. The proposed approach restructures the CNN architecture and introduces an efficient activation function approximation method to mitigate the performance trade-offs in- troduced by encryption. Experiments on CIFAR-10 achieve 94.4% accuracy with 2.42 s per single encrypted sample and 24,000 s per 10,000 encrypted samples, using a degree-4 polynomial and Softplus activation under CKKS, balancing accuracy and privacy.

Abstract: The sim-to-real gap, where agents trained in a simulator face significant performance degradation during testing, is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. Extansive works adopt the framework of distributionally robust RL, to learn a policy that acts robustly under worst case environment shift. Within this framework, our objective is to devise algorithms that are sample efficient with interactive data collection and large state spaces. By assuming d-rectangularity of environment dynamic shift, we identify a fundamental hardness result for learning in online Markov game, and address it by adopting minimum value assumption. Then, a novel least square value iteration type algorithm, DR-CCE-LSI, with exploration bonus devised specifically for multiple agents, is proposed to find an \episilon-approximate robust Coarse Correlated Equilibrium(CCE). To obtain sample efficient learning, we find that: when the feature mapping function satisfies certain properties, our algorithm, DR-CCE-LSI, is able to achieve \epsilon-approximate CCE with a regret bound of O{dHmin{H,1/min{\sigma_i}}\sqrt{K}}, where K is the number of interacting episodes, H is the horizon length, d is the feature dimension, and \simga_i represents the uncertainty level of player i. Our work introduces the first sample-efficient algorithm for this setting, matches the best result so far in single agent setting, and achieves minimax optimalsample complexity in terms of the feature dimension d. Meanwhile, we also conduct simulation study to validate the efficacy of our algorithm in learning a robust equilibrium.

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.

Abstract: We present parallel algorithms to accelerate sampling via counting in two settings: any-order autoregressive models and denoising diffusion models. An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\mu$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\mu$ is bounded.
  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\nu$ that approximates~$\mu$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\nu$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\mu$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\nu$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising path toward energy-efficient speech command recognition (SCR) by leveraging their event-driven processing paradigm. However, existing SNN-based SCR methods often struggle to capture rich temporal dependencies and contextual information from speech due to limited temporal modeling and binary spike-based representations. To address these challenges, we first introduce the multi-view spiking temporal-aware self-attention (MSTASA) module, which combines effective spiking temporal-aware attention with a multi-view learning framework to model complementary temporal dependencies in speech commands. Building on MSTASA, we further propose SpikCommander, a fully spike-driven transformer architecture that integrates MSTASA with a spiking contextual refinement channel MLP (SCR-MLP) to jointly enhance temporal context modeling and channel-wise feature integration. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), and the Google Speech Commands V2 (GSC). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikCommander consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN approaches with fewer parameters under comparable time steps, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency for robust speech command recognition.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Abstract: Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a promising candidate for next-generation nonvolatile memory (NVM) and in-memory computing applications. Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling.

<title>Class-feature Watermark: A Resilient Black-box Watermark Against Model Extraction Attacks</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property, yet remain vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEA), where adversaries replicate their functionality through black-box queries. Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.
  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has advanced significantly for the sake of deep-learning methods, while textual information further enhances its performance. However, few studies have focused on the physiological information during speech production, which also encompasses speaker traits, including emotional states. To bridge this gap, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the potential of the phonation excitation information and articulatory kinematics for SER. Due to the scarcity of training data for this purpose, we introduce a portrayed emotional dataset, STEM-E2VA, which includes audio and physiological data such as electroglottography (EGG) and electromagnetic articulography (EMA). EGG and EMA provide information of phonation excitation and articulatory kinematics, respectively. Additionally, we performed emotion recognition using estimated physiological data derived through inversion methods from speech, instead of collected EGG and EMA, to explore the feasibility of applying such physiological information in real-world SER. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating physiological information about speech production for SER and demonstrate its potential for practical use in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of generating synthetic data under differential privacy. To address the core limitations of marginal-based methods, we propose the Private Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network with Bayes Network Structure (PrAda-GAN), which integrates the strengths of both GAN-based and marginal-based approaches. Our method adopts a sequential generator architecture to capture complex dependencies among variables, while adaptively regularizing the learned structure to promote sparsity in the underlying Bayes network. Theoretically, we establish diminishing bounds on the parameter distance, variable selection error, and Wasserstein distance. Our analysis shows that leveraging dependency sparsity leads to significant improvements in convergence rates. Empirically, experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PrAda-GAN outperforms existing tabular data synthesis methods in terms of the privacy-utility trade-off.

<title>Prudential Reliability of Large Language Models in Reinsurance: Governance, Assurance, and Capital Efficiency</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

<title>Foam Segmentation in Wastewater Treatment Plants: A Federated Learning Approach with Segment Anything Model 2</title>

Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, while contributing to numerous success stories across various fields, faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive manual annotation. To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \textbf{B}alanced multi-\textbf{o}bjective \textbf{o}ptimization for \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{d}omain \textbf{a}daptation, termed \textbf{Boomda}. Extensive empirical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that Boomda outperforms the competing schemes.

Abstract: We revisit the fermion mass problem of the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory using machine learning techniques. The original $SU(5)$ model proposed by Georgi and Glashow is incompatible with the observed fermion mass spectrum. Two remedies are known to resolve this discrepancy, one is through introducing a new interaction via a 45-dimensional field, and the other via a 24-dimensional field. We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) requires efficient techniques for verifying their safety. DNN verifiers are complex tools, which might contain bugs that could compromise their soundness and undermine the reliability of the verification process. This concern can be mitigated using proofs: artifacts that are checkable by an external and reliable proof checker, and which attest to the correctness of the verification process. However, such proofs tend to be extremely large, limiting their use in many scenarios. In this work, we address this problem by minimizing proofs of unsatisfiability produced by DNN verifiers. We present algorithms that remove facts which were learned during the verification process, but which are unnecessary for the proof itself. Conceptually, our method analyzes the dependencies among facts used to deduce UNSAT, and removes facts that did not contribute. We then further minimize the proof by eliminating remaining unnecessary dependencies, using two alternative procedures. We implemented our algorithms on top of a proof producing DNN verifier, and evaluated them across several benchmarks. Our results show that our best-performing algorithm reduces proof size by 37%-82% and proof checking time by 30%-88%, while introducing a runtime overhead of 7%-20% to the verification process itself.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of enabling practitioners without quantum expertise to transition from classical to hybrid quantum-classical machine learning workflows. We propose a three-stage framework: starting with a classical self-training model, then introducing a minimal hybrid quantum variant, and finally applying diagnostic feedback via QMetric to refine the hybrid architecture. In experiments on the Iris dataset, the refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 in the classical approach to 0.87 in the quantum approach. These results suggest that even modest quantum components, when guided by proper diagnostics, can enhance class separation and representation capacity in hybrid learning, offering a practical pathway for classical machine learning practitioners to leverage quantum-enhanced methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers privacy preserving, distributed machine learning, allowing clients to contribute to a global model without revealing their local data. As models increasingly serve as monetizable digital assets, the ability to prove participation in their training becomes essential for establishing ownership. In this paper, we address this emerging need by introducing FedPoP, a novel FL framework that allows nonlinkable proof of participation while preserving client anonymity and privacy without requiring either extensive computations or a public ledger. FedPoP is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing secure aggregation protocols to ensure compatibility with real-world FL deployments. We provide a proof of concept implementation and an empirical evaluation under realistic client dropouts. In our prototype, FedPoP introduces 0.97 seconds of per-round overhead atop securely aggregated FL and enables a client to prove its participation/contribution to a model held by a third party in 0.0612 seconds. These results indicate FedPoP is practical for real-world deployments that require auditable participation without sacrificing privacy.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

Abstract: Radiative transfer is a fundamental process in astrophysics, essential for both interpreting observations and modeling thermal and dynamical feedback in simulations via ionizing radiation and photon pressure. However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.

Abstract: Reichel (2025) defined the Bariance as $\mathrm{Bariance}(x)=\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i<j}(x_i-x_j)^2$, which admits an $O(n)$ reformulation using scalar sums. We extend this to the covariance matrix by showing that $\mathrm{Cov}(X)=\frac{1}{n-1}\!\left(X^\top X-\frac{1}{n}\,s\,s^\top\right)$ with $s=X^\top \mathbf{1}_n$ is algebraically identical to the pairwise-difference form yet avoids explicit centering. Computation reduces to a single $p\times p$ outer matrix product and one subtraction. Empirical benchmarks in Python show clear runtime gains over numpy.cov in non-BLAS-tuned settings. Faster Gram routines such as RXTX (Rybin et. al) for $XX^\top$ further reduce total cost.

Abstract: Various neural network architectures are used in many of the state-of-the-art approaches for real-time nonlinear state estimation. With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Error Correction through Prompt Tuning for NL-to-SQL, leveraging the latest advancements in generative pre-training-based LLMs and RAG. Our work addresses the crucial need for efficient and accurate translation of natural language queries into SQL expressions in various settings with the growing use of natural language interfaces. We explore the evolution of NLIDBs from early rule-based systems to advanced neural network-driven approaches. Drawing inspiration from the medical diagnostic process, we propose a novel framework integrating an error correction mechanism that diagnoses error types, identifies their causes, provides fixing instructions, and applies these corrections to SQL queries. This approach is further enriched by embedding fine-tuning and RAG, which harnesses external knowledge bases for improved accuracy and transparency. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework achieves a significant 12 percent accuracy improvement over existing baselines, highlighting its potential to revolutionize data access and handling in contemporary data-driven environments.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring enables large-scale biodiversity assessment, but reliable classification of bioacoustic sounds requires not only high accuracy but also well-calibrated uncertainty estimates to ground decision-making. In bioacoustics, calibration is challenged by overlapping vocalisations, long-tailed species distributions, and distribution shifts between training and deployment data. The calibration of multi-label deep learning classifiers within the domain of bioacoustics has not yet been assessed. We systematically benchmark the calibration of four state-of-the-art multi-label bird sound classifiers on the BirdSet benchmark, evaluating both global, per-dataset and per-class calibration using threshold-free calibration metrics (ECE, MCS) alongside discrimination metrics (cmAP). Model calibration varies significantly across datasets and classes. While Perch v2 and ConvNeXt$_{BS}$ show better global calibration, results vary between datasets. Both models indicate consistent underconfidence, while AudioProtoPNet and BirdMAE are mostly overconfident. Surprisingly, calibration seems to be better for less frequent classes. Using simple post hoc calibration methods we demonstrate a straightforward way to improve calibration. A small labelled calibration set is sufficient to significantly improve calibration with Platt scaling, while global calibration parameters suffer from dataset variability. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and improving uncertainty calibration in bioacoustic classifiers.

Abstract: Learning-based inertial odometry has achieved remarkable progress in pedestrian navigation. However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-IONet in advancing accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms.

Abstract: This study investigates treatment effect estimation in the semi-supervised setting, where we can use not only the standard triple of covariates, treatment indicator, and outcome, but also unlabeled auxiliary covariates. For this problem, we develop efficiency bounds and efficient estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with the efficiency bound. In the analysis, we introduce two different data-generating processes: the one-sample setting and the two-sample setting. The one-sample setting considers the case where we can observe treatment indicators and outcomes for a part of the dataset, which is also called the censoring setting. In contrast, the two-sample setting considers two independent datasets with labeled and unlabeled data, which is also called the case-control setting or the stratified setting. In both settings, we find that by incorporating auxiliary covariates, we can lower the efficiency bound and obtain an estimator with an asymptotic variance smaller than that without such auxiliary covariates.

Abstract: Generative models, such as large language models or text-to-image diffusion models, can generate relevant responses to user-given queries. Response-based vector embeddings of generative models facilitate statistical analysis and inference on a given collection of black-box generative models. The Data Kernel Perspective Space embedding is one particular method of obtaining response-based vector embeddings for a given set of generative models, already discussed in the literature. In this paper, under appropriate regularity conditions, we establish high probability concentration bounds on the sample vector embeddings for a given set of generative models, obtained through the method of Data Kernel Perspective Space embedding. Our results tell us the required number of sample responses needed in order to approximate the population-level vector embeddings with a desired level of accuracy. The algebraic tools used to establish our results can be used further for establishing concentration bounds on Classical Multidimensional Scaling embeddings in general, when the dissimilarities are observed with noise.

Abstract: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are instrumental in many electronic design automation (EDA) tasks thanks to their compact representation of Boolean functions. In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the variable-ordering problem in BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis with a graph-based generative model and diversity-promoting decoding.

<title>Mitigating Negative Flips via Margin Preserving Training</title>

Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

<title>AgentPRM: Process Reward Models for LLM Agents via Step-Wise Promise and Progress</title>

Abstract: Despite rapid development, large language models (LLMs) still encounter challenges in multi-turn decision-making tasks (i.e., agent tasks) like web shopping and browser navigation, which require making a sequence of intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.

Abstract: To ensure that Machine Learning (ML) models can perform a robust detection and classification of cyberattacks, it is essential to train them with high-quality datasets with relevant features. However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.

Abstract: Point defects govern many important functional properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, resolving the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of these defects in multi-layer 2D materials remains a fundamental challenge, hindering rational defect engineering. Here, we overcome this limitation using an artificial intelligence-guided electron microscopy workflow to map the 3D topology and clustering of atomic vacancies in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene. Our approach reconstructs the 3D coordinates of vacancies across hundreds of thousands of lattice sites, generating robust statistical insight into their distribution that can be correlated with specific synthesis pathways. This large-scale data enables us to classify a hierarchy of defect structures--from isolated vacancies to nanopores--revealing their preferred formation and interaction mechanisms, as corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a generalizable framework for understanding and ultimately controlling point defects across large volumes, paving the way for the rational design of defect-engineered functional 2D materials.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

<title>An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization</title>

Abstract: Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\lceil\log_2 N\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.

<title>SOM Directions are Better than One: Multi-Directional Refusal Suppression in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

Abstract: We prove a fundamental misalignment in transfer learning: the source regularization that minimizes source risk almost never coincides with the regularization maximizing transfer benefit. Through sharp phase boundaries for L2-SP ridge regression, we characterize the transfer-optimal source penalty $\tau_0^*$ and show it diverges predictably from task-optimal values, requiring stronger regularization in high-SNR regimes and weaker regularization in low-SNR regimes. Additionally, in isotropic settings the decision to transfer is remarkably independent of target sample size and noise, depending only on task alignment and source characteristics. CIFAR-10 and MNIST experiments confirm this counterintuitive pattern persists in non-linear networks.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Semantic communications mark a paradigm shift from bit-accurate transmission toward meaning-centric communication, essential as wireless systems approach theoretical capacity limits. The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond.

Abstract: Safety in stochastic control systems, which are subject to random noise with a known probability distribution, aims to compute policies that satisfy predefined operational constraints with high confidence throughout the uncertain evolution of the state variables. The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution.

Abstract: Process-structure-property relationships are fundamental in materials science and engineering and are key to the development of new and improved materials. Symbolic regression serves as a powerful tool for uncovering mathematical models that describe these relationships. It can automatically generate equations to predict material behaviour under specific manufacturing conditions and optimize performance characteristics such as strength and elasticity.
  The present work illustrates how symbolic regression can derive constitutive models that describe the behaviour of various metallic alloys during plastic deformation. Constitutive modelling is a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between stress and strain in materials under different loading conditions. In this study, two materials (age-hardenable aluminium alloy and high-chromium martensitic steel) and two different testing methods (compression and tension) are considered to obtain the required stress-strain data. The results highlight the benefits of using symbolic regression while also discussing potential challenges.

Abstract: Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology and comparative performance analysis for the automated classification and object detection of peripheral blood cells (PBCs) in microscopic images. Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity and heterogeneity, robust data pipeline was first developed to standardize and merge four public datasets (PBC, BCCD, Chula, Sickle Cell) into a unified resource. Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. The results demonstrate that the Transfer Learning approach achieved significantly faster convergence and superior stability, culminating in a final validation loss of 0.08666, a substantial improvement over the baseline. This validated methodology establishes a robust foundation for building high-accuracy, deployable systems for automated hematological diagnosis.

Abstract: With increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and rising demand for network automation, autonomous cybersecurity mechanisms are becoming critical for securing modern networks. The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) adapted to financial domains often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of general reasoning capabilities essential for customer interactions and complex financial analysis. We introduce Selective Parameter Evaluation and Restoration via Model Merging (SPEAR-MM), a practical framework that preserves critical capabilities while enabling domain adaptation. Our method approximates layer-wise impact on external benchmarks through post-hoc analysis, then selectively freezes or restores transformer layers via spherical interpolation merging. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B for financial tasks, SPEAR-MM achieves 91.2% retention of general capabilities versus 69.7% for standard continual pretraining, while maintaining 94% of domain adaptation gains. The approach provides interpretable trade-off control and reduces computational costs by 90% crucial for resource-constrained financial institutions.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the dominant approach for answering questions over large corpora. However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP. Experiments with S-RAG on the newly introduced datasets, as well as on a public benchmark, demonstrate that it substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Mastering fine-grained visual recognition, essential in many expert domains, can require that specialists undergo years of dedicated training. Modeling the progression of such expertize in humans remains challenging, and accurately inferring a human learner's knowledge state is a key step toward understanding visual learning. We introduce CleverBirds, a large-scale knowledge tracing benchmark for fine-grained bird species recognition. Collected by the citizen-science platform eBird, it offers insight into how individuals acquire expertize in complex fine-grained classification. More than 40,000 participants have engaged in the quiz, answering over 17 million multiple-choice questions spanning over 10,000 bird species, with long-range learning patterns across an average of 400 questions per participant. We release this dataset to support the development and evaluation of new methods for visual knowledge tracing. We show that tracking learners' knowledge is challenging, especially across participant subgroups and question types, with different forms of contextual information offering varying degrees of predictive benefit. CleverBirds is among the largest benchmark of its kind, offering a substantially higher number of learnable concepts. With it, we hope to enable new avenues for studying the development of visual expertize over time and across individuals.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

<title>Think-at-Hard: Selective Latent Iterations to Improve Reasoning Language Models</title>

Abstract: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/TaH.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

Abstract: Developing efficient and accurate visuomotor policies poses a central challenge in robotic imitation learning. While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning. Code is available on https://github.com/RongXueZoe/SeFA.

Abstract: Neural networks are widespread due to their powerful performance. Yet, they degrade in the presence of noisy labels at training time. Inspired by the setting of learning with expert advice, where multiplicative weights (MW) updates were recently shown to be robust to moderate data corruptions in expert advice, we propose to use MW for reweighting examples during neural networks optimization. We theoretically establish the convergence of our method when used with gradient descent and prove its advantages in 1d cases. We then validate empirically our findings for the general case by showing that MW improves neural networks' accuracy in the presence of label noise on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M. We also show the impact of our approach on adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Imperfect Information Games (IIGs) offer robust models for scenarios where decision-makers face uncertainty or lack complete information. Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) has been one of the most successful family of algorithms for tackling IIGs. The integration of skill-based strategy learning with CFR could potentially mirror more human-like decision-making process and enhance the learning performance for complex IIGs. It enables the learning of a hierarchical strategy, wherein low-level components represent skills for solving subgames and the high-level component manages the transition between skills. In this paper, we introduce the first hierarchical version of Deep CFR (HDCFR), an innovative method that boosts learning efficiency in tasks involving extensively large state spaces and deep game trees. A notable advantage of HDCFR over previous works is its ability to facilitate learning with predefined (human) expertise and foster the acquisition of skills that can be transferred to similar tasks. To achieve this, we initially construct our algorithm on a tabular setting, encompassing hierarchical CFR updating rules and a variance-reduced Monte Carlo sampling extension. Notably, we offer the theoretical justifications, including the convergence rate of the proposed updating rule, the unbiasedness of the Monte Carlo regret estimator, and ideal criteria for effective variance reduction. Then, we employ neural networks as function approximators and develop deep learning objectives to adapt our proposed algorithms for large-scale tasks, while maintaining the theoretical support.

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has increased attention to pruning neural networks at initialization. We study this problem in the linear setting. We show that finding a sparse mask at initialization is equivalent to the sketching problem introduced for efficient matrix multiplication. This gives us tools to analyze the LTH problem and gain insights into it. Specifically, using the mask found at initialization, we bound the approximation error of the pruned linear model at the end of training. We theoretically justify previous empirical evidence that the search for sparse networks may be data independent. By using the sketching perspective, we suggest a generic improvement to existing algorithms for pruning at initialization, which we show to be beneficial in the data-independent case.

Abstract: The backpropagation algorithm remains the dominant and most successful method for training deep neural networks (DNNs). At the same time, training DNNs at scale comes at a significant computational cost and therefore a high carbon footprint. Converging evidence suggests that input decorrelation may speed up deep learning. However, to date, this has not yet translated into substantial improvements in training efficiency in large-scale DNNs. This is mainly caused by the challenge of enforcing fast and stable network-wide decorrelation. Here, we show for the first time that much more efficient training of deep convolutional neural networks is feasible by embracing decorrelated backpropagation as a mechanism for learning. To achieve this goal we made use of a novel algorithm which induces network-wide input decorrelation using minimal computational overhead. By combining this algorithm with careful optimizations, we achieve a more than two-fold speed-up and higher test accuracy compared to backpropagation when training several deep residual networks. This demonstrates that decorrelation provides exciting prospects for efficient deep learning at scale.

Abstract: We present ElastoGen, a knowledge-driven AI model that generates physically accurate 4D elastodynamics. Unlike deep models that learn from video- or image-based observations, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics and learns from established mathematical and optimization procedures. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the differential equation, corresponding to the nonlinear force equilibrium, into a series of iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit deep architectures. We carefully build our network module following this overarching design philosophy. ElastoGen is much more lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale than deep generative models. Because of its alignment with actual physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.

Abstract: On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method for the solution of high-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction equations with periodic boundary conditions. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling in discrete domains, yet efficiently sampling from these models remains challenging. Existing sampling strategies often struggle to balance computation and sample quality when the number of sampling steps is reduced, even when the model has learned the data distribution well. To address these limitations, we propose a predictor-corrector sampling scheme where the corrector is informed by the diffusion model to more reliably counter the accumulating approximation errors. To further enhance the effectiveness of our informed corrector, we introduce complementary architectural modifications based on hollow transformers and a simple tailored training objective that leverages more training signal. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the failure modes of existing samplers and show how informed correctors alleviate these problems. On the text8 and tokenized ImageNet 256x256 datasets, our informed corrector consistently produces superior samples with fewer errors or improved FID scores for discrete diffusion models. These results underscore the potential of informed correctors for fast and high-fidelity generation using discrete diffusion. Our code is available at https://github.com/lindermanlab/informed-correctors.

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control system modeled as an ordinary differential equation subject to disturbance, with a state feedback controller parameterized as a feedforward neural network. We propose a framework for training controllers with certified robust forward invariant polytopes, where any trajectory initialized inside the polytope remains within the polytope, regardless of the disturbance. First, we parameterize a family of lifted control systems in a higher dimensional space, where the original neural controlled system evolves on an invariant subspace of each lifted system. We use interval analysis and neural network verifiers to further construct a family of lifted embedding systems, carefully capturing the knowledge of this invariant subspace. If the vector field of any lifted embedding system satisfies a sign constraint at a single point, then a certain convex polytope of the original system is robustly forward invariant. Treating the neural network controller and the lifted system parameters as variables, we propose an algorithm to train controllers with certified forward invariant polytopes in the closed-loop control system. Through two examples, we demonstrate how the simplicity of the sign constraint allows our approach to scale with system dimension to over $50$ states, and outperform state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based sampling approaches in runtime.

Abstract: Offline RL is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our ``RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three target tracking tasks in a challenging, stochastic tokamak control simulator.

Abstract: While transformers have been at the core of most recent advancements in sequence generative models, their computational cost remains quadratic in sequence length. Several subquadratic architectures have been proposed to address this computational issue. Some of them, including long convolution sequence models (LCSMs), such as Hyena, address this issue at training time but remain quadratic during inference. We propose a method for speeding up LCSMs' exact inference to quasilinear $O(L\log^2L)$ time, identify the key properties that make this possible, and propose a general framework that exploits these. Our approach, inspired by previous work on relaxed polynomial interpolation, is based on a tiling which helps decrease memory movement and share computation. It has the added benefit of allowing for almost complete parallelization across layers of the position-mixing part of the architecture. Empirically, we provide a proof of concept implementation for Hyena, which gets up to $7.8\times$ end-to-end improvement over standard inference by improving $110\times$ within the position-mixing part.

Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Ubiquitous mobile devices have catalyzed the development of vehicle crowd sensing (VCS). In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in the flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors under diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased coverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To achieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally relocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions and target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a two-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time vehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation strategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to suboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream prediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep learning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the task-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error. Methodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic programming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to compute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by real-world taxi datasets in Hong Kong. Utilizing the alternating differentiation method, the general SPO framework presents a novel concept of addressing decision-making problems with uncertainty, demonstrating significant potential for advancing applications in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: We introduce a new method for clustering based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs). The new method addresses the limitations of RK-CCDs by employing a new variant of spatial randomness test that employs the nearest neighbor distance (NND) instead of the Ripley's K function used by RK-CCDs. We conduct a comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis to assess the performance of our method, considering factors such as dimensionality, data set size, number of clusters, cluster volumes, and inter-cluster distance. Our method is particularly effective for high-dimensional data sets, comparable to or outperforming KS-CCDs and RK-CCDs that rely on a KS-type statistic or the Ripley's K function. We also evaluate our methods using real and complex data sets, comparing them to well-known clustering methods. Again, our methods exhibit competitive performance, producing high-quality clusters with desirable properties.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for the transparency and clinical adoption of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). However, the real-world effectiveness of existing XAI methods remains limited and is inconsistently evaluated. This study conducts a systematic PRISMA-guided survey of 31 human-centered evaluations (HCE) of XAI applied to CDSS, classifying them by XAI methodology, evaluation design, and adoption barrier. Our findings reveal that most existing studies employ post-hoc, model-agnostic approaches such as SHAP and Grad-CAM, typically assessed through small-scale clinician studies. The results show that over 80% of the studies adopt post-hoc, model-agnostic approaches such as SHAP and Grad-CAM, and that clinician sample sizes remain below 25 participants. The findings indicate that explanations generally improve clinician trust and diagnostic confidence, but frequently increase cognitive load and exhibit misalignment with domain reasoning processes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a stakeholder-centric evaluation framework that integrates socio-technical principles and human-computer interaction to guide the future development of clinically viable and trustworthy XAI-based CDSS.

Abstract: Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results. However, when the data dimensionality increases, existing models tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler, non-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in high-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the distribution accurately. To mitigate the insufficient learning signals and to stabilize training under such conditions, we propose CtrTab, a condition-controlled diffusion model that injects perturbed ground-truth samples as auxiliary inputs during training. This design introduces an implicit L2 regularization on the model's sensitivity to the control signal, improving robustness and stability in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with a performance gap in accuracy over 90% on average.

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), we often need to choose one among hundreds of trained ML models at hand, based on various objectives such as accuracy, robustness, fairness or scalability. However, it is often unclear how to compare, aggregate and, ultimately, trade-off these objectives, making it a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge, as objectives may be measured in different units and scales. In this work, we investigate how objectives can be automatically normalized and aggregated to systematically help the user navigate their Pareto front. To this end, we make incomparable objectives comparable using their cumulative functions, approximated by their relative rankings. As a result, our proposed approach, COPA, can aggregate them while matching user-specific preferences, allowing practitioners to meaningfully navigate and search for models in the Pareto front. We demonstrate the potential impact of COPA in both model selection and benchmarking tasks across diverse ML areas such as fair ML, domain generalization, AutoML and foundation models, where classical ways to normalize and aggregate objectives fall short.

Abstract: Machine learning solutions are rapidly adopted to enable a variety of key use cases, from conversational AI assistants to scientific discovery. This growing adoption is expected to increase the associated lifecycle carbon footprint, including both \emph{operational carbon} from training and inference and \emph{embodied carbon} from AI hardware manufacturing. We introduce \ourframework -- the first carbon-aware co-optimization framework for Transformer-based models and hardware accelerators. By integrating both operational and embodied carbon into early-stage design space exploration, \ourframework enables sustainability-driven model architecture and hardware accelerator co-design that reveals fundamentally different trade-offs than latency- or energy-centric approaches. Evaluated across a range of Transformer models, \ourframework consistently demonstrates the potential to reduce total carbon emissions -- by up to 30\% -- while maintaining accuracy and latency. We further highlight its extensibility through a focused case study on multi-modal models. Our results emphasize the need for holistic optimization methods that prioritize carbon efficiency without compromising model capability and execution time performance. The source code of \ourframework is available at {\small{\href{https://github.com/facebookresearch/CATransformers}{\texttt{https://github.com/facebookresearch/CATransformers}}}}.

Abstract: Coastal flooding poses increasing threats to communities worldwide, necessitating accurate and hyper-local inundation forecasting for effective emergency response. However, real-world deployment of forecasting systems is often constrained by sparse sensor networks, where only a limited subset of locations may have sensors due to budget constraints. To approach this challenge, we present DIFF -SPARSE, a masked conditional diffusion model designed for probabilistic coastal inundation forecasting from sparse sensor observations. DIFF -SPARSE primarily utilizes the inundation history of a location and its neighboring locations from a context time window as spatiotemporal context. The fundamental challenge of spatiotemporal prediction based on sparse observations in the context window is addressed by introducing a novel masking strategy during training. Digital elevation data and temporal co-variates are utilized as additional spatial and temporal contexts, respectively. A convolutional neural network and a conditional UNet architecture with cross-attention mechanism are employed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested DIFF -SPARSE on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia and systematically assessed the performance of DIFF -SPARSE across different sparsity levels 0%, 50%, 95% missing observations. Our experiment results show that DIFF -SPARSE achieves upto 62% improvement in terms of two forecasting performance metrics compared to existing methods, at 95% sparsity level. Moreover, our ablation studies reveal that digital elevation data becomes more useful at high sparsity levels compared to temporal co-variates.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for visual policy learning that leverages differentiable simulation and first-order analytical policy gradients. Our approach decouple the rendering process from the computation graph, enabling seamless integration with existing differentiable simulation ecosystems without the need for specialized differentiable rendering software. This decoupling not only reduces computational and memory overhead but also effectively attenuates the policy gradient norm, leading to more stable and smoother optimization. We evaluate our method on standard visual control benchmarks using modern GPU-accelerated simulation. Experiments show that our approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time and consistently outperforms all baseline methods in terms of final returns. Notably, on complex tasks such as humanoid locomotion, our method achieves a $4\times$ improvement in final return, and successfully learns a humanoid running policy within 4 hours on a single GPU.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes.

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work, we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval, and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

<title>RL in Name Only? Analyzing the Structural Assumptions in RL post-training for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Concentration of distances in high dimension is an important factor for the development and design of stable and reliable data analysis algorithms. In this paper, we address the fundamental long-standing question about the concentration of distances in high dimension for fractional quasi $p$-norms, $p\in(0,1)$. The topic has been at the centre of various theoretical and empirical controversies. Here we, for the first time, identify conditions when fractional quasi $p$-norms concentrate and when they don't. We show that contrary to some earlier suggestions, for broad classes of distributions, fractional quasi $p$-norms admit exponential and uniform in $p$ concentration bounds. For these distributions, the results effectively rule out previously proposed approaches to alleviate concentration by "optimal" setting the values of $p$ in $(0,1)$. At the same time, we specify conditions and the corresponding families of distributions for which one can still control concentration rates by appropriate choices of $p$. We also show that in an arbitrarily small vicinity of a distribution from a large class of distributions for which uniform concentration occurs, there are uncountably many other distributions featuring anti-concentration properties. Importantly, this behavior enables devising relevant data encoding or representation schemes favouring or discouraging distance concentration. The results shed new light on this long-standing problem and resolve the tension around the topic in both theory and empirical evidence reported in the literature.

Abstract: The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random variable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in machine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining the tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of the random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to construct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very successful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching the rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting, these approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with strong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no betting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2\log\frac1\delta}{n}})$ width of the confidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a betting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically outperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in every step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a constant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict improvements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of Hoeffding or Bernstein. Moreover, we also prove that the width of our confidence intervals is optimal up to an $1+o(1)$ factor diminishing with $n$. The code is available at https://github.com/vvoracek/STaR-bets-confidence-interval.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss (NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$; the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance in practice.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point, but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions. Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data, knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC, exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end training time, and memory usage.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) in the presence of distributional mismatch between training and deployment, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions, and thereby reliable guarantees on real-world performance are essential. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment-assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study a more practical and challenging setting: online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while seeking policies that are robust with respect to an uncertainty set around this nominal model. We consider general $f$-divergence-based ambiguity sets, including $\chi^2$ and KL divergence balls, and design a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret for the robust control objective under minimal assumptions, without requiring generative or offline data access. Moreover, we establish a corresponding minimax lower bound on the regret of any online algorithm, demonstrating the near-optimality of our method. Experiments across diverse environments with model misspecification show that our approach consistently improves worst-case performance and aligns with the theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design, leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption, achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject) demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA) decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution for AAD tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (SARM), a novel architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at https://github.com/schrieffer-z/sarm.

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2 times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator (STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the efficiency of STE.

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance for mobile devices.

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot generalization across a broad class of PDEs without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE parameterizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we introduce an iterative refinement procedure that treats the residual of the generated PINN as "delta PDE" and performs another forward pass to generate a corrective PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six benchmarks and achieves a >100x lower $L_2$ loss in the best case, while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS, several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity. By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model. This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a priori unknown.

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model. The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks. Code to reproduce all experiments is available at github.com/Diegogpcm/pacbayesgradients.

Abstract: This paper studies policy transfer, one of the well-known transfer learning techniques adopted in large language models, for two classes of continuous-time reinforcement learning problems. In the first class of continuous-time linear-quadratic systems with Shannon's entropy regularization (a.k.a. LQRs), we fully exploit the Gaussian structure of their optimal policy and the stability of their associated Riccati equations. In the second class where the system has possibly non-linear and bounded dynamics, the key technical component is the stability of diffusion SDEs which is established by invoking the rough path theory. Our work provides the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL: an optimal policy learned for one RL problem can be used to initialize the search for a near-optimal policy in a closely related RL problem, while maintaining the convergence rate of the original algorithm.
  To illustrate the benefit of policy transfer for RL, we propose a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs, which achieves global linear convergence and local super-linear convergence. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a concrete class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere, we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN, Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT -- revealing how they influence clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly effective choice.

Abstract: How should a player who repeatedly plays a game against a no-regret learner strategize to maximize his utility? We study this question and show that under some mild assumptions, the player can always guarantee himself a utility of at least what he would get in a Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. When the no-regret learner has only two actions, we show that the player cannot get any higher utility than the Stackelberg equilibrium utility. But when the no-regret learner has more than two actions and plays a mean-based no-regret strategy, we show that the player can get strictly higher than the Stackelberg equilibrium utility. We provide a characterization of the optimal game-play for the player against a mean-based no-regret learner as a solution to a control problem. When the no-regret learner's strategy also guarantees him a no-swap regret, we show that the player cannot get anything higher than a Stackelberg equilibrium utility.

Abstract: Streamflow prediction is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology due to the complex interplay between multiple non-linear physical mechanisms behind streamflow generation. While physics based models are rooted in rich understanding of the physical processes, a significant performance gap still remains which can be potentially addressed by leveraging the recent advances in machine learning. The goal of this work is to incorporate our understanding of hydrological processes and constraints into machine learning algorithms to improve the predictive performance. Traditional ML models for this problem predict streamflow using weather drivers as input. However there are multiple intermediate processes that interact to generate streamflow from weather drivers. The key idea of the approach is to explicitly model these intermediate processes that connect weather drivers to streamflow using a multi-task learning framework. While our proposed approach requires data about intermediate processes during training, only weather drivers will be needed to predict the streamflow during testing phase. We assess the efficacy of the approach on a simulation dataset generated by the SWAT model for a catchment located in the South Branch of the Root River Watershed in southeast Minnesota. While the focus of this paper is on improving the performance given data from a single catchment, methodology presented here is applicable to ML-based approaches that use data from multiple catchments to improve performance of each individual catchment.

Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.

Abstract: Differentiable physical simulators are proving to be valuable tools for developing data-driven models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent work has explored using LLMs to rate and select data based on a small set of human-designed criteria (rules), but these approaches often rely heavily on heuristics, lack principled metrics for rule evaluation, and generalize poorly to new tasks. We propose a novel rule-based data selection framework that introduces a metric based on the orthogonality of rule score vectors to evaluate and select complementary rules. Our automated pipeline first uses LLMs to generate diverse rules covering multiple aspects of data quality, then rates samples according to these rules and applies the determinantal point process (DPP) to select the most independent rules. These rules are then used to score the full dataset, and high-scoring samples are selected for downstream tasks such as LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework in two experiment setups: (1) alignment with ground-truth ratings and (2) performance of LLMs fine-tuned on the selected data. Experiments across IMDB, Medical, Math, and Code domains demonstrate that our DPP-based rule selection consistently improves both rating accuracy and downstream model performance over strong baselines.

Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel, outlyingness scores (OSs) based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs): Outbound Outlyingness Score (OOS) and Inbound Outlyingness Score (IOS). These scores enhance the interpretability of outlier detection results. Both OSs employ graph-, density-, and distribution-based techniques, tailored to high-dimensional data with varying cluster shapes and intensities. OOS evaluates the outlyingness of a point relative to its nearest neighbors, while IOS assesses the total ``influence" a point receives from others within its cluster. Both OSs effectively identify global and local outliers, invariant to data collinearity. Moreover, IOS is robust to the masking problems. With extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the performance of both OSs with CCD-based, traditional, and state-of-the-art outlier detection methods. Both OSs exhibit substantial overall improvements over the CCD-based methods in both artificial and real-world data sets, particularly with IOS, which delivers the best overall performance among all the methods, especially in high-dimensional settings.
  Keywords: Outlier detection, Outlyingness score, Graph-based clustering, Cluster catch digraphs, High-dimensional data.

Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.

Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring including photoplethysmography (PPG) provides non-invasive cardiac and respiratory measurements, yet motion artefacts (MAs) during physical activity degrade its signal quality and downstream estimation concurrently. An attention-mechanism-based generative adversarial network (AM-GAN) was proposed to model motion artefacts and mitigate their impact on raw PPG signals. The AM-GAN learns how to transform motion-affected PPG into artefact-reduced waveforms to align with triaxial acceleration signals corresponding to artefact components gained from a triaxial accelerometer. The AM-GAN has been validated across four experimental protocols with 43 participants performing activities from low to high intensity (6--12km/h). With the public datasets, the AM-GAN achieves mean absolute error (MAE) for heart rate (HR) of 1.81 beats/min on IEEE-SPC and 3.86 beats/min on PPGDalia. On the in-house LU dataset, it shows the MAEs < 1.37 beats/min for HR and 2.49 breaths/min for respiratory rate (RR). A further in-house C2 dataset with three oxygen levels (16%, 18%, and 21%) was applied in the AM-GAN to attain a MAE of 1.65% for SpO2. The outcome demonstrates that the AM-GAN offers a robust and reliable physiological estimation under various intensities of physical activity.

Abstract: The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via adaptively truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent Goursat PDEs via adaptively truncated local power series expansions and recursive propagation of boundary conditions along a directed graph in a topological ordering. This method strikes an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy, achieving substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel. It offers (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (one million data points or more) on a single GPU. As demonstrated in our benchmarks, these advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications involving very long and highly volatile sequential data.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to enhance factual correctness and domain coverage. Modern RAG pipelines rely on large datastores, creating a significant system challenge: achieving high throughput and low latency is difficult, especially when GPU memory is limited. To address these challenges, we propose TeleRAG, an efficient inference system that reduces latency and improves throughput with minimal GPU memory requirements. The core innovation of TeleRAG is lookahead retrieval, a prefetching mechanism that predicts required data and transfers them from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM generation. In addition, TeleRAG adopts a prefetching scheduler and a cache-aware scheduler to support efficient multi-GPU inference with minimal overhead. Evaluations show TeleRAG achieves up to a 1.53x average end-to-end latency reduction (single-query) and 1.83x higher average throughput (batched), as well as good scalability in throughput. This confirms the practical utility of TeleRAG for faster and more memory-efficient deployments of RAG applications.

Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.

Abstract: Multi-environment (M-En) networks integrate diverse traffic sources, including Internet of Things (IoT) and traditional computing systems, creating complex and evolving conditions for malicious traffic detection. Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning. E.g. they can fail to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to make simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to generalize factual information from fine-tuning can significantly hinder the reasoning capabilities of these models. On the other hand, language models' in-context learning (ICL) shows different inductive biases and deductive reasoning capabilities. Here, we explore these differences in generalization and deductive reasoning between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' abilities to make generalizations over factual information from novel data. These datasets are designed to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either through ICL or fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, ICL can generalize several types of inferences more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context reasoning traces to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the generalization afforded by different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot RL (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface integrates easily with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) strengthens statistical learning under model uncertainty by minimizing the local worst-case risk within a prescribed ambiguity set. Although WDRO has been extensively studied in parametric settings, its theoretical properties in nonparametric frameworks remain underexplored. This paper investigates WDRO for nonparametric regression. We first establish a structural distinction based on the order $k$ of the Wasserstein distance, showing that $k=1$ induces Lipschitz-type regularization, whereas $k > 1$ corresponds to gradient-norm regularization. To address model misspecification, we analyze the excess local worst-case risk, deriving non-asymptotic error bounds for estimators constructed using norm-constrained feedforward neural networks. This analysis is supported by new covering number and approximation bounds that simultaneously control both the function and its gradient. The proposed estimator achieves a convergence rate of $n^{-2\beta/(d+2\beta)}$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\beta$ depends on the target's smoothness and network parameters. This rate is shown to be minimax optimal under conditions commonly satisfied in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, these bounds on the excess local worst-case risk imply guarantees on the excess natural risk, ensuring robustness against any distribution within the ambiguity set. We show the framework's generality across regression and classification problems. Simulation studies and an application to the MNIST dataset further illustrate the estimator's robustness.

<title>HAPO: Training Language Models to Reason Concisely via History-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11225</link>

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

<title>Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models have gained increasing popularity in mitigating this issue, due to the strong generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity, resulting in inferior performance. To address this limitation, we propose Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition of the gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients onto these subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the optimization subspace of each task is constrained to be orthogonal to the historical task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component that captures the critical update directions for the current task. Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task sequences.

Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of {Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.

<title>A Unified and Fast-Sampling Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.21528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches often produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified and fast-sampling framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). We reformulate the problem through an SOC-based optimization, proving that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. To avoid computationally expensive costs of iterative Euler sampling methods in UniDB, we design a training-free accelerated algorithm by deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDE. It is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes, effectively reducing error accumulation. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework, bridging the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency. Our code is available online https://github.com/2769433owo/UniDB-plusplus.

arXiv:2505.21872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs. Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.

<title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>

Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.

Abstract: The public often attributes human-like qualities to large language models (LLMs) and assumes they "know" certain things. In reality, LLMs encode information retained during training as internal probabilistic knowledge. This study examines existing methods for probing the veracity of that knowledge and identifies several flawed underlying assumptions. To address these flaws, we introduce sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a multiclass probing framework that combines multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction. sAwMIL leverages internal activations of LLMs to classify statements as true, false, or neither. We evaluate sAwMIL across 16 open-source LLMs, including default and chat-based variants, on three new curated datasets. Our results show that (1) common probing methods fail to provide a reliable and transferable veracity direction and, in some settings, perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) truth and falsehood are not encoded symmetrically; and (3) LLMs encode a third type of signal that is distinct from both true and false.

<title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>

arXiv:2507.05550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to handle images, videos, and audio by incorporating feature extractors and projection modules. However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper reviews works that advance agentic applications and architectures, including initial efforts with GPT-style interfaces and more complex systems where AI agents function as coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given sample and query access to finite set of candidate distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples from an unknown distribution $P$, both over a domain $\mathcal{X}$. The goal is to output a distribution $Q$ whose distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$. Specifically, if the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output $Q$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$. The optimal approximation for proper algorithms (where $Q \in \mathcal{H}$) is $C=3$ using $\Theta(\log(n/\delta)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from $P$ and for improper algorithms (where $Q$ is not necessarily in $\mathcal{H}$) is $C=2$ using $\tilde{\Theta}(\log(n/\delta)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from $P$.
  In the improper setting, the algorithm achieving $C=2$ [Bousquet, Braverman, Kol, Efremenko, Moran, FOCS 2021] runs in time which grows polynomially with $|\mathcal{X}|$ -- it does not run in finite time for real-valued distributions. A promising path towards improved runtime is to consider improper algorithms which output a mixture $Q$ of the hypotheses as such a distribution can be represented in $n$ words of memory. We show (1) a lower bound that no algorithm which outputs a mixture can achieve approximation better than $C = 3-2/n$ unless the number of samples is polynomial in $|\mathcal{X}|$, as well as (2) an algorithm which runs in time $\text{poly}(n)$ and achieves the same approximation guarantee.
  In the proper setting, [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided an algorithm with $C=3$ running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$, significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel element-wise subset selection method for the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, focusing on low-rank matrix factorization involving matrices with missing values, as commonly encountered in recommender systems. While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.

Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.

arXiv:2509.22242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

<title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

<title>Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>

arXiv:2510.26656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

<title>GUI-AIMA: Aligning Intrinsic Multimodal Attention with a Context Anchor for GUI Grounding</title>

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 59.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 63.8% on OSWorld-G and 91.5% on ScreenSpot-v2.

<title>The Adaptivity Barrier in Batched Nonparametric Bandits: Sharp Characterization of the Price of Unknown Margin</title>

arXiv:2511.03708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study batched nonparametric contextual bandits under a margin condition when the margin parameter $\alpha$ is unknown. To capture the statistical cost of this ignorance, we introduce the regret inflation criterion, defined as the ratio between the regret of an adaptive algorithm and that of an oracle knowing $\alpha$. We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomially with the horizon $T$, with exponent given by the value of a convex optimization problem that depends on the dimension, smoothness, and number of batches $M$. Moreover, the minimizer of this optimization problem directly prescribes the batch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm. Building on this principle, we develop RoBIN (RObust batched algorithm with adaptive BINning), which achieves the optimal regret inflation up to polylogarithmic factors. These results reveal a new adaptivity barrier: under batching, adaptation to an unknown margin parameter inevitably incurs a polynomial penalty, sharply characterized by a variational problem. Remarkably, this barrier vanishes once the number of batches exceeds order $\log \log T$; with only a doubly logarithmic number of updates, one can recover the oracle regret rate up to polylogarithmic factors.

<div> Controlled data collection, Feedback mechanism, Dataset diversity, Reducing redundancy, Data-centric AI<br />
Summary: 
Modern AI systems often face constraints not in model capacity but in data quality and diversity. The traditional open-loop data collection approach leads to inefficiencies in storage, labeling, and generalization. This paper introduces Feedback Control Data Collection (FCDC), which treats data collection as a closed-loop control problem. FCDC uses an online probabilistic model to approximate data distribution and adjusts sample retention based on feedback signals like likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. This approach balances exploration and exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy accumulation. Experimental results show that FCDC produces more balanced datasets by 25.9% and reduces data storage by 39.8%. FCDC demonstrates that data collection can be actively controlled, transforming it from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To address this, this paper introduces Feedback Control Data Collection (FCDC), a paradigm that formulates data collection as a closed-loop control problem. FCDC continuously approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from accumulating over time. In addition to demonstrating the controllability of FCDC on a synthetic dataset that converges toward a uniform distribution under Gaussian input assumption, experiments on real data streams show that FCDC produces more balanced datasets by 25.9% while reducing data storage by 39.8%. These results demonstrate that data collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.

<div> Keywords: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, LoRA, DoRA, Pre-Diag, SORA

Summary:
The study focuses on improving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly examining the DoRA approach. It is revealed that DoRA succeeds by increasing the singular value entropy of weight updates, leading to a more uniform distribution akin to full fine-tuning. This insight allows for the reformulation of DoRA into a more efficient matrix form, identifying it as a learnable weight conditioning method. A unified framework is proposed for designing advanced PEFT methods by exploring conditioning matrix placement and type. Two new methods, Pre-Diag and SORA, are introduced within this framework. Pre-Diag efficiently calibrates pre-trained weights before LoRA updates, enhancing performance and reducing training time. SORA employs parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation for a more powerful transformation of the feature space. Extensive experiments on language tasks demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to LoRA and DoRA.<br /><br />Summary: The study delves into enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, dissecting DoRA's success, reformulating it for efficiency, and proposing new methods within a unified framework for superior performance on language tasks. <div>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting large pre-trained models. Among these, LoRA is considered a foundational approach. Building on this, the influential DoRA method enhances performance by decomposing weight updates into magnitude and direction. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear, and it introduces significant computational overhead. In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success stems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight update matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full fine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more efficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method. Based on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced PEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural placement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this framework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies a diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate the pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training time; and (2) \textbf{S}kewed \textbf{O}rthogonal \textbf{R}otation \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient orthogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation of the feature space. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior performance and efficiency compared to both LoRA and DoRA.

Summary: 
This study explores how the brain processes language by comparing EEG signals with speech embeddings from pre-trained models. Researchers investigate which layers of models like wav2vec2 and CLIP best reflect brain processing during speech perception. Using ridge regression and contrastive decoding, they test different strategies such as individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. The results suggest that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations can enhance our understanding of how the brain interprets language as more than just sound, but as a holistic experience. <div>

Abstract: When we hear the word "house", we don't just process sound, we imagine walls, doors, memories. The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw acoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on recent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech embeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best reflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two models: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words to images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how these embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and contrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation. The findings suggest that combining multimodal, layer-aware representations may bring us closer to decoding how the brain understands language, not just as sound, but as experience.

Summary: 

The article discusses the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance language models' reasoning and generalization abilities, particularly in tool-agnostic scenarios. The authors propose a dynamic reward design for rule-based RL that shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. They introduce the Tool-Zero series models, which aim to enable language models to autonomously utilize general tools without post-training. Experimental results show that these models achieve a performance improvement of over 7% compared to supervised fine-tuning and RL-with-supervised fine-tuning models. The gains are consistent across different dataset evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. By leveraging RL and dynamic reward design, the Tool-Zero series models demonstrate the potential for enhancing language models' capabilities in complex tasks. <div>

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our methods.

Summary:
RobustFSM addresses the problem of submodular maximization in a federated setting, where decentralized clients own their data and have different quality definitions. The goal is to find a representative subset of a large dataset while respecting privacy and autonomy. The federated setting is susceptible to client attacks, such as sharing fake information. RobustFSM is a solution designed to be robust against various practical client attacks, outperforming conventional federated algorithms in severe attack scenarios. Empirical evaluation with real-world datasets demonstrates significant improvement in solution quality, up to 200%, depending on the dataset and attack scenarios. Overall, RobustFSM offers a promising approach to enhancing the security and performance of federated submodular maximization in the face of malicious client behavior.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning, but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

Summary:
Neural Operator Warm Starts (NOWS) is a novel approach to speeding up high-fidelity simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs). By utilizing learned solution operators, NOWS enhances classical iterative solvers like conjugate gradient and GMRES by providing high-quality initial guesses. This hybrid strategy significantly reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, cutting computational time by up to 90%. NOWS seamlessly integrates with various numerical methods like finite-difference and finite-element analysis, maintaining stability and convergence guarantees. The combination of neural operators for rapid inference and traditional solvers ensures a reliable and efficient solution for PDE simulations. <div>
arXiv:2511.02481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis, finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new family of circuit classes, $\mathbf{RC}_d$, that take into account physical constraints such as geometric limitations, energetic considerations, and thermodynamic realities. These classes model computation embedded in $d$-dimensional space, where each circuit follows conservative realizability laws. The volume and information flux of these circuits are bounded by specific functions of time and dimension, ensuring that growth occurs through local, physically constructible edits. The study shows that algorithms with certain runtimes cannot scale to inputs of maximal entropy in this framework. Furthermore, it establishes that any $d$-dimensional parallel implementation can offer at most a polynomial speed-up of degree $(d-1)$ over its optimal sequential counterpart. As the dimension approaches infinity, the realizable circuit class $\mathbf{RC}_\infty(\mathrm{polylog})$ converges to the classical class $\mathbf{NC}$, highlighting the idealization of classical parallelism. This extension of circuit complexity into the physical domain reveals universal scaling laws for computation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical circuit complexity characterizes parallel computation in purely combinatorial terms, ignoring the physical constraints that govern real hardware. The standard classes $\mathbf{NC}$, $\mathbf{AC}$, and $\mathbf{TC}$ treat unlimited fan-in, free interconnection, and polynomial gate counts as feasible -- assumptions that conflict with geometric, energetic, and thermodynamic realities. We introduce the family of realizable circuit classes $\mathbf{RC}_d$, which model computation embedded in physical $d$-dimensional space. Each circuit in $\mathbf{RC}_d$ obeys conservative realizability laws: volume scales as $\mathcal{O}(t^d)$, cross-boundary information flux is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(t^{d-1})$ per unit time, and growth occurs through local, physically constructible edits. These bounds apply to all causal systems, classical or quantum. Within this framework, we show that algorithms with runtime $\omega(n^{d/(d-1)})$ cannot scale to inputs of maximal entropy, and that any $d$-dimensional parallel implementation offers at most a polynomial speed-up of degree $(d-1)$ over its optimal sequential counterpart. In the limit $d\to\infty$, $\mathbf{RC}_\infty(\mathrm{polylog})=\mathbf{NC}$, recovering classical parallelism as a non-physical idealization. By unifying geometry, causality, and information flow, $\mathbf{RC}_d$ extends circuit complexity into the physical domain, revealing universal scaling laws for computation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

Summary: 
This paper presents a method to convert a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers designed for binary classification into a deep neural network with one-gate layers and skip connections. By implementing skip connections and reducing the number of gates in each layer, the network structure becomes more efficient and easier to interpret. This transformation allows for a more streamlined architecture while maintaining or improving classification performance. The use of skip connections helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and enables better information flow between layers. Additionally, the introduction of one-gate layers simplifies the network structure and reduces computational complexity. Overall, the proposed approach offers a novel way to enhance the performance and efficiency of neural networks for binary classification tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.

<div> Keywords: Diversified distribution matching, unified translation function, flow matching, ODE-based framework, translation identifiability

Summary: 
Diversified distribution matching (DDM) aims to map conditional source distributions to their target counterparts, addressing content misalignment in unpaired domain translation and achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs, which are unstable and lack transport trajectory information. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. DFM adapts flow matching to enforce a unified translation function, overcoming challenges such as learning the translation function's velocity instead of the function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and structural reformulation provide a tangible implementation. DFM is the first ODE-based approach to ensure translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef) as a test-time scaling method for discrete diffusion models. It leverages reward-guided transitions to refine misaligned states, unlike previous methods that only guide subsequent transitions. IterRef is formalized within a Multiple-Try Metropolis framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. It progressively improves intermediate states by steering them towards the optimal distribution. Evaluation on text and image domains shows consistent enhancements in reward-guided generation quality. The method achieves significant improvements under low compute budgets, surpassing prior baselines. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward- guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

<div> Keywords: Masked Diffusion Models, Lookahead Unmasking, path selection, uncertainty, efficiency

Summary: 
Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) use iteratively unmasking tokens for language models, but their performance is sensitive to the order of unmasking during inference. This study introduces Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which optimizes sampling by selecting paths from all possible unmasking orders without needing an external reward model. The framework consists of a path generator proposing paths and a verifier calculating path uncertainty for selection. LookUM leverages uncertainty to avoid error-prone trajectories and enhance performance across various benchmarks. Notably, LookUM achieves peak performance with only two to three paths, outperforming RL-tuned models and improving both base and post-trained versions of LLaDA. The framework's effectiveness in path selection showcases its efficiency and versatility in improving language modeling tasks. The code for LookUM will be made public. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

<div> variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO, high-risk training samples, personalized robustness budget, two-sided KL-divergence-style bounds, linear inner maximization problem

Summary:<br /><br />The paper introduces a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (Var-DRO) framework to address distribution shifts and minority subpopulations in deep neural network training. This framework automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns personalized robustness budgets based on online loss variance. By constraining the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for each sample, the method optimizes for worst-case risk while avoiding overly conservative models. To stabilize training, a warm-up phase, linear ramp schedule for global budget caps, and label smoothing are introduced. Var-DRO outperforms ERM and KL-DRO on CIFAR-10-C and Waterbirds datasets, demonstrating improved overall performance and competitive results on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. The proposed framework is unsupervised, easy to implement, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient. <div>
arXiv:2511.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of jet fuel demand is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations in the aviation market. Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

arXiv:2511.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-Time Auction (RTA) Interception aims to filter out invalid or irrelevant traffic to enhance the integrity and reliability of downstream data. However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.

<div> Keywords: Neural-guided equation discovery, Residuals, Syntax tree, Equation improvement, Mathematical operations 

Summary: 
Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED) is introduced as a post-processing method to enhance given equations by focusing on their residuals. By utilizing node-based calculation rules on the syntax tree of the initial equation, RED computes residuals for each subequation. These residuals are then used as new target variables in the data set to generate a new prompt for equation suggestion. If the resulting equation from the new prompt outperforms the original on a validation set, it replaces the original subequation. RED is compatible with any equation discovery system, efficient in computation, and easily adaptable for additional mathematical operations. Experimental results on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark demonstrate that RED effectively improves both neural-guided and classical genetic programming equation discovery systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-guided equation discovery systems use a data set as prompt and predict an equation that describes the data set without extensive search. However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations. In experiments on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark, we show that it not only helps to improve all tested neural-guided systems, but also all tested classical genetic programming systems.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces CoPRIS, a reinforcement learning system for enhancing large language models that addresses inefficiencies in fully synchronous RL systems. CoPRIS maintains a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, terminates early to avoid long-tail inefficiencies, and reuses unfinished trajectories. It also introduces Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction to handle off-policy trajectories by incorporating buffered log probabilities from the previous policy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training without compromising performance.

arXiv:2511.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data local. However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quanti- zation to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the- art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth- constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary:
ProjFL and ProjFL+EF are algorithms introduced in this work for federated learning to improve communication efficiency. ProjFL works with unbiased compressors, while ProjFL+EF is tailored for biased compressors with an Error Feedback mechanism. Both algorithms project local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace using historical descent directions to exchange information efficiently with minimal communication overhead. Convergence guarantees are established for strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that both methods achieve comparable accuracy to existing baselines while significantly reducing communication costs. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.

Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance (PdM) plays a pivotal role in improving equipment reliability and reducing operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.

Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2511.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

Summary: 
AutoHood3D presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset consisting of 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods for machine learning applications in engineering component design and process optimization. The dataset focuses on hood deformation due to fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting, modeled using a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It includes time-resolved physical fields, STL meshes, and natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. The dataset addresses limitations of existing datasets by offering 3D cases, diverse geometric variations, and multi-modal annotations. The study validates the numerical methodology, establishes neural architecture baselines, and highlights systematic errors in displacement and force predictions. New approaches and multiphysics loss functions are recommended to improve model training with fluid-solid coupling. AutoHood3D facilitates physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and supports the creation of new fluid-structure interaction benchmarks.

Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Summary:  
FiCABU, a software-hardware co-design, enables efficient machine unlearning at the edge for privacy compliance. It combines Context-Adaptive Unlearning and Balanced Dampening to achieve random-guess forget accuracy while maintaining retain accuracy. The approach starts edits from back-end layers and adjusts dampening strength by depth, reducing computation by up to 87.52% for ResNet-18 and 71.03% for ViT models. Validated on FPGA and synthesized in 45 nm, FiCABU surpasses the retraining-free SSD baseline in retain preservation and energy efficiency on an INT8 hardware prototype. This innovative method demonstrates that depth-aware unlearning can be practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

<div> Adaptive Framework, LSTM Forecasting, Conformal Prediction, Water Distribution Networks, Digital Twins
Summary:
An adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction is proposed for accurate state estimation in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) using Digital Twins. This framework aims to optimize sensor placement by focusing on nodes with the highest uncertainty, rather than using uniform sampling which can be wasteful. The use of Marginal Conformal Prediction allows for low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation. Experimental results on three different network datasets demonstrate a significant reduction in demand error compared to uniform sampling, achieving 33-34% lower error rates at 40% coverage. The adaptive framework also maintains high empirical coverage (89.4-90.2%) with only a small increase in computational cost (5-10%). Overall, the proposed approach shows promising results in improving state estimation accuracy in WDNs while optimizing resource utilization through targeted sensor placement.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33-34% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40% coverage and maintain 89.4-90.2% empirical coverage with only 5-10% extra computation.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

Summary:
The article discusses the increasing integration of machine learning (ML) into hardware for real-time scientific applications and the challenges it faces. Advanced toolchains have reduced design iteration time but have also highlighted new obstacles like hardware synthesis bottlenecks. To address these issues, efforts are being made to develop ML-based surrogate models for estimating resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. The article introduces wa-hls4ml, a benchmark tool for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, along with a dataset of over 680,000 neural networks synthesized using hls4ml on Xilinx FPGAs. It evaluates resource and latency predictors on various ML model architectures and introduces GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models for predicting accelerator performance. The models show promise, accurately predicting latency and resources close to the synthesized values on a test dataset. <div>

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance on standard benchmarks, leading to comparisons with the "BERT moment" for time series analysis. However, their efficacy in real-world industrial applications is uncertain. Research indicates that TSFMs struggle to generalize due to spectral shift, where frequency components in downstream tasks differ from those during pretraining. An investigation in mobile gaming highlighted TSFMs' underperformance compared to domain-adapted models. Controlled synthetic experiments revealed systematic performance degradation under spectral mismatch, emphasizing the importance of frequency awareness in robust TSFM deployment. These findings suggest the need for new pretraining and evaluation approaches that consider spectral diversity explicitly. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

<div> Belief Inertia, Piecewise Stationary Bandits, Regret, Lower Bounds, Non-Stationarity <br />
Summary:
The study examines worst-case regret in piecewise stationary multi-armed bandits. Traditional lower bounds in time-varying settings rely on infrequent sampling, where lack of exploration leads to high regret. The paper introduces a novel approach based on belief inertia, demonstrating how algorithms' historical reward averages create momentum that resists new evidence post-change. This inertia can mislead classical algorithms like Explore Then Commit, epsilon-greedy, and UCB, causing substantial regret growth despite parameter tuning. Even with periodic restarts to handle non-stationarity, worst-case regret remains linear. The findings suggest that leveraging belief inertia is an effective method for deriving precise lower bounds in non-stationary bandit settings. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel analytical framework that simplifies multi-layer ReLU networks into a single-layer linear model with input-dependent effective weights. These effective weights, denoted as $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, adjust based on the activation pattern of ReLU units for each input sample. As training progresses, the effective weights for samples of the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. Tracking the trajectories of these sample-specific effective weights offers insights into the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the development of semantic representations within the network. This approach provides a clearer understanding of the internal workings of deep neural networks and sheds light on the fundamental principles of representation learning in complex, high-dimensional systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural ODE framework, addresses these challenges by incorporating fluid transport principles to model spatiotemporal dynamics. The model derives ODEs for ocean dynamics and integrates external SST drivers, providing insights into SST evolution. SSTODE outperforms existing models in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks, highlighting its interpretability and physical consistency.

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

<div> Keywords: turbulent flows, turbulence models, Eigenspace Perturbation Method, convolutional neural network, calibration

Summary:
Predicting the evolution of turbulent flows is crucial in various fields, but the use of turbulence models introduces uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is commonly used to assess model-form uncertainty, but it may overestimate uncertainty bounds due to its purely physics-based nature. In this study, a hybrid approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with EPM is proposed to enhance the calibration of uncertainty estimates while maintaining physical consistency. By modulating EPM perturbation magnitudes with CNN, the hybrid ML-EPM framework demonstrates significant improvements in providing tighter and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to using EPM alone. This innovative approach holds promise for more accurate predictions in turbulent flow simulations, bridging the gap between physics-based methods and machine learning techniques.

Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.

Summary: 
The article introduces Blind-IGT, a statistical framework for recovering both the rationality parameter and reward parameters in competitive settings where the rationality parameter is unknown. By imposing a normalization constraint to resolve scale ambiguity, the framework can uniquely identify these parameters. An efficient Normalized Least Squares estimator is proposed, achieving optimal convergence rates. In cases where unique identification is not possible, confidence sets are constructed for partial identification. The framework is extended to Markov games, demonstrating optimal convergence rates and strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown. <div>

Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $\tau$) is known a priori. When $\tau$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\tau$ with the reward parameters ($\theta$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\theta$ and $\tau$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.

<div> Keywords: Masked diffusion models, KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling, iteration refinement process, fast sampling method, diverse domains

Summary:
Masked diffusion models have shown promise in various tasks, including language generation. However, their iterative refinement process often leads to slow inference due to static sampling speed. To address this issue, the authors propose KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling (KLASS), a fast sampling method that leverages token-level KL divergence to identify stable predictions with high confidence. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without additional training, KLASS significantly accelerates generation speed while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to 2.78 times faster wall-clock speedups compared to standard greedy decoding, outperforming other diffusion-based samplers. The effectiveness of KLASS is demonstrated across different domains such as text, image, and molecular generation, highlighting its versatility as a widely applicable sampler for diverse models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have demonstrated competitive results on various tasks including language generation. However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.

Summary: 
Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL) addresses the challenge in reinforcement learning of policies failing under distribution shifts in real-world environments. It treats the robustness budget as a continuous curriculum, adapting it based on the agent's progress. This adaptive scheduling allows for a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results show that DR-SPCRL stabilizes training and achieves a superior trade-off between robustness and performance. Compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, DR-SPCRL demonstrates an average 11.8% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations and achieves approximately 1.9 times the performance of corresponding nominal RL algorithms. This method offers a promising solution to the trade-off challenge in reinforcement learning, providing improved robustness and performance in complex environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning is that policies trained in controlled environments often fail under distribution shifts at deployment into real-world environments. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $\epsilon$. However, fixing $\epsilon$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $\epsilon$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.

Summary: 
MSK-MATCH is an AI system developed for automated eligibility screening in cancer clinical trials. It integrates a large language model with an oncology trial knowledge base and retrieval-augmented architecture, providing explanations for all AI predictions based on source text. In a retrospective dataset of 88,518 clinical documents, MSK-MATCH achieved 98.6% accuracy in patient-level eligibility classification, resolving 61.9% of cases automatically and triaging the rest for human review. The AI-assisted workflow outperformed human-only and AI-only comparisons in sensitivity and specificity. For cases requiring manual review, prepopulating eligibility screens with AI-generated explanations reduced screening time significantly and cost only $0.96 per patient-trial pair. This innovative approach could improve participation rates in cancer clinical trials by streamlining eligibility screening processes.

Abstract: Clinical trials play an important role in cancer care and research, yet participation rates remain low. We developed MSK-MATCH (Memorial Sloan Kettering Multi-Agent Trial Coordination Hub), an AI system for automated eligibility screening from clinical text. MSK-MATCH integrates a large language model with a curated oncology trial knowledge base and retrieval-augmented architecture providing explanations for all AI predictions grounded in source text. In a retrospective dataset of 88,518 clinical documents from 731 patients across six breast cancer trials, MSK-MATCH automatically resolved 61.9% of cases and triaged 38.1% for human review. This AI-assisted workflow achieved 98.6% accuracy, 98.4% sensitivity, and 98.7% specificity for patient-level eligibility classification, matching or exceeding performance of the human-only and AI-only comparisons. For the triaged cases requiring manual review, prepopulating eligibility screens with AI-generated explanations reduced screening time from 20 minutes to 43 seconds at an average cost of $0.96 per patient-trial pair.

Summary:
TabDistill introduces a strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge from complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for classifying tabular data. This approach aims to achieve high performance with limited training data while remaining parameter-efficient. The distilled neural networks outperform classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost, and logistic regression with equal training data. In some cases, the distilled models even outperform the original transformer-based models they were derived from. This strategy bridges the gap between performance and complexity, providing a middle ground for effectively handling tabular data classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware ef- fects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide perfor- mance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.

Summary:
- The article introduces GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that combines protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug discovery in gastrointestinal diseases.
- GastroDL-Fusion integrates molecular graph representations of protein-ligand complexes with gene sequence embeddings generated by a pre-trained Transformer model.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

Summary:
In this study, the utility of traditional chemical functional groups in chemical explanations was formally assessed using an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length principle. The algorithm searched for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules, discovering both human-curated functional groups and novel larger patterns with specific functions. The algorithm was then applied to 24 bioactivity prediction datasets to find dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from these dataset-specific functional groups outperformed other fingerprint representations in bioactivity regression tasks. This research showcases the effectiveness of using unsupervised learning algorithms and the Minimum Message Length principle in identifying functional groups and improving bioactivity prediction models. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.

The study presents an active learning algorithm called PartiBandits for efficient estimation of the mean of a k-class random variable with limited labels and access to informative covariates. The algorithm provides an estimate of the mean with an error that decreases with the number of labels N. It consists of two stages - learning a partition of unlabeled data to reduce conditional variance and using a UCB-style subroutine for label requests. The convergence rates of both the algorithm and subroutine are optimal. PartiBandits combines UCB and disagreement-based approaches in active learning, demonstrating versatility. Simulation using electronic health records showcases the algorithm's effectiveness. The PartiBandits package in R enables easy implementation of the proposed method. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm ("PartiBandits") to estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\widehat{\mu}_{\text{PB}}$, such that $\left( \widehat{\mu}_{\text{PB}} - \mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{\nu + \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $\nu$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine ("WarmStart-UCB") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R.

<div> Keywords: Sparse autoencoders, large language models, interpretability, Mixture of Experts, feature redundancy

Summary: 
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are important for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by breaking down token activations into understandable features. However, the high dimensionality of SAEs for better interpretability leads to costly training and inference. Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques aim to address this by splitting SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation to reduce computation. Nonetheless, MoE-SAE faces a limitation where experts often do not specialize and learn overlapping features. To tackle this issue, the authors introduce Multiple Expert Activation to engage semantically weighted expert subsets simultaneously and Feature Scaling for diverse feature learning via adaptive scaling. Experimental results show improved performance with a 24% lower reconstruction error and 99% less feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the gap between interpretability and efficiency in LLM analysis by enabling transparent model investigation while maintaining computational feasibility.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

Summary: 
In the study of Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs), the lack of strong duality and non-contractive properties of the Robust Bellman operator pose challenges for traditional methods. To tackle these obstacles, an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs is proposed in this work. The algorithm is shown to achieve both feasibility and optimality within certain bounds, with sample complexities comparable to the discounted setting. The method addresses the difficulties of finding robust and safe policies in a complex environment, showcasing promising results in overcoming the limitations of standard primal-dual approaches. This research provides a valuable contribution to the field of constrained reinforcement learning, offering a new perspective on tackling challenging problems in Markov decision processes. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding robust and safe policies in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs). A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL. Additional difficulties arise from the average-cost setting, where the Robust Bellman operator is not a contraction under any norm. To address these challenges, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs. We show that our method achieves both \(\epsilon\)-feasibility and \(\epsilon\)-optimality, and we establish a sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(\epsilon^{-4}\right)\) and \(\tilde{O}\left(\epsilon^{-6}\right)\) with and without slackness assumption, which is comparable to the discounted setting.

Summary: 
An innovative error-bounded lossy compression framework tailored for Federated Learning (FL) gradient data is proposed to address communication efficiency in collaborative model training. The framework leverages temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels for high compression ratios. It includes a magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average and a sign predictor leveraging gradient oscillation and kernel-level consistency. Experimental results show up to 1.53x higher compression ratios compared to existing methods with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, the new framework reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating scalability for practical FL deployments. <div>
arXiv:2511.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.

Summary:
The paper introduces MARAuder's Map, a framework for real-time human activity recognition in smart homes using raw sensor data. The method projects sensor activations onto a physical floorplan to create trajectory-aware image sequences, capturing the spatial flow of human movement. A hybrid deep learning model is employed to process these representations, incorporating spatial structure and temporal dependencies. A learnable time embedding module encodes contextual cues like hour-of-day and day-of-week to enhance temporal awareness. An attention-based encoder focuses on informative segments within observation windows, enabling accurate recognition even during cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on real-world smart home datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time human activity recognition in ambient sensor environments.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

<div> Keywords: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Traffic Signal Control, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Interpretable Policies, Symbolic Priority Functions

Summary:
SymLight introduces a framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to discover interpretable symbolic priority functions for traffic signal control policies. These priority functions take traffic features as input and output priorities for each traffic signal phase, allowing for effective phase transition. The framework includes a concise representation for the priority function to handle the complexity of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy uses patterns from high-quality priority functions to guide the search process. Experimental results show SymLight outperforms baselines on real-world datasets, producing interpretable policies that can be deployed effectively while maintaining high performance. Overall, SymLight offers a promising approach for generating efficient and understandable traffic signal control policies using deep reinforcement learning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

<div> bandit algorithms, multi-objective decision-making, lexicographic preferences, regret minimization, best arm identification

Summary: In the context of multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, this study introduces two elimination-based algorithms that balance regret minimization and best arm identification under lexicographic preferences. The first algorithm sequentially eliminates suboptimal arms based on priority objectives, achieving competitive sample complexity and regret bounds. The second algorithm leverages cross-objective dependencies to outperform the lower bound for single-objective bandit problems. Empirical results confirm the superior performance of these algorithms over baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. <div>
arXiv:2511.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

<div> detect, agentic language models, attention, spectral statistics, context verification  
Summary:  
The article introduces a diagnostic method for agentic language models that can detect errors in reasoning chains caused by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention in early layers and computes spectral statistics, specifically the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. Using a two-regime mixture assumption, the method shows that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal for detecting context inconsistency. Empirical results demonstrate the method's robustness in context verification across different model families, with low processing overhead. The approach can be integrated into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and used as an inline safety monitor to detect contamination in the text while the model is still processing it, preventing errors from propagating in the reasoning chain.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.

Summary:
- AI models are often evaluated based on their predictive ability, but interventions in social impact applications can bias evaluations.
- RCTs randomize interventions, but traditional approaches ignore data from the treatment group, leading to inefficiencies.
- The study quantifies bias from aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups and proposes nuisance parameter weighting (NPW) for unbiased model evaluation.
- NPW reweights treatment group data to mimic distributions under no intervention, improving model selection compared to standard approaches.
- Synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NPW in various intervention effect and sample size scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\"ively aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

<div> Keywords: FP8 training, numerical stability, two-level microscaling, automatic scaling, training efficiency

Summary: 
MOSS is a new FP8 training framework designed to address challenges in efficiency and numerical stability. It introduces a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, combining global and local scales to balance precision and dequantization cost effectively. Additionally, MOSS implements automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, eliminating costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. These innovations allow for efficient FP8 training of large language models, achieving performance comparable to BF16 baseline models while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.MOSS improves efficiency and stability in FP8 training by optimizing quantization strategies for activations and weights, leading to significant performance gains in training large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Summary:
This study delves into the challenges of deploying Mixture of Experts (MoE) models due to their high memory requirements. The authors analyze expert activation and caching behavior, proposing a Least Frequently Used (LFU) caching optimization that outperforms the traditional Least Recently Used (LRU) approach. Furthermore, they explore the implementation and potential benefits of speculative expert pre-fetching. The study provides insights into the behavior of the MoE architecture, shedding light on the characteristics of the gating network and experts. These findings not only enhance our understanding of MoE models but also lay the groundwork for future research on interpreting MoE models and developing pruning techniques with minimal performance impact.

arXiv:2511.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

<div> distance metric, categorical data clustering, cluster-customized, mixed data, experiments

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach for clustering categorical data by proposing a cluster-customized distance metric. Traditional distance metrics do not consider the varying distances between attribute values in different clusters, leading to inaccurate measurements. The proposed method updates distances based on the distributions of attributes within each cluster, resulting in more precise clustering. Additionally, the distance metric is extended to handle mixed data with numerical and categorical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, consistently achieving top rankings across multiple datasets. The source code for the method is also made available for further research and implementation. <div>

Abstract: An appropriate distance metric is crucial for categorical data clustering, as the distance between categorical data cannot be directly calculated. However, the distances between attribute values usually vary in different clusters induced by their different distributions, which has not been taken into account, thus leading to unreasonable distance measurement. Therefore, we propose a cluster-customized distance metric for categorical data clustering, which can competitively update distances based on different distributions of attributes in each cluster. In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, i.e., achieving an average ranking of around first in fourteen datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%. Codes can be found in https://github.com/ddz16/PFRP.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

<title>FusionLog: Cross-System Log-based Anomaly Detection via Fusion of General and Proprietary Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85{\deg}C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Abstract: We introduce a unified attention-based framework for joint score and density estimation. Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\nabla_x \log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.

Abstract: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification.

<title>Next-Latent Prediction Transformers Learn Compact World Models</title>

Abstract: Transformers replace recurrence with a memory that grows with sequence length and self-attention that enables ad-hoc look ups over past tokens. Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning. NextLat stands as a simple and efficient paradigm for shaping transformer representations toward stronger generalization.

<title>Explainable Deep Learning-based Classification of Wolff-Parkinson-White Electrocardiographic Signals</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05973</link>

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

<title>Are Time-Indexed Foundation Models the Future of Time Series Imputation?</title>

Abstract: Foundation models for time series imputation remain largely unexplored. Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.

Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

<title>Lethe: Layer- and Time-Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Reasoning-Intensive LLM Serving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

<title>ITPP: Learning Disentangled Event Dynamics in Marked Temporal Point Processes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Abstract: We propose a consistency model based on the optimal-transport flow. A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation. During the training stage, we couple the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) residual in the OT formulation with the original flow matching loss function. Our approach avoids inner optimization subproblems that are present in previous one-step OFM approaches. During the prediction stage, our approach supports both one-step (Brenier-map) and multi-step ODE sampling from the same learned potential, leveraging the straightness of the OT flow. We validate scalability and performance on standard OT benchmarks.

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is evolving through algorithms capable of identifying outliers in complex datasets. The Isolation Forest (IF), a pivotal AD technique, exhibits adaptability limitations and biases. This paper introduces the Function-based Isolation Forest (FuBIF), a generalization of IF that enables the use of real-valued functions for dataset branching, significantly enhancing the flexibility of evaluation tree construction. Complementing this, the FuBIF Feature Importance (FuBIFFI) algorithm extends the interpretability in IF-based approaches by providing feature importance scores across possible FuBIF models. This paper details the operational framework of FuBIF, evaluates its performance against established methods, and explores its theoretical contributions. An open-source implementation is provided to encourage further research and ensure reproducibility.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.
  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.

arXiv:2511.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-video recommenders such as Douyin must exploit extremely long user histories without breaking latency or cost budgets. We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of engineering systems under uncertainty poses significant computational challenges, particularly for problems involving high-dimensional stochastic inputs, nonlinear system responses, and multiphysics couplings. Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making environments, yet its lack of transparency limits its deployment in practice, especially in safety-critical settings. Shapley values from cooperative game theory provide a principled framework for explaining reinforcement learning; however, the computational cost of Shapley explanations is an obstacle to their use. We introduce FastSVERL, a scalable method for explaining reinforcement learning by approximating Shapley values. FastSVERL is designed to handle the unique challenges of reinforcement learning, including temporal dependencies across multi-step trajectories, learning from off-policy data, and adapting to evolving agent behaviours in real time. FastSVERL introduces a practical, scalable approach for principled and rigorous interpretability in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

Abstract: We study the sequential decision-making problem for automated weaning of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in cardiogenic shock patients. MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.

Abstract: As learning models continue to grow in size, enabling on-device local training of these models has emerged as a critical challenge in federated learning. A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better pre- dictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between en- tities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for un- derstanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various ap- plications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversar- ial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computa- tionally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally ef- ficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.

<title>LLM Attention Transplant for Transfer Learning of Tabular Data Across Disparate Domains</title>

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of a directed Gaussian Graphical Model under the equal-variance assumption, where the graph has $n$ nodes and maximum in-degree $d$. Prior work has established that $O(d \log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.

<title>Local K-Similarity Constraint for Federated Learning with Label Noise</title>

Abstract: Federated learning on clients with noisy labels is a challenging problem, as such clients can infiltrate the global model, impacting the overall generalizability of the system. Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

<title>Sparse Linear Regression is Easy on Random Supports</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06211</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse linear regression is one of the most basic questions in machine learning and statistics. Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + {\xi}$, and ${\xi}$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\widehat{{w}}$ that has small prediction error: $\frac{1}{N}\cdot \|{X} {w}^* - {X} \widehat{{w}}\|^2_2$.
  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $\epsilon$ with roughly $N = O(k \log d/\epsilon)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{\Omega(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.
  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $\epsilon$ with $N = \text{poly}(k, \log d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples and run-time $\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\text{poly}(d)}$.
  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\text{poly}(\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) learns node and graph representations by contrasting multiple views of the same graph. Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $\alpha \in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $\alpha$ yields localized features, while large $\alpha$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $\alpha$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation in Microscopic Traffic Simulations Considering Credit Assignment</title>

Abstract: This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.

Abstract: Human-computer interaction increasingly demands systems that recognize not only explicit user inputs but also implicit emotional states. While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $\eta_{\text{eff}} = \Theta(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization proxies, machine learning (ML) models trained to efficiently predict optimal solutions for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. While promising, optimization proxy performance heavily depends on training data quality. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel active sampling framework for ACOPF optimization proxies designed to generate realistic and diverse training data. The framework actively explores varied, flexible problem specifications reflecting plausible operational realities. More importantly, the approach uses optimization-specific quantities (active constraint sets) that better capture the salient features of an ACOPF that lead to the optimal solution. Numerical results show superior generalization over existing sampling methods with an equivalent training budget, significantly advancing the state-of-practice for trustworthy ACOPF optimization proxies.

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is of great significance for drug discovery and drug repurposing. With the accumulation of a large volume of valuable data, data-driven methods have been increasingly harnessed to predict DTIs, reducing costs across various dimensions. Therefore, this paper proposes a $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel and $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{M}$odel data co-powered $\textbf{D}$rug $\textbf{T}$arget $\textbf{I}$nteraction prediction framework, named LLM$^3$-DTI. LLM$^3$-DTI constructs multi-modal data embedding to enhance DTI prediction performance. In this framework, the text semantic embeddings of drugs and targets are encoded by a domain-specific LLM. To effectively align and fuse multi-modal embedding. We propose the dual cross-attention mechanism and the TSFusion module. Finally, these multi-modal data are utilized for the DTI task through an output network. The experimental results indicate that LLM$^3$-DTI can proficiently identify validated DTIs, surpassing the performance of the models employed for comparison across diverse scenarios. Consequently, LLM$^3$-DTI is adept at fulfilling the task of DTI prediction with excellence. The data and code are available at https://github.com/chaser-gua/LLM3DTI.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

<title>Transolver is a Linear Transformer: Revisiting Physics-Attention through the Lens of Linear Attention</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Abstract: Urban environments are continuously mapped and modeled by various data collection platforms, including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and street cameras. The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.

Abstract: Since 2010, Kaggle has been a platform where data scientists from around the world come together to compete, collaborate, and push the boundaries of Data Science. Over these 15 years, it has grown from a purely competition-focused site into a broader ecosystem with forums, notebooks, models, datasets, and more. With the release of the Kaggle Meta Code and Kaggle Meta Datasets, we now have a unique opportunity to explore these competitions, technologies, and real-world applications of Machine Learning and AI. And so in this study, we take a closer look at 15 years of data science on Kaggle - through metadata, shared code, community discussions, and the competitions themselves. We explore Kaggle's growth, its impact on the data science community, uncover hidden technological trends, analyze competition winners, how Kagglers approach problems in general, and more. We do this by analyzing millions of kernels and discussion threads to perform both longitudinal trend analysis and standard exploratory data analysis. Our findings show that Kaggle is a steadily growing platform with increasingly diverse use cases, and that Kagglers are quick to adapt to new trends and apply them to real-world challenges, while producing - on average - models with solid generalization capabilities. We also offer a snapshot of the platform as a whole, highlighting its history and technological evolution. Finally, this study is accompanied by a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVOV9bIUNrM) and a Kaggle write-up (https://kaggle.com/competitions/meta-kaggle-hackathon/writeups/kaggle-chronicles-15-years-of-competitions-communi) for your convenience.

<title>DRIVE: Data Curation Best Practices for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward in Competitive Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent reasoning-first models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have spurred a resurgence of interest in RLVR. Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

<title>Scalable Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions Using Linear Bound Propagation</title>

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization</title>

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\epsilon$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

<title>Adaptive Regularization for Large-Scale Sparse Feature Embedding Models</title>

Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, they have not clearly identified the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains why overfitting occurs in models that use large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive regularization method to address it. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.

<title>Vocabulary In-Context Learning in Transformers: Benefits of Positional Encoding</title>

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture possesses the capability for in-context learning (ICL). In scenarios involving function approximation, context can serve as a control parameter for the model, endowing it with the universal approximation property (UAP). In practice, context is represented by tokens from a finite set, referred to as a vocabulary, which is the case considered in this paper, \emph{i.e.}, vocabulary in-context learning (VICL). We demonstrate that VICL in single-layer Transformers, without positional encoding, does not possess the UAP; however, it is possible to achieve the UAP when positional encoding is included. Several sufficient conditions for the positional encoding are provided. Our findings reveal the benefits of positional encoding from an approximation theory perspective in the context of ICL.

<title>CG-TTRL: Context-Guided Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for On-Device Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

<title>How Wide and How Deep? Mitigating Over-Squashing of GNNs via Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: Data valuation quantifies data importance, but existing methods cannot ensure validity in a single training process. The neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method [3] addresses this limitation. Based on NDDV, we are the first to explore error estimation and convergence analysis in data valuation. Under Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions, we derive quadratic error bounds for loss differences that scale inversely with time steps and quadratically with control variations, ensuring stability. We also prove that the expected squared gradient norm for the training loss vanishes asymptotically, and that the meta loss converges sublinearly over iterations. In particular, NDDV achieves sublinear convergence.

arXiv:2511.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, optimizers that explicitly treat weights as matrices, rather than flattened vectors, have demonstrated their effectiveness. This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid detection and treatment to prevent progression to severe sepsis, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Despite advances in medical technology, it remains a major challenge for clinicians. While recent machine learning models have shown promise in predicting sepsis onset, their black-box nature limits interpretability and clinical trust. In this study, we present an interpretable AI approach for sepsis analysis that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge. Our method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established medical expertise.

Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

Abstract: We propose and investigate probabilistic guarantees for the adversarial robustness of classification algorithms. While traditional formal verification approaches for robustness are intractable and sampling-based approaches do not provide formal guarantees, our approach is able to efficiently certify a probabilistic relaxation of robustness. The key idea is to sample an $\epsilon$-net and invoke a local robustness oracle on the sample. Remarkably, the size of the sample needed to achieve probably approximately global robustness guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the learning algorithm itself. Our approach can, therefore, be applied even to large neural networks that are beyond the scope of traditional formal verification. Experiments empirically confirm that it characterizes robustness better than state-of-the-art sampling-based approaches and scales better than formal methods.

<title>Efficient Approximation of Volterra Series for High-Dimensional Systems</title>

Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.

<title>TriShGAN: Enhancing Sparsity and Robustness in Multivariate Time Series Counterfactuals Explanation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06529</link>

arXiv:2511.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

<title>Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification with Anchored Ensembles for Robust EV Power Consumption Prediction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.

<title>Practical Policy Distillation for Reinforcement Learning in Radio Access Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in radio access networks (RANs) presents several challenges, including limited availability of link-level measurements (e.g., CQI reports), stringent real-time processing constraints (e.g., sub-1 ms per TTI), and network heterogeneity (different spectrum bands, cell types, and vendor equipment). A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\mu s inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

<title>Breaking the Dyadic Barrier: Rethinking Fairness in Link Prediction Beyond Demographic Parity</title>

arXiv:2511.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

<title>Optimistic Online-to-Batch Conversions for Accelerated Convergence and Universality</title>

arXiv:2511.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study offline convex optimization with smooth objectives, where the classical Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method achieves the optimal accelerated convergence. Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.

Abstract: Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.

Abstract: Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

<title>Beyond Fixed Depth: Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Node Classification Under Varying Homophily</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

<title>A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.

<title>Non-Rival Data as Rival Products: An Encapsulation-Forging Approach for Data Synthesis</title>

Abstract: The non-rival nature of data creates a dilemma for firms: sharing data unlocks value but risks eroding competitive advantage. Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse. EnFo offers a practical solution for firms to collaborate strategically without compromising their core analytical advantage.

Abstract: Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/rickzky1001/CaberNet-CRL.

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification, where the objective is to minimize the error w.r.t. a distribution $\mu_1$, subject to the constraint that the error w.r.t. a distribution $\mu_0$ remains below a prescribed threshold. While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $\mu_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer. In addition to such statistical guarantees, the procedures is efficient, as shown via complementary computational guarantees.

Abstract: In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, deciding where to place physical assets, such as commercial beverage coolers, can directly impact revenue growth and execution efficiency. Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations

<title>Dual-Pathway Fusion of EHRs and Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Unseen Drug-Drug Interactions</title>

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.

However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

<title>Peeling Context from Cause for Multimodal Molecular Property Prediction</title>

Abstract: Deep models are used for molecular property prediction, yet they are often difficult to interpret and may rely on spurious context rather than causal structure, which reduces reliability under distribution shift and harms predictive performance. We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits. Case studies confirm the accuracy of these maps and their alignment with chemical intuition. By peeling context from cause at every layer, the model yields predictors that are both accurate and interpretable for molecular design.

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

<title>Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

Abstract: Efficient on-device language models around 1 billion parameters are essential for powering low-latency AI applications on mobile and wearable devices. However, achieving strong performance in this model class, while supporting long context windows and practical deployment remains a significant challenge. We introduce MobileLLM-Pro, a 1-billion-parameter language model optimized for on-device deployment. MobileLLM-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results across 11 standard benchmarks, significantly outperforming both Gemma 3-1B and Llama 3.2-1B, while supporting context windows of up to 128,000 tokens and showing only minor performance regressions at 4-bit quantization. These improvements are enabled by four core innovations: (1) implicit positional distillation, a novel technique that effectively instills long-context capabilities through knowledge distillation; (2) a specialist model merging framework that fuses multiple domain experts into a compact model without parameter growth; (3) simulation-driven data mixing using utility estimation; and (4) 4-bit quantization-aware training with self-distillation. We release our model weights and code to support future research in efficient on-device language models.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for adapting models to new tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uni-modal data, multi-modal learning offers substantial benefits by utilizing diverse sensory inputs, akin to human perception. However, multi-modal continual learning presents additional challenges, as the model must effectively integrate new information from various modalities while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning. Our framework includes a novel cross-modality adapter with a mixture-of-experts structure to facilitate effective integration of multi-modal information across tasks. We also introduce a representation alignment loss that fosters learning of robust multi-modal representations, and regularize relationships between learned representations to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Experiments on several multi-modal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

<title>Dual Mamba for Node-Specific Representation Learning: Tackling Over-Smoothing with Selective State Space Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06756</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

<title>Data Trajectory Alignment for LLM Domain Adaptation: A Two-Phase Synthesis Framework for Telecommunications Mathematics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06776</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $\beta$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

<title>Rethinking Parameter Sharing as Graph Coloring for Structured Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $\alpha:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

arXiv:2511.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning to sustainable and resilient energy systems requires navigating complex and interdependent trade-offs across environmental, social, and resource dimensions. Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints. This modeling framework can further support more adaptive and resilient energy transition planning on spatial and institutional scales.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

Abstract: As the right to be forgotten becomes legislated worldwide, machine unlearning mechanisms have emerged to efficiently update models for data deletion and enhance user privacy protection. However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

Abstract: We propose FedNET, a proactive and privacy-preserving framework for early identification of high-risk links in large-scale communication networks, that leverages a distributed multi-step traffic forecasting method. FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.

<title>Recursive Dynamics in Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Networks: Toward Reflective Intelligence</title>

arXiv:2511.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\gamma$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\gamma$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\gamma \approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

Abstract: We propose a Newton-based scheme, initialized by neural operator predictions, to accelerate the parametric solution of nonlinear problems in computational solid mechanics. First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach reduces computational cost while preserving accuracy, highlighting its potential to accelerate large-scale nonlinear simulations.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency. However, due to the accumulation of model errors over long-horizon rollouts, such methods often face challenges in maintaining modeling stability. To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

Abstract: Monte Carlo random walk methods are widely used in capacitance extraction for their mesh-free formulation and inherent parallelism. However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

Abstract: Determining the minimum width of fully connected neural networks has become a fundamental problem in recent theoretical studies of deep neural networks. In this paper, we study the lower bounds and upper bounds of the minimum width required for fully connected neural networks in order to have universal approximation capability, which is important in network design and training. We show that $w_{min}\leq\max(2d_x+1, d_y)$ for networks with ELU, SELU, and the upper bound of this inequality is attained when $d_y=2d_x$, where $d_x$, $d_y$ denote the input and output dimensions, respectively. Besides, we show that $d_x+1\leq w_{min}\leq d_x+d_y$ for networks with LeakyReLU, ELU, CELU, SELU, Softplus, by proving that ReLU can be approximated by these activation functions. In addition, in the case that the activation function is injective or can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of injective functions (e.g., ReLU), we present a new proof of the inequality $w_{min}\ge d_y+\mathbf{1}_{d_x<d_y\leq2d_x}$ by constructing a more intuitive example via a new geometric approach based on Poincar$\acute{\text{e}}$-Miranda Theorem.

<title>MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC): An Hybrid-Information-Guided-Block Pruning with Progressive Inner Slicing Approach to Model Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06842</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06842</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC), a two-scale, shape-safe compression framework that interleaves information-guided block pruning with progressive inner slicing and staged knowledge distillation (KD). First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage "planes" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules. The result is a compact, practical recipe for deployment-ready models that match or surpass teacher accuracy at a fraction of the compute.

<title>Beyond Observations: Reconstruction Error-Guided Irregularly Sampled Time Series Representation Learning</title>

arXiv:2511.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\"odinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.

<title>TuckA: Hierarchical Compact Tensor Experts for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Efficiently fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a key challenge in the era of foundation models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) presents a promising solution, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning by updating only a small number of adaptation weights per layer. Traditional PEFT methods typically rely on a single expert, where the adaptation weight is a low-rank matrix. However, for complex tasks, the data's inherent diversity poses a significant challenge for such models, as a single adaptation weight cannot adequately capture the features of all samples. To address this limitation, we explore how to integrate multiple small adaptation experts into a compact structure to defeat a large adapter. Specifically, we propose Tucker Adaptation (TuckA), a method with four key properties: (i) We use Tucker decomposition to create a compact 3D tensor where each slice naturally serves as an expert. The low-rank nature of this decomposition ensures that the number of parameters scales efficiently as more experts are added. (ii) We introduce a hierarchical strategy that organizes these experts into groups at different granularities, allowing the model to capture both local and global data patterns. (iii) We develop an efficient batch-level routing mechanism, which reduces the router's parameter size by a factor of $L$ compared to routing at every adapted layer (where $L$ is the number of adapted layers) (iv) We propose data-aware initialization to achieve loss-free expert load balancing based on theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in natural language understanding, image classification, and mathematical reasoning speak to the efficacy of TuckA, offering a new and effective solution to the PEFT problem.

arXiv:2511.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Series (TS) exhibits pronounced non-stationarity. Consequently, most forecasting methods display compromised robustness to concept drift, despite the prevalent application of instance normalization. We tackle this challenge by first analysing concept drift through a bias-variance lens and proving that weighted ensemble reduces variance without increasing bias. These insights motivate DeepBooTS, a novel end-to-end dual-stream residual-decreasing boosting method that progressively reconstructs the intrinsic signal. In our design, each block of a deep model becomes an ensemble of learners with an auxiliary output branch forming a highway to the final prediction. The block-wise outputs correct the residuals of previous blocks, leading to a learning-driven decomposition of both inputs and targets. This method enhances versatility and interpretability while substantially improving robustness to concept drift. Extensive experiments, including those on large-scale datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by a large margin, yielding an average performance improvement of 15.8% across various datasets, establishing a new benchmark for TS forecasting.

<title>COGNOS: Universal Enhancement for Time Series Anomaly Detection via Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods are a dominant paradigm in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), however, their near-universal reliance on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss results in statistically flawed reconstruction residuals. This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: a Kalman Smoothing Post-processor that provably operates as a statistically optimal estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. The synergy between these two components allows COGNOS to robustly separate the true anomaly signal from random fluctuations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGNOS is highly effective, delivering an average F-score uplift of 57.9% when applied to 12 diverse backbone models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our work reveals that directly regularizing output statistics is a powerful and generalizable strategy for significantly improving anomaly detection systems.

arXiv:2511.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting (DAEPF) is critical for the efficient operation of power systems, but extreme condition and market anomalies pose significant challenges to existing forecasting methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Distilled Attention Transformer (DAT) model and an Autoencoder Self-regression Model (ASM). The DAT leverages a self-attention mechanism to dynamically assign higher weights to critical segments of historical data, effectively capturing both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Concurrently, the ASM employs unsupervised learning to detect and isolate anomalous patterns induced by extreme conditions, such as heavy rain, heat waves, or human festivals. Experiments on datasets sampled from California and Shandong Province demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our framework thus holds promise for enhancing grid resilience and optimizing market operations in future power systems.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become popular due to excellent energy efficiency, yet facing challenges for effective model training. Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available~\footnote{https://github.com/SinoLeu/CKDSNN.git}.

Abstract: Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.

Abstract: In the training of large deep neural networks, there is a need for vast amounts of training data. To meet this need, data is collected from multiple domains, such as Wikipedia and GitHub. These domains are heterogeneous in both data quality and the diversity of information they provide. This raises the question of how much we should rely on each domain. Several methods have attempted to address this issue by assigning sampling weights to each data domain using heuristics or approximations. As a first step toward a deeper understanding of the role of data mixing, this work revisits the problem by studying two kinds of weights: sampling weights, which control how much each domain contributes in a batch, and loss weights, which scale the loss from each domain during training. Through a rigorous study of linear regression, we show that these two weights play complementary roles. First, they can reduce the variance of gradient estimates in iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Second, they can improve generalization performance by reducing the generalization gap. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for these claims. We further study the joint dynamics of sampling weights and loss weights, examining how they can be combined to capture both contributions.

Abstract: Transformers have shown strong ability to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly adopted as world models in model-based reinforcement learning (RL) under partial observability. However, unlike natural language corpora, RL trajectories are sparse and reward-driven, making standard self-attention inefficient because it distributes weight uniformly across all past tokens rather than emphasizing the few transitions critical for control. To address this, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention mechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that constrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors that learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We integrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a Transformer-based world model that supports planning under partial observability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most efficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates attention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate useful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian Attention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores over UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains with non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are difficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly adapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into self-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for dynamics modeling under partial observability.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often under-perform on tabular data due to their sensitivity to irrelevant features and a spectral bias toward smooth, low-frequency functions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture the sharp, high-frequency signals that often define tabular structure, especially under limited labeled samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers promise in such settings, it remains challenging in tabular domains due to the lack of effective data augmentations. We propose a hybrid autoencoder that combines a neural encoder with an oblivious soft decision tree (OSDT) encoder, each guided by its own stochastic gating network that performs sample-specific feature selection. Together, these structurally different encoders and model-specific gating networks implement model-based augmentation, producing complementary input views tailored to each architecture. The two encoders, trained with a shared decoder and cross-reconstruction loss, learn distinct yet aligned representations that reflect their respective inductive biases. During training, the OSDT encoder (robust to noise and effective at modeling localized, high-frequency structure) guides the neural encoder toward representations more aligned with tabular data. At inference, only the neural encoder is used, preserving flexibility and SSL compatibility. Spectral analysis highlights the distinct inductive biases of each encoder. Our method achieves consistent gains in low-label classification and regression across diverse tabular datasets, outperforming deep and tree-based supervised baselines.

To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.

Abstract: Efficiently and accurately determining the symmetry is a crucial step in the structural analysis of crystalline materials. Existing methods usually mindlessly apply deep learning models while ignoring the underlying chemical rules. More importantly, experiments show that they face a serious sub-property confusion SPC problem. To address the above challenges, from a decoupled perspective, we introduce the XRDecoupler framework, a problem-solving arsenal specifically designed to tackle the SPC problem. Imitating the thinking process of chemists, we innovatively incorporate multidimensional crystal symmetry information as superclass guidance to ensure that the model's prediction process aligns with chemical intuition. We further design a hierarchical PXRD pattern learning model and a multi-objective optimization approach to achieve high-quality representation and balanced optimization. Comprehensive evaluations on three mainstream databases (e.g., CCDC, CoREMOF, and InorganicData) demonstrate that XRDecoupler excels in performance, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Bayesian inference, while foundational to probabilistic reasoning, is often hampered by the computational intractability of posterior distributions, particularly through the challenging evidence integral. Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems.

<title>Breaking the Gradient Barrier: Unveiling Large Language Models for Strategic Classification</title>

Abstract: Strategic classification~(SC) explores how individuals or entities modify their features strategically to achieve favorable classification outcomes. However, existing SC methods, which are largely based on linear models or shallow neural networks, face significant limitations in terms of scalability and capacity when applied to real-world datasets with significantly increasing scale, especially in financial services and the internet sector. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage large language models to design a more scalable and efficient SC framework, especially in the case of growing individuals engaged with decision-making processes. Specifically, we introduce GLIM, a gradient-free SC method grounded in in-context learning. During the feed-forward process of self-attention, GLIM implicitly simulates the typical bi-level optimization process of SC, including both the feature manipulation and decision rule optimization. Without fine-tuning the LLMs, our proposed GLIM enjoys the advantage of cost-effective adaptation in dynamic strategic environments. Theoretically, we prove GLIM can support pre-trained LLMs to adapt to a broad range of strategic manipulations. We validate our approach through experiments with a collection of pre-trained LLMs on real-world and synthetic datasets in financial and internet domains, demonstrating that our GLIM exhibits both robustness and efficiency, and offering an effective solution for large-scale SC tasks.

Abstract: Anxiety disorders impact millions globally, yet traditional diagnosis relies on clinical interviews, while machine learning models struggle with overfitting due to limited data. Large-scale data collection remains costly and time-consuming, restricting accessibility. To address this, we introduce the Hyperbolic Curvature Few-Shot Learning Network (HCFSLN), a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) framework for multimodal anxiety detection, integrating speech, physiological signals, and video data. HCFSLN enhances feature separability through hyperbolic embeddings, cross-modal attention, and an adaptive gating network, enabling robust classification with minimal data. We collected a multimodal anxiety dataset from 108 participants and benchmarked HCFSLN against six FSL baselines, achieving 88% accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by 14%. These results highlight the effectiveness of hyperbolic space for modeling anxiety-related speech patterns and demonstrate FSL's potential for anxiety classification.

Abstract: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across a range of reasoning and understanding tasks. Prior work often utilizes model ensembles or multi-agent systems to collaboratively generate responses, effectively operating in a server-to-server paradigm. However, such approaches do not align well with practical deployment settings, where a limited number of server-side models are shared by many clients under modern internet architectures. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoLM} (\textbf{Co}llaboration in \textbf{L}arge-\textbf{M}odels), a novel framework for collaborative reasoning that redefines cooperation among large models from a client-server perspective. Unlike traditional ensemble methods that rely on simultaneous inference from multiple models to produce a single output, CoLM allows the outputs of multiple models to be aggregated or shared, enabling each client model to independently refine and update its own generation based on these high-quality outputs. This design enables collaborative benefits by fully leveraging both client-side and shared server-side models. We further extend CoLM to vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating its applicability beyond language tasks. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that CoLM consistently improves model performance on previously failed queries, highlighting the effectiveness of collaborative guidance in enhancing single-model capabilities.

<title>S$^2$Drug: Bridging Protein Sequence and 3D Structure in Contrastive Representation Learning for Virtual Screening</title>

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is an essential task in drug discovery, focusing on the identification of small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. Existing deep learning methods, from early regression models to recent contrastive learning approaches, primarily rely on structural data while overlooking protein sequences, which are more accessible and can enhance generalizability. However, directly integrating protein sequences poses challenges due to the redundancy and noise in large-scale protein-ligand datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{S$^2$Drug}, a two-stage framework that explicitly incorporates protein \textbf{S}equence information and 3D \textbf{S}tructure context in protein-ligand contrastive representation learning. In the first stage, we perform protein sequence pretraining on ChemBL using an ESM2-based backbone, combined with a tailored data sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and noise on both protein and ligand sides. In the second stage, we fine-tune on PDBBind by fusing sequence and structure information through a residue-level gating module, while introducing an auxiliary binding site prediction task. This auxiliary task guides the model to accurately localize binding residues within the protein sequence and capture their 3D spatial arrangement, thereby refining protein-ligand matching. Across multiple benchmarks, S$^2$Drug consistently improves virtual screening performance and achieves strong results on binding site prediction, demonstrating the value of bridging sequence and structure in contrastive learning.

<title>Correcting False Alarms from Unseen: Adapting Graph Anomaly Detectors at Test Time</title>

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to detect outliers in graph-structured data, has received increasing research attention recently. However, existing GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions, which is rarely valid in practice. In real-world scenarios, unseen but normal samples may emerge during deployment, leading to a normality shift that degrades the performance of GAD models trained on the original data. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that the degradation arises from (1) semantic confusion, where unseen normal samples are misinterpreted as anomalies due to their novel patterns, and (2) aggregation contamination, where the representations of seen normal nodes are distorted by unseen normals through message aggregation. While retraining or fine-tuning GAD models could be a potential solution to the above challenges, the high cost of model retraining and the difficulty of obtaining labeled data often render this approach impractical in real-world applications. To bridge the gap, we proposed a lightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting Unseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph aligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph attribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level shift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the estimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE significantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both synthetic and real unseen normal patterns.

Abstract: Fairness concerns are increasingly critical as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes applications. While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing data selection and model-based fairness methods in both fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

<title>Breaking Privacy in Federated Clustering: Perfect Input Reconstruction via Temporal Correlations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated clustering allows multiple parties to discover patterns in distributed data without sharing raw samples. To reduce overhead, many protocols disclose intermediate centroids during training. While often treated as harmless for efficiency, whether such disclosure compromises privacy remains an open question. Prior analyses modeled the problem as a so-called Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) and argued that centroid release may be safe, since classical HSSP attacks fail to recover inputs.
  We revisit this question and uncover a new leakage mechanism: temporal regularities in $k$-means iterations create exploitable structure that enables perfect input reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose Trajectory-Aware Reconstruction (TAR), an attack that combines temporal assignment information with algebraic analysis to recover exact original inputs. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence, supported by a practical attack, that centroid disclosure in federated clustering significantly compromises privacy, exposing a fundamental tension between privacy and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel equivariant graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed to predict the tensorial response properties of molecules. Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Explicit latent variable models provide a flexible yet powerful framework for data synthesis, enabling controlled manipulation of generative factors. With latent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can be further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich exploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured latent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of regularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models, reconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly combined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However, balancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates over AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over KLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior. We explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with explicit control over continuous musical attributes. We show that existing approaches struggle to jointly minimize both regularization objectives, whereas suitable attribute transformations can help achieve both controllability and regularization of the target latent dimensions.

<title>REACT-LLM: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Integration with Causal Features in Clinical Prognostic Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal learning each hold strong potential for clinical decision making (CDM). However, their synergy remains poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic benchmarks evaluating their integration in clinical risk prediction. In real-world healthcare, identifying features with causal influence on outcomes is crucial for actionable and trustworthy predictions. While recent work highlights LLMs' emerging causal reasoning abilities, there lacks comprehensive benchmarks to assess their causal learning and performance informed by causal features in clinical risk prediction. To address this, we introduce REACT-LLM, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether combining LLMs with causal features can enhance clinical prognostic performance and potentially outperform traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike existing LLM-clinical benchmarks that often focus on a limited set of outcomes, REACT-LLM evaluates 7 clinical outcomes across 2 real-world datasets, comparing 15 prominent LLMs, 6 traditional ML models, and 3 causal discovery (CD) algorithms. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably in clinical prognostics, they have not yet outperformed traditional ML models. Integrating causal features derived from CD algorithms into LLMs offers limited performance gains, primarily due to the strict assumptions of many CD methods, which are often violated in complex clinical data. While the direct integration yields limited improvement, our benchmark reveals a more promising synergy.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.

Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials entails navigating an immense combinatorial design space. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.

Abstract: Responding to disease outbreaks requires close surveillance of their trajectories, but outbreak detection is hindered by the high noise in epidemic time series. Aggregating information across data sources has shown great denoising ability in other fields, but remains underexplored in epidemiology. Here, we present LRTrend, an interpretable machine learning framework to identify outbreaks in real time. LRTrend effectively aggregates diverse health and behavioral data streams within one region and learns disease-specific epidemic networks to aggregate information across regions. We reveal diverse epidemic clusters and connections across the United States that are not well explained by commonly used human mobility networks and may be informative for future public health coordination. We apply LRTrend to 2 years of COVID-19 data in 305 hospital referral regions and frequently detect regional Delta and Omicron waves within 2 weeks of the outbreak's start, when case counts are a small fraction of the wave's resulting peak.

<title>Fuzzy Label: From Concept to Its Application in Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Label learning is a fundamental task in machine learning that aims to construct intelligent models using labeled data, encompassing traditional single-label and multi-label classification models. Traditional methods typically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., "yes/no") that specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in practical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty due to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities, and the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using simplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the expressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to better capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient fuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original data, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced representations. Based on this foundation, we present fuzzy-label-enhanced algorithms for both single-label and multi-label learning, using the classical K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and multi-label KNN algorithms as illustrative examples. Experimental results indicate that fuzzy labels can more effectively characterize the real-world labeling information and significantly enhance the performance of label learning models.

Abstract: Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract the GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a partition-based multi-stage fine-tuning framework designed to exploit inter-domain synergies while minimizing negative transfer. Our approach strategically partitions domains into subsets (stages) by balancing domain discrepancy, synergy, and model capacity constraints. We theoretically analyze the proposed framework and derive novel generalization bounds that justify our partitioning strategy. Extensive empirical evaluations on various language understanding tasks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in settings where ensuring robustness, fairness, or domain-specific properties is essential for regulation compliance and alignment with human values. However, especially on Neural Networks, property enforcement is very challenging, and existing methods are limited to specific constraints or local properties (defined around datapoints), or fail to provide full guarantees. We tackle these limitations by extending SMiLE, a recently proposed enforcement framework for NNs, to support global relational properties (defined over the entire input space). The proposed approach scales well with model complexity, accommodates general properties and backbones, and provides full satisfaction guarantees. We evaluate SMiLE on monotonicity, global robustness, and individual fairness, on synthetic and real data, for regression and classification tasks. Our approach is competitive with property-specific baselines in terms of accuracy and runtime, and strictly superior in terms of generality and level of guarantees. Overall, our results emphasize the potential of the SMiLE framework as a platform for future research and applications.

Abstract: Chronic pain is a global health challenge affecting millions of individuals, making it essential for physicians to have reliable and objective methods to measure the functional impact of clinical treatments. Traditionally used methods, like the numeric rating scale, while personalized and easy to use, are subjective due to their self-reported nature. Thus, this paper proposes DETECT (Data-Driven Evaluation of Treatments Enabled by Classification Transformers), a data-driven framework that assesses treatment success by comparing patient activities of daily life before and after treatment. We use DETECT on public benchmark datasets and simulated patient data from smartphone sensors. Our results demonstrate that DETECT is objective yet lightweight, making it a significant and novel contribution to clinical decision-making. By using DETECT, independently or together with other self-reported metrics, physicians can improve their understanding of their treatment impacts, ultimately leading to more personalized and responsive patient care.

Abstract: We propose a deep neural-operator framework for a general class of probability models. Under global Lipschitz conditions on the operator over the entire Euclidean space-and for a broad class of probabilistic models-we establish a universal approximation theorem with explicit network-size bounds for the proposed architecture. The underlying stochastic processes are required only to satisfy integrability and general tail-probability conditions. We verify these assumptions for both European and American option-pricing problems within the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE) framework, which in turn covers a broad class of operators arising from parabolic PDEs, with or without free boundaries. Finally, we present a numerical example for a basket of American options, demonstrating that the learned model produces optimal stopping boundaries for new strike prices without retraining.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental for multiple scientific domains, yet extracting causal information from real world data remains a significant challenge. Given the recent success on real data, we investigate whether TabPFN, a transformer-based tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic datasets generated from structural causal models, encodes causal information in its internal representations. We develop an adapter framework using a learnable decoder and causal tokens that extract causal signals from TabPFN's frozen embeddings and decode them into adjacency matrices for causal discovery. Our evaluations demonstrate that TabPFN's embeddings contain causal information, outperforming several traditional causal discovery algorithms, with such causal information being concentrated in mid-range layers. These findings establish a new direction for interpretable and adaptable foundation models and demonstrate the potential for leveraging pre-trained tabular models for causal discovery.

<title>The Few Govern the Many:Unveiling Few-Layer Dominance for Time Series Models</title>

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

<title>Understanding the role of depth in the neural tangent kernel for overparameterized neural networks</title>

Abstract: Overparameterized fully-connected neural networks have been shown to behave like kernel models when trained with gradient descent, under mild conditions on the width, the learning rate, and the parameter initialization. In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere. We empirically evaluate the order of magnitude in network depth required to observe this convergent behavior, and we describe the essential properties that enable the generalization of our results to other kernels.

<title>Multi-modal Dynamic Proxy Learning for Personalized Multiple Clustering</title>

Abstract: Multiple clustering aims to discover diverse latent structures from different perspectives, yet existing methods generate exhaustive clusterings without discerning user interest, necessitating laborious manual screening. Current multi-modal solutions suffer from static semantic rigidity: predefined candidate words fail to adapt to dataset-specific concepts, and fixed fusion strategies ignore evolving feature interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-DProxy, a novel multi-modal dynamic proxy learning framework that leverages cross-modal alignment through learnable textual proxies. Multi-DProxy introduces 1) gated cross-modal fusion that synthesizes discriminative joint representations by adaptively modeling feature interactions. 2) dual-constraint proxy optimization where user interest constraints enforce semantic consistency with domain concepts while concept constraints employ hard example mining to enhance cluster discrimination. 3) dynamic candidate management that refines textual proxies through iterative clustering feedback. Therefore, Multi-DProxy not only effectively captures a user's interest through proxies but also enables the identification of relevant clusterings with greater precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements over existing methods across a broad set of multi-clustering benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over video-only models. However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.

<title>MG-HGNN: A Heterogeneous GNN Framework for Indoor Wi-Fi Fingerprint-Based Localization</title>

Abstract: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is the primary representation of Wi-Fi fingerprints and serves as a crucial tool for indoor localization. However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Learning complex policies with Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by instability and slow convergence, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty of reward engineering. Imitation Learning (IL) from expert demonstrations bypasses this reliance on rewards. However, state-of-the-art IL methods, exemplified by Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)Ho et. al, suffer from severe sample inefficiency. This is a direct consequence of their foundational on-policy algorithms, such as TRPO Schulman et.al. In this work, we introduce an adversarial imitation learning algorithm that incorporates off-policy learning to improve sample efficiency. By combining an off-policy framework with auxiliary techniques specifically, double Q network based stabilization and value learning without reward function inference we demonstrate a reduction in the samples required to robustly match expert behavior.

<title>Can Training Dynamics of Scale-Invariant Neural Networks Be Explained by the Thermodynamics of an Ideal Gas?</title>

Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks remains a major open problem, with physics-inspired approaches offering promising insights. Building on this perspective, we develop a thermodynamic framework to describe the stationary distributions of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with weight decay for scale-invariant neural networks, a setting that both reflects practical architectures with normalization layers and permits theoretical analysis. We establish analogies between training hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, weight decay) and thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure, and volume. Starting with a simplified isotropic noise model, we uncover a close correspondence between SGD dynamics and ideal gas behavior, validated through theory and simulation. Extending to training of neural networks, we show that key predictions of the framework, including the behavior of stationary entropy, align closely with experimental observations. This framework provides a principled foundation for interpreting training dynamics and may guide future work on hyperparameter tuning and the design of learning rate schedulers.

Abstract: Few classical games have been regarded as such significant benchmarks of artificial intelligence as to have justified training costs in the millions of dollars. Among these, Stratego -- a board wargame exemplifying the challenge of strategic decision making under massive amounts of hidden information -- stands apart as a case where such efforts failed to produce performance at the level of top humans. This work establishes a step change in both performance and cost for Stratego, showing that it is now possible not only to reach the level of top humans, but to achieve vastly superhuman level -- and that doing so requires not an industrial budget, but merely a few thousand dollars. We achieved this result by developing general approaches for self-play reinforcement learning and test-time search under imperfect information.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods enhance LLM performance by efficiently filtering relevant context for LLMs, reducing hallucinations and inference cost. However, most existing RAG methods focus on single-step retrieval, which is often insufficient for answering complex questions that require multi-step search. Recently, multi-step retrieval approaches have emerged, typically involving the fine-tuning of small LLMs to perform multi-step retrieval. This type of fine-tuning is highly resource-intensive and does not enable the use of larger LLMs. In this work, we propose Q-RAG, a novel approach that fine-tunes the Embedder model for multi-step retrieval using reinforcement learning (RL). Q-RAG offers a competitive, resource-efficient alternative to existing multi-step retrieval methods for open-domain question answering and achieves state-of-the-art results on the popular long-context benchmarks Babilong and RULER for contexts up to 10M tokens.

Abstract: It introduces FractalNet, a fractal-inspired computational architectures for advanced large language model analysis that mainly challenges model diversity on a large scale in an efficient manner. The new set-up involves a template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus, models become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally efficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and resource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration.

Abstract: Building reliable computer-use agents requires grounding: accurately connecting natural language instructions to the correct on-screen elements. While large datasets exist for web and mobile interactions, high-quality resources for desktop environments are limited. To address this gap, we introduce GroundCUA, a large-scale desktop grounding dataset built from expert human demonstrations. It covers 87 applications across 12 categories and includes 56K screenshots, with every on-screen element carefully annotated for a total of over 3.56M human-verified annotations. From these demonstrations, we generate diverse instructions that capture a wide range of real-world tasks, providing high-quality data for model training. Using GroundCUA, we develop the GroundNext family of models that map instructions to their target UI elements. At both 3B and 7B scales, GroundNext achieves state-of-the-art results across five benchmarks using supervised fine-tuning, while requiring less than one-tenth the training data of prior work. Reinforcement learning post-training further improves performance, and when evaluated in an agentic setting on the OSWorld benchmark using o3 as planner, GroundNext attains comparable or superior results to models trained with substantially more data,. These results demonstrate the critical role of high-quality, expert-driven datasets in advancing general-purpose computer-use agents.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with deep test-time memorization modules, such as Titans and TTT, represent a promising, linearly-scaling paradigm distinct from Transformers. While these expressive models do not yet match the peak performance of state-of-the-art Transformers, their potential has been largely untapped due to prohibitively slow training and low hardware utilization. Existing parallelization methods force a fundamental conflict governed by the chunksize hyperparameter: large chunks boost speed but degrade performance, necessitating a fixed, suboptimal compromise. To solve this challenge, we introduce TNT, a novel training paradigm that decouples training efficiency from inference performance through a two-stage process. Stage one is an efficiency-focused pre-training phase utilizing a hierarchical memory. A global module processes large, hardware-friendly chunks for long-range context, while multiple parallel local modules handle fine-grained details. Crucially, by periodically resetting local memory states, we break sequential dependencies to enable massive context parallelization. Stage two is a brief fine-tuning phase where only the local memory modules are adapted to a smaller, high-resolution chunksize, maximizing accuracy with minimal overhead. Evaluated on Titans and TTT models, TNT achieves a substantial acceleration in training speed-up to 17 times faster than the most accurate baseline configuration - while simultaneously improving model accuracy. This improvement removes a critical scalability barrier, establishing a practical foundation for developing expressive RNNs and facilitating future work to close the performance gap with Transformers.

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

arXiv:2511.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains. In order to improve the efficiency of these methods, various methods have been developed that compute summaries or \emph{sketches} of the datasets. Certain domains, however, contain sensitive data which necessitates that the application of these statistical methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods have been developed for mitigating this problem. These techniques typically involve estimating a noisy version of the parameter vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets. We present differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.

<title>Consistency Is Not Always Correct: Towards Understanding the Role of Exploration in Post-Training Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07368</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models exhibit broad knowledge but limited task-specific reasoning, motivating post-training strategies such as RLVR and inference scaling with outcome or process reward models (ORM/PRM). While recent work highlights the role of exploration and entropy stability in improving pass@K, empirical evidence points to a paradox: RLVR and ORM/PRM typically reinforce existing tree-like reasoning paths rather than expanding the reasoning scope, raising the question of why exploration helps at all if no new patterns emerge.
  To reconcile this paradox, we adopt the perspective of Kim et al. (2025), viewing easy (e.g., simplifying a fraction) versus hard (e.g., discovering a symmetry) reasoning steps as low- versus high-probability Markov transitions, and formalize post-training dynamics through Multi-task Tree-structured Markov Chains (TMC). In this tractable model, pretraining corresponds to tree expansion, while post-training corresponds to chain-of-thought reweighting. We show that several phenomena recently observed in empirical studies arise naturally in this setting: (1) RLVR induces a squeezing effect, reducing reasoning entropy and forgetting some correct paths; (2) population rewards of ORM/PRM encourage consistency rather than accuracy, thereby favoring common patterns; and (3) certain rare, high-uncertainty reasoning paths by the base model are responsible for solving hard problem instances.
  Together, these explain why exploration -- even when confined to the base model's reasoning scope -- remains essential: it preserves access to rare but crucial reasoning traces needed for difficult cases, which are squeezed out by RLVR or unfavored by inference scaling. Building on this, we further show that exploration strategies such as rejecting easy instances and KL regularization help preserve rare reasoning traces. Empirical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.

<title>Provable Benefit of Curriculum in Transformer Tree-Reasoning Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Recent curriculum techniques in the post-training stage of LLMs have been widely observed to outperform non-curriculum approaches in enhancing reasoning performance, yet a principled understanding of why and to what extent they work remains elusive. To address this gap, we develop a theoretical framework grounded in the intuition that progressively learning through manageable steps is more efficient than directly tackling a hard reasoning task, provided each stage stays within the model's effective competence. Under mild complexity conditions linking consecutive curriculum stages, we show that curriculum post-training avoids the exponential complexity bottleneck.
  To substantiate this result, drawing insights from the Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) solving mathematical problems such as Countdown and parity, we model CoT generation as a states-conditioned autoregressive reasoning tree, define a uniform-branching base model to capture pretrained behavior, and formalize curriculum stages as either depth-increasing (longer reasoning chains) or hint-decreasing (shorter prefixes) subtasks. Our analysis shows that, under outcome-only reward signals, reinforcement learning finetuning achieves high accuracy with polynomial sample complexity, whereas direct learning suffers from an exponential bottleneck. We further establish analogous guarantees for test-time scaling, where curriculum-aware querying reduces both reward oracle calls and sampling cost from exponential to polynomial order.

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints.

<title>A Diffusion Model to Shrink Proteins While Maintaining Their Function</title>

Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.

<title>C3PO: Optimized Large Language Model Cascades with Probabilistic Cost Constraints for Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on complex reasoning tasks, but their high inference cost remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised training with labeled data, offer no theoretical generalization guarantees, and provide limited control over test-time computational cost. We introduce C3PO (Cost Controlled Cascaded Prediction Optimization), a self-supervised framework for optimizing LLM cascades under probabilistic cost constraints. By focusing on minimizing regret with respect to the most powerful model (MPM), C3PO avoids the need for labeled data by constructing a cascade using only unlabeled model outputs. It leverages conformal prediction to bound the probability that inference cost exceeds a user-specified budget. We provide theoretical guarantees on both cost control and generalization error, and show that our optimization procedure is effective even with small calibration sets. Empirically, C3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, BigBench-Hard and AIME, outperforming strong LLM cascading baselines in both accuracy and cost-efficiency. Our results demonstrate that principled, label-free cascade optimization can enable scalable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Simulating trajectories of multi-particle systems on complex energy landscapes is a central task in molecular dynamics (MD) and drug discovery, but remains challenging at scale due to computationally expensive and long simulations. Previous approaches leverage techniques such as flow or Schr\"odinger bridge matching to implicitly learn joint trajectories through data snapshots. However, many systems, including biomolecular systems and heterogeneous cell populations, undergo dynamic interactions that evolve over their trajectory and cannot be captured through static snapshots. To close this gap, we introduce Entangled Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (EntangledSBM), a framework that learns the first- and second-order stochastic dynamics of interacting, multi-particle systems where the direction and magnitude of each particle's path depend dynamically on the paths of the other particles. We define the Entangled Schr\"odinger Bridge (EntangledSB) problem as solving a coupled system of bias forces that entangle particle velocities. We show that our framework accurately simulates heterogeneous cell populations under perturbations and rare transitions in high-dimensional biomolecular systems.

<title>Routing Manifold Alignment Improves Generalization of Mixture-of-Experts LLMs</title>

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been widely adopted in recent large language models since it can efficiently scale up the model capability without increasing the inference cost. However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights with that of task embedding can effectively reduce the gap and improve MoE LLMs' generalization performance. Our method, "Routing Manifold Alignment (RoMA)", introduces an additional manifold regularization term in the post-training objective and only requires lightweight finetuning of routers (with other parameters frozen). Specifically, the regularization encourages the routing weights of each sample to be close to those of its successful neighbors (whose routing weights lead to correct answers) in a task embedding space. Consequently, samples targeting similar tasks will share similar expert choices across layers. Building such bindings between tasks and experts over different samples is essential to achieve better generalization. Moreover, RoMA demonstrates the advantage of unifying the task understanding (by embedding models) with solution generation (by MoE LLMs). In experiments, we finetune routers in OLMoE, DeepSeekMoE, and Qwen3-MoE using RoMA. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks and extensive comparisons with baselines show the substantial improvement brought by RoMA.

Abstract: This study presents a novel Multi-Modal Graph Neural Network (MM-GNN) framework for socially aware music recommendation, designed to enhance personalization and foster community-based engagement. The proposed model introduces a fusion-free deep mutual learning strategy that aligns modality-specific representations from lyrics, audio, and visual data while maintaining robustness against missing modalities. A heterogeneous graph structure is constructed to capture both user-song interactions and user-user social relationships, enabling the integration of individual preferences with social influence. Furthermore, emotion-aware embeddings derived from acoustic and textual signals contribute to emotionally aligned recommendations. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various performance metrics. Ablation studies further validate the critical impact of each model component, confirming the effectiveness of the framework in delivering accurate and socially contextualized music recommendations.

Abstract: Given that conventional recommenders, while deeply effective, rely on large distributed systems pre-trained on aggregate user data, incorporating new data necessitates large training cycles, making them slow to adapt to real-time user feedback and often lacking transparency in recommendation rationale. We explore the performance of smaller personal models trained on per-user data using weightless neural networks (WNNs), an alternative to neural backpropagation that enable continuous learning by using neural networks as a state machine rather than a system with pretrained weights. We contrast our approach against a classic weighted system, also on a per-user level, and standard collaborative filtering, achieving competitive levels of accuracy on a subset of the MovieLens dataset. We close with a discussion of how weightless systems can be developed to augment centralized systems to achieve higher subjective accuracy through recommenders more directly tunable by end-users.

Abstract: Implantable devices for reliable intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) require efficient, accurate, and real-time detection of seizures. Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation. This work highlights the hardware advantages of sparse HDC, demonstrating its potential to enable smaller brain implants with a substantially extended battery life compared to the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity

Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

<title>Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

Abstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Abstract: Music language models (Music LMs), like vision language models, leverage multimodal representations to answer natural language queries about musical audio recordings. Although Music LMs are reportedly improving, we find that current evaluations fail to capture whether their answers are correct. Specifically, for all Music LMs that we examine, widely-used evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore fail to measure anything beyond linguistic fluency of the model's responses. To measure the true performance of Music LMs, we propose (1) a better general-purpose evaluation metric for Music LMs adapted to the music domain and (2) a factual evaluation framework to quantify the correctness of a Music LM's responses. Our framework is agnostic to the modality of the question-answering model and could be generalized to quantify performance in other open-ended question-answering domains. We use open datasets in our experiments and will release all code on publication.

Abstract: Existing Multi-view Clustering (MVC) methods based on subspace learning focus on consensus representation learning while neglecting the inherent topological structure of data. Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations. The code will be provided at https://github.com/texttao/MCFCN.

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.

Abstract: When Austrian hydropower production plummeted by 44% in early 2025 due to reduced snowpack, it exposed a critical vulnerability: standard meteorological and climatological datasets systematically fail in mountain regions that hold untapped renewable potential. This perspectives paper evaluates emerging solutions to the Alpine energy-climate data gap, analyzing datasets from global reanalyses (ERA5, 31 km) to kilometre-scale Digital Twins (Climate DT, Extremes DT, 4.4 km), regional reanalyses (ARA, 2.5 km), and next-generation AI weather prediction models (AIFS, 31 km). The multi-resolution assessment reveals that no single dataset excels universally: coarse reanalyses provide essential climatologies but miss valley-scale processes, while Digital Twins resolve Alpine dynamics yet remain computationally demanding. Effective energy planning therefore requires strategic dataset combinations validated against energy-relevant indices such as population-weighted extremes, wind-gust return periods, and Alpine-adjusted storm thresholds. A key frontier is sub-hourly (10-15 min) temporal resolution to match grid-operation needs. Six evidence-based recommendations outline pathways for bridging spatial and temporal scales. As renewable deployment expands globally into complex terrain, the Alpine region offers transferable perspectives for tackling identical forecasting and climate analysis challenges in mountainous regions worldwide.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its extensions have become indispensable tools for visualizing the evidence behind deep network predictions. However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/finallyupper/beyond-softmax.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

<title>Who Evaluates AI's Social Impacts? Mapping Coverage and Gaps in First and Third Party Evaluations</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

<title>Registration-Free Monitoring of Unstructured Point Cloud Data via Intrinsic Geometrical Properties</title>

Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.

<title>Optimizing Diversity and Quality through Base-Aligned Model Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

Abstract: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal. The code is available at https://sunblaze-ucb.github.io/VMDT-page/.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable framework for zero-shot adaptive control over parametric families of nonlinear dynamical systems. Our approach integrates a function encoder-based neural ODE (FE-NODE) for modeling system dynamics with a differentiable predictive control (DPC) for offline self-supervised learning of explicit control policies. The FE-NODE captures nonlinear behaviors in state transitions and enables zero-shot adaptation to new systems without retraining, while the DPC efficiently learns control policies across system parameterizations, thus eliminating costly online optimization common in classical model predictive control. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and online adaptability of the proposed method across a range of nonlinear systems with varying parametric scenarios, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose tool for fast zero-shot adaptive control.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan showed that, in principle, language generation is always possible: with sufficiently many positive examples, a learner can eventually produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a target language. However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

<title>DRAGON: Guard LLM Unlearning in Context via Negative Detection and Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation; however, most existing methods rely on large-scale expert annotations and necessitate retraining to handle new objects. We present VLAD-Grasp, a Vision-Language model Assisted zero-shot approach for Detecting grasps. From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod "impales" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

<title>EGG-SR: Embedding Symbolic Equivalence into Symbolic Regression via Equality Graph</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression seeks to uncover physical laws from experimental data by searching for closed-form expressions, which is an important task in AI-driven scientific discovery. Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\log(x_1^2)+\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\log(x_1)+3\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

Abstract: A person's gaze offers valuable insights into their focus of attention, level of social engagement, and confidence. In this work, we investigate how contextual cues combined with visual scene and facial information can be effectively utilized to predict and interpret social gaze patterns during conversational interactions. We introduce CSGaze, a context aware multimodal approach that leverages facial, scene information as complementary inputs to enhance social gaze pattern prediction from multi-person images. The model also incorporates a fine-grained attention mechanism centered on the principal speaker, which helps in better modeling social gaze dynamics. Experimental results show that CSGaze performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on GP-Static, UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO. Our findings highlight the role of contextual cues in improving social gaze prediction. Additionally, we provide initial explainability through generated attention scores, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. We also demonstrate our model's generalizability by testing our model on open set datasets that demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in perception systems for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to various safety concerns, including generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks, which can lead to hazardous failures. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of runtime safety monitoring approaches, which operate in parallel to DNNs during inference to detect these safety concerns without modifying the DNN itself. We categorize existing methods into three main groups: Monitoring inputs, internal representations, and outputs. We analyze the state-of-the-art for each category, identify strengths and limitations, and map methods to the safety concerns they address. In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Validation plays a crucial role in the clustering process. Many different internal validity indexes exist for the purpose of determining the best clustering solution(s) from a given collection of candidates, e.g., as produced by different algorithms or different algorithm hyper-parameters. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark study of 26 internal validity indexes, which includes highly popular classic indexes as well as more recently developed ones. We adopted an enhanced revision of the methodology presented in Vendramin et al. (2010), developed here to address several shortcomings of this previous work. This overall new approach consists of three complementary custom-tailored evaluation sub-methodologies, each of which has been designed to assess specific aspects of an index's behaviour while preventing potential biases of the other sub-methodologies. Each sub-methodology features two complementary measures of performance, alongside mechanisms that allow for an in-depth investigation of more complex behaviours of the internal validity indexes under study. Additionally, a new collection of 16177 datasets has been produced, paired with eight widely-used clustering algorithms, for a wider applicability scope and representation of more diverse clustering scenarios.

Abstract: Stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) play an important role in many scientific and engineering applications. Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step. We illustrate the achieved benefits using multiple examples.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

<title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Symmetric Correlated Spiked Wigner Model</title>

Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked Wigner matrices. Our model consists of observations
  $$
  X = \tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \,, \quad Y = \tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \,.
  $$
  where $x,y \in \mathbb R^n$ are signal vectors with norm $\|x\|,\|y\| \approx\sqrt{n}$ and correlation $\langle x,y \rangle \approx \rho\|x\|\|y\|$, while $W,Z$ are independent Gaussian noise matrices. We propose an efficient algorithm that succeeds whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)>1$, where
  $$
  F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=\max\Big\{ \lambda,\mu, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,.
  $$
  Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from $X$ alone or $y$ from $Y$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic result with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)<1$, all algorithms based on {\em low-degree polynomials} fails to distinguish $(X,Y)$ with two independent Wigner matrices. This low-degree analysis strongly suggests that $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=1$ is the precise computation threshold for this problem.

<title>Visual Exploration of Feature Relationships in Sparse Autoencoders with Curated Concepts</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) through the sparse directions they learn. However, the sheer number of extracted directions makes comprehensive exploration intractable. While conventional embedding techniques such as UMAP can reveal global structure, they suffer from limitations including high-dimensional compression artifacts, overplotting, and misleading neighborhood distortions. In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.

<title>Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using a Licensing Oracle</title>

Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

Abstract: Muon optimizer has demonstrated robust results in pretraining of language models but its performance in finetuning of existing public pretrained models is not yet explored. Currently, Muon is used along with AdamW introducing a scope of improvement for adopting all parameters inside Muon. We introduce MuonAll, which incorporates all the parameters inside Muon by transforming into 2D matrices. We conduct extensive finetuning experiments across publicly available language models with model sizes upto half billion parameters. Muon and MuonAll perform at par with AdamW across major benchmarks, highlighting their effectiveness as alternative optimizers. We open-source the distributed implementations of Muon and MuonAll, available at https://github.com/Saurabh750/optimizer

Abstract: Accurate thermospheric density prediction is crucial for reliable satellite operations in Low Earth Orbits, especially at high solar and geomagnetic activity. Physics-based models such as TIE-GCM offer high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while empirical models like NRLMSIS are efficient yet lack predictive power. This work presents a transformer-based model that forecasts densities up to three days ahead and is intended as a drop-in replacement for an empirical baseline. Unlike recent approaches, it avoids spatial reduction and complex input pipelines, operating directly on a compact input set. Validated on real-world data, the model improves key prediction metrics and shows potential to support mission planning.

<title>A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Transformation Legality</title>

Abstract: Compilers must check the legality of code transformations to guarantee the correctness of applying a sequence of code transformations to a given code. While such a legality check needs to be precisely computed in general, we can use an approximate legality prediction model in certain cases, such as training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for schedule prediction. In this paper, we propose an approximate method for legality checks. We propose a novel DL model for predicting the legality of transformations. The model takes the code representation and a list of transformations as input and predicts whether applying those transformations to the code is legal. We implement and evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set of randomly generated programs. To further evaluate the model in a practical scenario, we used the model to replace the legality check used during the training of an RL agent designed for automatic code optimization. We demonstrate that such a replacement enables the agent to train on twice as many steps, resulting in faster training and reducing resource usage by approximately 80\% for CPU and 35\% for RAM. The agent trained using this approach maintains comparable performance, with only a 4\% reduction on benchmarks from the Polybench suite compared to the traditional method.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children plays a crucial role in improving outcomes in education and mental health. Diagnosing ADHD using neuroimaging data, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous presentations and overlapping symptoms with other conditions. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning approach that adapts a large-scale 3D convolutional foundation model, pre-trained on CT images, to an MRI-based ADHD classification task. Our method introduces Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in 3D by factorizing 3D convolutional kernels into 2D low-rank updates, dramatically reducing trainable parameters while achieving superior performance. In a five-fold cross-validated evaluation on a public diffusion MRI database, our 3D LoRA fine-tuning strategy achieved state-of-the-art results, with one model variant reaching 71.9% accuracy and another attaining an AUC of 0.716. Both variants use only 1.64 million trainable parameters (over 113x fewer than a fully fine-tuned foundation model). Our results represent one of the first successful cross-modal (CT-to-MRI) adaptations of a foundation model in neuroimaging, establishing a new benchmark for ADHD classification while greatly improving efficiency.

<title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.

<title>Time Matters: A Novel Real-Time Long- and Short-term User Interest Model for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core task in online personalization platform. A key step for CTR prediction is to learn accurate user representation to capture their interests. Generally, the interest expressed by a user is time-variant, i.e., a user activates different interests at different time. However, most previous CTR prediction methods overlook the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, resulting in what they actually learn is the mixture of the interests expressed by the user at all time, rather than the real-time interest at the certain prediction time. To capture the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, in this paper we investigate users' interest evolution from the perspective of the whole time line and develop two regular patterns: periodic pattern and time-point pattern. Based on the two patterns, we propose a novel time-aware long- and short-term user interest modeling method to model users' dynamic interests at different time. Extensive experiments on public datasets as well as an industrial dataset verify the effectiveness of exploiting the two patterns and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art ones.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of hyperparameter estimation within the empirical Bayes framework (EBF) for sparse learning. By studying the influence of hyperpriors on the solution of EBF, we establish a theoretical connection between the choice of the hyperprior and the sparsity as well as the local optimality of the resulting solutions. We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise. Based on this analysis, we adopt a proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guaranties for both convex and concave hyperpriors. Extensive numerical tests on two-dimensional image deblurring problems demonstrate that introducing appropriate hyperpriors significantly promotes the sparsity of the solution and enhances restoration accuracy. Furthermore, we illustrate the influence of the noise level and the ill-posedness of inverse problems to EBF solutions.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for sampling from the Gibbs distribution in finite-dimensional spaces have progressed quickly, yet theory and algorithmic design for infinite-dimensional function spaces remain limited. This gap persists despite their strong potential for sampling the paths of conditional diffusion processes, enabling efficient simulation of trajectories of diffusion processes that respect rare events or boundary constraints. In this work, we present the adjoint sampler for infinite-dimensional function spaces, a stochastic optimal control-based diffusion sampler that operates in function space and targets Gibbs-type distributions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our Functional Adjoint Sampler (FAS) generalizes Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to Hilbert spaces based on a SOC theory called stochastic maximum principle, yielding a simple and scalable matching-type objective for a functional representation. We show that FAS achieves superior transition path sampling performance across synthetic potential and real molecular systems, including Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.

Abstract: This position paper argues that setting the privacy budget in differential privacy should not be viewed as an important limitation of differential privacy compared to alternative methods for privacy-preserving machine learning. The so-called problem of interpreting the privacy budget is often presented as a major hindrance to the wider adoption of differential privacy in real-world deployments and is sometimes used to promote alternative mitigation techniques for data protection. We believe this misleads decision-makers into choosing unsafe methods. We argue that the difficulty in interpreting privacy budgets does not stem from the definition of differential privacy itself, but from the intrinsic difficulty of estimating privacy risks in context, a challenge that any rigorous method for privacy risk assessment face. Moreover, we claim that any sound method for estimating privacy risks should, given the current state of research, be expressible within the differential privacy framework or justify why it cannot.

Abstract: Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.

<title>What Makes Reasoning Invalid: Echo Reflection Mitigation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

The Transformer achieves accurate reconstructions on smooth black hole geometries and extrapolates to horizonless backgrounds. We describe the architecture and data generation process, and we quantify accuracy on both $f(z)$ and the reconstructed $S(\ell)$.

Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes are considered useful for describing complex nonlinear statistical dependencies among variables in real-world data. However, effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference with these models have not yet been established, except for several simple cases. In this study, we show that, compared with the slow inference achieved with existing program libraries, the performance of Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) can be drastically improved by optimising the computation order according to the model structure and dynamically programming the eigendecomposition. This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator. We numerically demonstrate that RMHMC effectively samples from the posterior, allowing the calculation of model evidence, in a Bayesian logistic regression on simulated data and in the estimation of propensity functions for the American national medical expenditure data using several Bayesian multiple-kernel models. These results lay a foundation for implementing effective Monte Carlo algorithms for analysing real-world data with Gaussian processes, and highlight the need to develop a customisable library set that allows users to incorporate dynamically programmed objects and finely optimises the mode of automatic differentiation depending on the model structure.

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy). Codes and weights are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/SofT-GRPO-master

Abstract: Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Abstract: As AI moves beyond text, large language models (LLMs) increasingly power vision, audio, and document understanding; however, their high inference costs hinder real-time, scalable deployment. Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

<title>Countering Multi-modal Representation Collapse through Rank-targeted Fusion</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

<title>EchoMark: Perceptual Acoustic Environment Transfer with Watermark-Embedded Room Impulse Response</title>

Abstract: Acoustic Environment Matching (AEM) is the task of transferring clean audio into a target acoustic environment, enabling engaging applications such as audio dubbing and auditory immersive virtual reality (VR). Recovering similar room impulse response (RIR) directly from reverberant speech offers more accessible and flexible AEM solution. However, this capability also introduces vulnerabilities of arbitrary ``relocation" if misused by malicious user, such as facilitating advanced voice spoofing attacks or undermining the authenticity of recorded evidence. To address this issue, we propose EchoMark, the first deep learning-based AEM framework that generates perceptually similar RIRs with embedded watermark. Our design tackle the challenges posed by variable RIR characteristics, such as different durations and energy decays, by operating in the latent domain. By jointly optimizing the model with a perceptual loss for RIR reconstruction and a loss for watermark detection, EchoMark achieves both high-quality environment transfer and reliable watermark recovery. Experiments on diverse datasets validate that EchoMark achieves room acoustic parameter matching performance comparable to FiNS, the state-of-the-art RIR estimator. Furthermore, a high Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.22 out of 5, watermark detection accuracy exceeding 99\%, and bit error rates (BER) below 0.3\% collectively demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoMark in preserving perceptual quality while ensuring reliable watermark embedding.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

Abstract: Supply chain disruptions and volatile demand pose significant challenges to the UK automotive industry, which relies heavily on Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing. While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating. This work provides mathematical validation for practitioner observations and establishes a formal framework for understanding AI-driven supply chain resilience, while identifying critical boundary conditions for successful implementation.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices, making their safety alignment crucial yet challenging. Current shallow alignment methods that rely on direct refusal of malicious queries fail to provide robust protection, particularly against adversarial jailbreaks. While deliberative safety reasoning alignment offers deeper alignment for defending against sophisticated attacks, effectively implanting such reasoning capability in SLMs with limited capabilities remains an open challenge. Moreover, safety reasoning incurs significant computational overhead as models apply reasoning to nearly all queries, making it impractical for resource-constrained edge deployment scenarios that demand rapid responses. We propose EASE, a novel framework that enables practical and Efficient safety Alignment for Small languagE models. Our approach first identifies the optimal safety reasoning teacher that can effectively distill safety reasoning capabilities to SLMs. We then align models to selectively activate safety reasoning for dangerous adversarial jailbreak queries while providing direct responses to straightforward malicious queries and general helpful tasks. This selective mechanism enables small models to maintain robust safety guarantees against sophisticated attacks while preserving computational efficiency for benign interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that EASE reduces jailbreak attack success rates by up to 17% compared to shallow alignment methods while reducing inference overhead by up to 90% compared to deliberative safety reasoning alignment, making it practical for SLMs real-world edge deployments.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as planners for language-instructed agents, generating sequences of actions to accomplish natural language tasks. However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

Abstract: Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.

Abstract: The convergence of statistical learning and molecular physics is transforming our approach to modeling biomolecular systems. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) offers a systematic framework that integrates data-driven inference with physical constraints, resulting in models that are accurate, mechanistic, generalizable, and able to extrapolate beyond observed domains. This review surveys recent advances in physics-informed neural networks and operator learning, differentiable molecular simulation, and hybrid physics-ML potentials, with emphasis on long-timescale kinetics, rare events, and free-energy estimation. We frame these approaches as solutions to the "biomolecular closure problem", recovering unresolved interactions beyond classical force fields while preserving thermodynamic consistency and mechanistic interpretability. We examine theoretical foundations, tools and frameworks, computational trade-offs, and unresolved issues, including model expressiveness and stability. We outline prospective research avenues at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and computational chemistry, contending that future advancements will depend on mechanistic inductive biases, and integrated differentiable physical learning frameworks for biomolecular simulation and discovery.

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, underscores the need to distinguish LLM-generated text from human-written content to mitigate the spread of misinformation and misuse in education. One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is both effective and robust in accurately segmenting texts containing a mixture of watermarked and non-watermarked content.

Abstract: Accurate Channel State Information (CSI) is critical for Hybrid Beamforming (HBF) tasks. However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF. Experiments on DeepMIMO urban datasets demonstrate the proposed models' superior generalization, scalability, and robustness across various HBF tasks with perfect and imperfect CSI.

Abstract: In high-stakes information domains such as healthcare, where large language models (LLMs) can produce hallucinations or misinformation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been proposed as a mitigation strategy, grounding model outputs in external, domain-specific documents. Yet, this approach can introduce errors when source documents contain outdated or contradictory information. This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers. These results highlight that retrieval similarity alone is insufficient for reliable medical RAG and underscore the need for contradiction-aware filtering strategies to ensure trustworthy responses in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Beside the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, the Adam optimizer due to Kingma & Ba (2014) is currently probably the best-known optimization method for the training of deep neural networks in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Despite the popularity and the success of Adam it remains an \emph{open research problem} to provide a rigorous convergence analysis for Adam even for the class of strongly convex SOPs. In one of the main results of this work we establish convergence rates for Adam in terms of the number of gradient steps (convergence rate \nicefrac{1}{2} w.r.t. the size of the learning rate), the size of the mini-batches (convergence rate 1 w.r.t. the size of the mini-batches), and the size of the second moment parameter of Adam (convergence rate 1 w.r.t. the distance of the second moment parameter to 1) for the class of strongly convex SOPs. In a further main result of this work, which we refer to as \emph{Adam symmetry theorem}, we illustrate the optimality of the established convergence rates by proving for a special class of simple quadratic strongly convex SOPs that Adam converges as the number of gradient steps increases to infinity to the solution of the SOP (the unique minimizer of the strongly convex objective function) if and \emph{only} if the random variables in the SOP (the data in the SOP) are \emph{symmetrically distributed}. In particular, in the standard case where the random variables in the SOP are not symmetrically distributed we \emph{disprove} that Adam converges to the minimizer of the SOP as the number of Adam steps increases to infinity. We also complement the conclusions of our convergence analysis and the Adam symmetry theorem by several numerical simulations that indicate the sharpness of the established convergence rates and that illustrate the practical appearance of the phenomena revealed in the \emph{Adam symmetry theorem}.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) improve neural network interpretability by introducing an intermediate layer that maps human-understandable concepts to predictions. Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. Moreover, the model generalizes well to unseen concepts with just a single epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong adaptability and flexibility.

Abstract: Random forests are a statistical learning technique that use bootstrap aggregation to average high-variance and low-bias trees. Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a high-fidelity evaluation framework for machine learning (ML)-based classification of cyber-attacks and physical faults using electromagnetic transient simulations with digital substation emulation at 4.8 kHz. Twelve ML models, including ensemble algorithms and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were trained on labeled time-domain measurements and evaluated in a real-time streaming environment designed for sub-cycle responsiveness. The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage). These findings demonstrate that offline accuracy alone is an unreliable indicator of field readiness and underscore the need for realistic testing and inference pipelines to ensure dependable classification in inverter-based resources (IBR)-rich networks.

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

<title>Bilevel Learning via Inexact Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a central tool in machine learning for high-dimensional hyperparameter tuning. Its applications are vast; for instance, in imaging it can be used for learning data-adaptive regularizers and optimizing forward operators in variational regularization. These problems are large in many ways: a lot of data is usually available to train a large number of parameters, calling for stochastic gradient-based algorithms. However, exact gradients with respect to parameters (so-called hypergradients) are not available, and their precision is usually linearly related to computational cost. Hence, algorithms must solve the problem efficiently without unnecessary precision. The design of such methods is still not fully understood, especially regarding how accuracy requirements and step size schedules affect theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Existing approaches introduce stochasticity at both the upper level (e.g., in sampling or mini-batch estimates) and the lower level (e.g., in solving the inner problem) to improve generalization, but they typically fix the number of lower-level iterations, which conflicts with asymptotic convergence assumptions. In this work, we advance the theory of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization. We prove convergence and establish rates under decaying accuracy and step size schedules, showing that with optimal configurations convergence occurs at an $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/4})$ rate in expectation. Experiments on image denoising and inpainting with convex ridge regularizers and input-convex networks confirm our analysis: decreasing step sizes improve stability, accuracy scheduling is more critical than step size strategy, and adaptive preconditioning (e.g., Adam) further boosts performance. These results bridge theory and practice, providing convergence guarantees and practical guidance for large-scale imaging problems.

Abstract: Query optimization has been studied using machine learning, reinforcement learning, and, more recently, graph-based convolutional networks. Ontology, as a structured, information-rich knowledge representation, can provide context, particularly in learning problems. This paper presents OntoTune, an ontology-based platform for enhancing learning for query optimization. By connecting SQL queries, database metadata, and statistics, the ontology developed in this research is promising in capturing relationships and important determinants of query performance. This research also develops a method to embed ontologies while preserving as much of the relationships and key information as possible, before feeding it into learning algorithms such as tree-based and graph-based convolutional networks. A case study shows how OntoTune's ontology-driven learning delivers performance gains compared with database system default query execution.

<title>HEDN: A Hard-Easy Dual Network with Task Difficulty Assessment for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Multi-source domain adaptation represents an effective approach to addressing individual differences in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. However, existing methods treat all source domains equally, neglecting the varying transfer difficulties between different source domains and the target domain. This oversight can lead to suboptimal adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hard-Easy Dual Network (HEDN), which dynamically identifies "Hard Source" and "Easy Source" through a Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism and establishes two specialized knowledge adaptation branches. Specifically, the Hard Network is dedicated to handling "Hard Source" with higher transfer difficulty by aligning marginal distribution differences between source and target domains. Conversely, the Easy Network focuses on "Easy Source" with low transfer difficulty, utilizing a prototype classifier to model intra-class clustering structures while generating reliable pseudo-labels for the target domain through a prototype-guided label propagation algorithm. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, SEED and SEED-IV, demonstrate that HEDN achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, with average accuracies of 93.58\% on SEED and 79.82\% on SEED-IV, respectively. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of HEDN in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.

Abstract: Modern data-driven recommendation systems risk memorizing sensitive user behavioral patterns, raising privacy concerns. Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/Juniper42/L2UnRank.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

Abstract: We establish the convergence of the deep actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm presented in [Angiuli et al., 2023a] in the setting of continuous state and action spaces with an infinite discrete-time horizon. This algorithm provides solutions to Mean Field Game (MFG) or Mean Field Control (MFC) problems depending on the ratio between two learning rates: one for the value function and the other for the mean field term. In the MFC case, to rigorously identify the limit, we introduce a discretization of the state and action spaces, following the approach used in the finite-space case in [Angiuli et al., 2023b]. The convergence proofs rely on a generalization of the two-timescale framework introduced in [Borkar, 1997]. We further extend our convergence results to Mean Field Control Games, which involve locally cooperative and globally competitive populations. Finally, we present numerical experiments for linear-quadratic problems in one and two dimensions, for which explicit solutions are available.

Abstract: Attention is a core component of transformer architecture, whether encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder model. However, the standard softmax attention often produces noisy probability distribution, which can impair effective feature selection at every layer of these models, particularly for long contexts. We propose Focal Attention, a simple yet effective modification that sharpens the attention distribution by controlling the softmax temperature, either as a fixed hyperparameter or as a learnable parameter during training. This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length. Across diverse benchmarks, it achieves the same accuracy with up to 42% fewer parameters or 33% less training data. On long-context tasks, it delivers substantial relative improvements ranging from 17% to 82%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world applications.

<title>P3-LLM: An Integrated NPU-PIM Accelerator for LLM Inference Using Hybrid Numerical Formats</title>

Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively. Our quantization code is available at https://github.com/yc2367/P3-LLM.git

Abstract: Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Most of the Natural Language Processing sys- tems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.

Abstract: Diffusion models recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for recommender systems, offering state-of-the-art performance by modeling the generative process of user-item interactions. However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios. The source code and datasets are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReFiT-4C60.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models. The data, code, and 3D models are available online: https://tum-gis.github.io/TrueCity/

Abstract: Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices, spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder. However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.

Abstract: Early cancer detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and 18F FDG PET/CT imaging plays a vital role by combining metabolic and anatomical information. Accurate lesion detection remains challenging due to the need to identify multiple lesions of varying sizes. In this study, we investigate the effect of adding anatomy prior information to deep learning-based lesion detection models. In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the vision transformer. Moreover, we observe that Swin Transformer does not offer clear advantages over conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders used in nnDetection. These findings highlight the critical role of the anatomical context in cancer lesion detection, especially in CNN-based models.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications this is inadequate. For compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified - complete evidence. We perform a case study on a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. We show that individual models typically recover only subsets of complete evidence and that aggregating evidence from several models improves evidence recall from $\sim$0.60 (single best model) to $\sim$0.86 (ensemble). We analyze the recall-precision trade-off, the role of training with evidence, dynamic ensembles with certainty thresholds, and discuss implications.

Abstract: The opaque nature of deep learning models presents significant challenges for the ethical deployment of hate speech detection systems. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.

Abstract: Large-scale visual out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has witnessed remarkable progress by leveraging vision-language models such as CLIP. However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

<title>Sample-efficient quantum error mitigation via classical learning surrogates</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technology have enriched our daily lives, with high-quality and human-like audio widely adopted across real-world applications. However, malicious exploitation like voice-cloning fraud poses severe security risks. Existing defense techniques struggle to address the production large language model (LLM)-based speech synthesis. While previous studies have considered the protection for fine-tuning synthesizers, they assume manually annotated transcripts. Given the labor intensity of manual annotation, end-to-end (E2E) systems leveraging automatic speech recognition (ASR) to generate transcripts are becoming increasingly prevalent, e.g., voice cloning via commercial APIs. Therefore, this E2E speech synthesis also requires new security mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose E2E-VGuard, a proactive defense framework for two emerging threats: (1) production LLM-based speech synthesis, and (2) the novel attack arising from ASR-driven E2E scenarios. Specifically, we employ the encoder ensemble with a feature extractor to protect timbre, while ASR-targeted adversarial examples disrupt pronunciation. Moreover, we incorporate the psychoacoustic model to ensure perturbative imperceptibility. For a comprehensive evaluation, we test 16 open-source synthesizers and 3 commercial APIs across Chinese and English datasets, confirming E2E-VGuard's effectiveness in timbre and pronunciation protection. Real-world deployment validation is also conducted. Our code and demo page are available at https://wxzyd123.github.io/e2e-vguard/.

<title>A Provably-Correct and Robust Convex Model for Smooth Separable NMF</title>

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for nonnegative data, with applications such as hyperspectral unmixing and topic modeling. NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.However, conventional LoRA adapters are typically trained for a single task, limiting their applicability in real-world settings where inputs may span diverse and unpredictable domains. At inference time, existing approaches combine multiple LoRAs for improving performance on diverse tasks, while usually requiring labeled data or additional task-specific training, which is expensive at scale. In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly. Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Vector data trading is essential for cross-domain learning with vector databases, yet it remains largely unexplored. We study this problem under online learning, where sellers face uncertain retrieval costs and buyers provide stochastic feedback to posted prices. Three main challenges arise: (1) heterogeneous and partial feedback in configuration learning, (2) variable and complex feedback in pricing learning, and (3) inherent coupling between configuration and pricing decisions.
  We propose a hierarchical bandit framework that jointly optimizes retrieval configurations and pricing. Stage I employs contextual clustering with confidence-based exploration to learn effective configurations with logarithmic regret. Stage II adopts interval-based price selection with local Taylor approximation to estimate buyer responses and achieve sublinear regret. We establish theoretical guarantees with polynomial time complexity and validate the framework on four real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in cumulative reward and regret reduction compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.

Abstract: Deep learning-based video surveillance increasingly demands privacy-preserving architectures with low computational and environmental overhead. Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification. Our results inform hybrid deployment strategies that default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning.

Abstract: In many areas of systems biology, including virology, pharmacokinetics, and population biology, dynamical systems are commonly used to describe biological processes. These systems can be characterized by estimating their parameters from sampled data. The key problem is how to optimally select sampling points to achieve accurate parameter estimation. Classical approaches often rely on Fisher information matrix-based criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimality, which require an initial parameter estimate and may yield suboptimal results when the estimate is inaccurate. This study proposes two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling design that do not depend on initial parameter estimates. The first method, E-optimal-ranking (EOR), employs the E-optimal criterion, while the second utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Simulation studies based on the Lotka-Volterra and three-compartment models demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform both random selection and classical E-optimal design.

<title>Breaking the Stealth-Potency Trade-off in Clean-Image Backdoors with Generative Trigger Optimization</title>

Abstract: Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in automated industrial inspection, aiming to identify subtle or rare defects in otherwise uniform visual patterns. As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection.

Abstract: We give the first fully polynomial-time algorithm for learning halfspaces with respect to the uniform distribution on the hypercube in the presence of contamination, where an adversary may corrupt some fraction of examples and labels arbitrarily. We achieve an error guarantee of $\eta^{O(1)}+\epsilon$ where $\eta$ is the noise rate. Such a result was not known even in the agnostic setting, where only labels can be adversarially corrupted. All prior work over the last two decades has a superpolynomial dependence in $1/\epsilon$ or succeeds only with respect to continuous marginals (such as log-concave densities).
  Previous analyses rely heavily on various structural properties of continuous distributions such as anti-concentration. Our approach avoids these requirements and makes use of a new algorithm for learning Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with only a polylogarithmic dependence on the activation function's Lipschitz constant. More generally, our framework shows that supervised learning with respect to discrete distributions is not as difficult as previously thought.

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).

Abstract: Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.

Abstract: We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.

Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a smart way to manage municipal solid waste by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision (CV) to monitor illegal waste dumping at garbage vulnerable points (GVPs) in urban areas. The system can quickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object detection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in Telangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using the proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various object detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures waste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends, ensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard spectral methods based on Fourier transforms struggle with problems involving discontinuous coefficients due to the Gibbs phenomenon and poor representation of sharp interfaces. We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models. This demonstrates that Walsh-Hadamard and Fourier representations capture complementary aspects of discontinuous PDE solutions, with WHNO excelling at sharp interfaces while FNO captures smooth features effectively.

Abstract: Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted resilience perspective in the 6G network energy saving (NES) scenario. More specifically, we consider multiple ground base stations (GBSs) and each GBS has three different sectors/cells in the terrestrial networks, and multiple cells are turned off due to NES or incidents, e.g., disasters, hardware failures, or outages. To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under a sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure the resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of UAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power outages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently achieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming other baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy consumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\% compared to the conventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user service rate. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving a superior trade-off between energy efficiency and service performance, supporting the development of sustainable and resilient UAV-assisted cellular networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in depth-recurrent language models show that recurrence can decouple train-time compute and parameter count from test-time compute. In this work, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models into depth-recurrent models. We find that using a curriculum of recurrences to increase the effective depth of the model over the course of training preserves performance while reducing total computational cost. In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a sequential minimax optimization (SMO) method for solving a class of constrained bilevel optimization problems in which the lower-level part is a possibly nonsmooth convex optimization problem, while the upper-level part is a possibly nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, SMO applies a first-order method to solve a sequence of minimax subproblems, which are obtained by employing a hybrid of modified augmented Lagrangian and penalty schemes on the bilevel optimization problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish an operation complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-7}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-6}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of fundamental operations, for SMO in finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the bilevel optimization problems with merely convex and strongly convex lower-level objective functions, respectively. The latter result improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-1}$. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate significantly superior computational performance compared to the recently developed first-order penalty method.

Abstract: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

<title>Language Generation with Infinite Contamination</title>

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, where an algorithm observes an adversarial enumeration of strings from an unknown target language $K$ and must eventually generate new, unseen strings from $K$. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.
  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).
  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.
  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a combined network structure between convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) quantifier for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization. In contrast to conventional methods that utilize only spatial data with classification models, our CNN-LSTM network extracts both space and time features of the received channel state information (CSI) from a single router. Furthermore, the proposed network builds a quantification model rather than a limited classification model as in most of the literature work, which enables the estimation of testing points that are not identical to the reference points. We analyze the instability of CSI and demonstrate a mitigation solution using a comprehensive filter and normalization scheme. The localization accuracy is investigated through extensive on-site experiments with several mobile devices including mobile phone (Nexus 5) and laptop (Intel 5300 NIC) on hundreds of testing locations. Using only a single WiFi router, our structure achieves an average localization error of 2.5~m with $\mathrm{80\%}$ of the errors under 4~m, which outperforms the other reported algorithms by approximately $\mathrm{50\%}$ under the same test environment.

Abstract: We consider the revenue maximization problem for an online retailer who plans to display in order a set of products differing in their prices and qualities. Consumers have attention spans, i.e., the maximum number of products they are willing to view, and inspect the products sequentially before purchasing a product or leaving the platform empty-handed when the attention span gets exhausted. Our framework extends the well-known cascade model in two directions: the consumers have random attention spans instead of fixed ones, and the firm maximizes revenues instead of clicking probabilities. We show a nested structure of the optimal product ranking as a function of the attention span when the attention span is fixed. \sg{Using this fact, we develop an approximation algorithm when only the distribution of the attention spans is given. Under mild conditions, it achieves $1/e$ of the revenue of the clairvoyant case when the realized attention span is known. We also show that no algorithms can achieve more than 0.5 of the revenue of the same benchmark. The model and the algorithm can be generalized to the ranking problem when consumers make multiple purchases.} When the conditional purchase probabilities are not known and may depend on consumer and product features, we devise an online learning algorithm that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret relative to the approximation algorithm, despite the censoring of information: the attention span of a customer who purchases an item is not observable. Numerical experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the approximation and online learning algorithms.

Abstract: To advance the transparency of learning machines such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the field of Explainable AI (XAI) was established to provide interpretations of DNNs' predictions. While different explanation techniques exist, a popular approach is given in the form of attribution maps, which illustrate, given a particular data point, the relevant patterns the model has used for making its prediction. Although Bayesian models such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have a limited form of transparency built-in through their prior weight distribution, they lack explanations of their predictions for given instances. In this work, we take a step toward combining these two perspectives by examining how local attributions can be extended to BNNs. Within the Bayesian framework, network weights follow a probability distribution; hence, the standard point explanation extends naturally to an explanation distribution. Viewing explanations probabilistically, we aggregate and analyze multiple local attributions drawn from an approximate posterior to explore variability in explanation patterns. The diversity of explanations offers a way to further explore how predictive rationales may vary across posterior samples. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on toy and benchmark data, as well as on a real-world pathology dataset, illustrate that our framework enriches standard explanations with uncertainty information and may support the visualization of explanation stability.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the degree of group fairness changes when the degree of individual fairness is actively controlled. As a metric quantifying individual fairness, we consider generalized entropy (GE) recently introduced into machine learning community. To control the degree of individual fairness, we design a classification algorithm satisfying a given degree of individual fairness through an empirical risk minimization (ERM) with a fairness constraint specified in terms of GE. We show the PAC learnability of the fair ERM problem by proving that the true fairness degree does not deviate much from an empirical one with high probability for finite VC dimension if the sample size is big enough. Our experiments show that strengthening individual fairness degree does not always lead to enhancement of group fairness.

Abstract: Corruption is notoriously widespread in data collection. Despite extensive research, the existing literature predominantly focuses on specific settings and learning scenarios, lacking a unified view of corruption modelization and mitigation. In this work, we develop a general theory of corruption, which incorporates all modifications to a supervised learning problem, including changes in model class and loss. Focusing on changes to the underlying probability distributions via Markov kernels, our approach leads to three novel opportunities. First, it enables the construction of a novel, provably exhaustive corruption framework, distinguishing among different corruption types. This serves to unify existing models and establish a consistent nomenclature. Second, it facilitates a systematic analysis of corruption's consequences on learning tasks, by comparing Bayes risks in the clean and corrupted scenarios. Notably, while label corruptions affect only the loss function, attribute corruptions additionally influence the hypothesis class. Third, building upon these results, we investigate mitigations for various corruption types. We expand existing loss-correction methods for label corruption to handle dependent corruption types. Our findings highlight the necessity to generalize the classical corruption-corrected learning framework to a new paradigm with weaker requirements to encompass more corruption types. We provide such a paradigm as well as loss correction formulas in the attribute and joint corruption cases.

Abstract: Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in neural architecture search (NAS), enabling gradient-based methods to explore cell-based architectural spaces significantly faster than traditional black-box approaches. In parallel, weight-entanglement has emerged as a technique for more intricate parameter sharing amongst macro-architectural spaces. Since weight-entanglement is not directly compatible with gradient-based NAS methods, these two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods, while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces. The code for our work is openly accessible https://github.com/automl/TangleNAS.

Abstract: Constructing the architecture of a neural network is a challenging pursuit for the machine learning community, and the dilemma of whether to go deeper or wider remains a persistent question. This paper explores a comparison between deeper neural networks (DeNNs) with a flexible number of layers and wider neural networks (WeNNs) with limited hidden layers, focusing on their optimal generalization error in Sobolev losses. Analytical investigations reveal that the architecture of a neural network can be significantly influenced by various factors, including the number of sample points, parameters within the neural networks, and the regularity of the loss function. Specifically, a higher number of parameters tends to favor WeNNs, while an increased number of sample points and greater regularity in the loss function lean towards the adoption of DeNNs. We ultimately apply this theory to address partial differential equations using deep Ritz and physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods, guiding the design of neural networks.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a remarkably effective way of learning and sampling from a distribution $p(x)$. In posterior sampling, one is also given a measurement model $p(y \mid x)$ and a measurement $y$, and would like to sample from $p(x \mid y)$. Posterior sampling is useful for tasks such as inpainting, super-resolution, and MRI reconstruction, so a number of recent works have given algorithms to heuristically approximate it; but none are known to converge to the correct distribution in polynomial time.
  In this paper we show that posterior sampling is computationally intractable: under the most basic assumption in cryptography -- that one-way functions exist -- there are instances for which every algorithm takes superpolynomial time, even though unconditional sampling is provably fast. We also show that the exponential-time rejection sampling algorithm is essentially optimal under the stronger plausible assumption that there are one-way functions that take exponential time to invert.

<title>Optimization without Retraction on the Random Generalized Stiefel Manifold</title>

Abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices $X$ that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$, referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving sampled covariance matrices such as the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving these problems is typically done by iterative methods that require a fully formed $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization problem while having access only to random estimates of $B$. Our method does not enforce the constraint in every iteration; instead, it produces iterations that converge to critical points on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation. The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian optimization counterparts that require the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including CCA, ICA, and the GEVP.

Abstract: Learned optimizers (LOs) have the potential to significantly reduce the wall-clock training time of neural networks. However, they can struggle to optimize unseen tasks (\emph{meta-generalize}), especially when training networks wider than those seen during meta-training. To address this, we derive the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) for two state-of-the-art learned optimizer architectures and propose a simple meta-training recipe for $\mu$-parameterized LOs ($\mu$LOs). Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LOs meta-trained with our recipe substantially improve meta-generalization to wider unseen tasks when compared to LOs trained under standard parametrization (SP) using the same compute budget. We also empirically observe that $\mu$LOs exhibit unexpectedly improved meta-generalization to deeper networks ($5\times$ meta-training) and surprising generalization to much longer training horizons ($25\times$ meta-training) when compared to SP LOs.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) is an emerging technique designed to learn a significantly smaller graph that retains the essential information of the original graph. This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs. Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications like neural architecture search and deepens our understanding of redundancies in large graphs. Despite the rapid development of GC methods, particularly for node classification, a unified evaluation framework is still lacking to systematically compare different GC methods or clarify key design choices for improving their effectiveness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{GC4NC}, a comprehensive framework for evaluating diverse GC methods on node classification across multiple dimensions including performance, efficiency, privacy preservation, denoising ability, NAS effectiveness, and transferability. Our systematic evaluation offers novel insights into how condensed graphs behave and the critical design choices that drive their success. These findings pave the way for future advancements in GC methods, enhancing both performance and expanding their real-world applications.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of machine learning such as recommendations, hiring, and lending, deployed models influence the data they are trained on, leading to feedback loops between predictions and data distribution. The performative prediction (PP) framework captures this phenomenon by modeling the data distribution as a function of the deployed model. While prior work has focused on finding performative stable (PS) solutions for robustness, their societal impacts, particularly regarding fairness, remain underexplored. We show that PS solutions can lead to severe polarization and prediction performance disparities, and that conventional fairness interventions in previous works often fail under model-dependent distribution shifts due to failing the PS criteria. To address these challenges in PP, we introduce novel fairness mechanisms that provably ensure both stability and fairness, validated by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), which enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn from human feedback. This is particularly valuable when defining a fine-grain reward function is not feasible. However, this approach is inefficient and impractical for promoting deep exploration in hard-exploration tasks with long horizons and sparse rewards. To tackle this issue, we introduce LOPE: \textbf{L}earning \textbf{O}nline with trajectory \textbf{P}reference guidanc\textbf{E}, an end-to-end preference-guided RL framework that enhances exploration efficiency in hard-exploration tasks. Our intuition is that LOPE directly adjusts the focus of online exploration by considering human feedback as guidance, thereby avoiding the need to learn a separate reward model from preferences. Specifically, LOPE includes a two-step sequential policy optimization technique consisting of trust-region-based policy improvement and preference guidance steps. We reformulate preference guidance as a trajectory-wise state marginal matching problem that minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy distance between the preferred trajectories and the learned policy. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to characterize the performance improvement bound and evaluate the effectiveness of the LOPE. When assessed in various challenging hard-exploration environments, LOPE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence rate and overall performance.The code used in this study is available at https://github.com/buaawgj/LOPE.

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving multi-task generalization to diverse agents and objectives presents significant challenges. Existing online MARL algorithms primarily focus on single-task performance, but their lack of multi-task generalization capabilities typically results in substantial computational waste and limited real-life applicability. Meanwhile, existing offline multi-task MARL approaches are heavily dependent on data quality, often resulting in poor performance on unseen tasks. In this paper, we introduce HyGen, a novel hybrid MARL framework, Hybrid Training for Enhanced Multi-Task Generalization, which integrates online and offline learning to ensure both multi-task generalization and training efficiency. Specifically, our framework extracts potential general skills from offline multi-task datasets. We then train policies to select the optimal skills under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm (CTDE). During this stage, we utilize a replay buffer that integrates both offline data and online interactions. We empirically demonstrate that our framework effectively extracts and refines general skills, yielding impressive generalization to unseen tasks. Comparative analyses on the StarCraft multi-agent challenge show that HyGen outperforms a wide range of existing solely online and offline methods.

<title>Condensed Data Expansion Using Model Inversion for Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Condensed datasets offer a compact representation of larger datasets, but training models directly on them or using them to enhance model performance through knowledge distillation (KD) can result in suboptimal outcomes due to limited information. To address this, we propose a method that expands condensed datasets using model inversion, a technique for generating synthetic data based on the impressions of a pre-trained model on its training data. This approach is particularly well-suited for KD scenarios, as the teacher model is already pre-trained and retains knowledge of the original training data. By creating synthetic data that complements the condensed samples, we enrich the training set and better approximate the underlying data distribution, leading to improvements in student model accuracy during knowledge distillation. Our method demonstrates significant gains in KD accuracy compared to using condensed datasets alone and outperforms standard model inversion-based KD methods by up to 11.4% across various datasets and model architectures. Importantly, it remains effective even when using as few as one condensed sample per class, and can also enhance performance in few-shot scenarios where only limited real data samples are available.

Abstract: Most existing time-to-event methods focus on either single-event or competing-risks settings, leaving multi-event scenarios relatively underexplored. In many healthcare applications, for example, a patient may experience multiple clinical events, that can be non-exclusive and semi-competing. A common workaround is to train independent single-event models for such multi-event problems, but this approach fails to exploit dependencies and shared structures across events. To overcome these limitations, we propose MENSA (Multi-Event Network for Survival Analysis), a deep learning model that jointly learns flexible time-to-event distributions for multiple events, whether competing or co-occurring. In addition, we introduce a novel trajectory-based likelihood term that captures the temporal ordering between events. Across four multi-event datasets, MENSA improves predictive performance over many state-of-the-art baselines. Source code is available at https://github.com/thecml/mensa.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used to generate reward signals for training embodied agents to follow instructions, our research reveals that agents guided by VLM rewards often underperform compared to those employing only intrinsic (exploration-driven) rewards, contradicting expectations set by recent work. We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied agents

<title>FedMAC: Tackling Partial-Modality Missing in Federated Learning with Cross-Modal Aggregation and Contrastive Regularization</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a method for training machine learning models using distributed data sources. It ensures privacy by allowing clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while storing their data locally. However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with missing modalities in clients' datasets, where certain features or modalities are unavailable or incomplete, leading to heterogeneous data distribution. While previous studies have addressed the issue of complete-modality missing, they fail to tackle partial-modality missing on account of severe heterogeneity among clients at an instance level, where the pattern of missing data can vary significantly from one sample to another. To tackle this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework named FedMAC, designed to address multi-modality missing under conditions of partial-modality missing in FL. Additionally, to avoid trivial aggregation of multi-modal features, we introduce contrastive-based regularization to impose additional constraints on the latent representation space. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedMAC across various client configurations with statistical heterogeneity, outperforming baseline methods by up to 26% in severe missing scenarios, highlighting its potential as a solution for the challenge of partially missing modalities in federated systems.

Abstract: The post-training of LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning stage (RLHF or DPO), is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, this is suboptimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. This sequential paradigm persists largely due to its simplicity and modularity, which make it easier to implement and manage at scale despite its limitations. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training and propose a practical joint post-training framework which has theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, with up to 23% overall performance improvement across multiple LLM evaluation benchmarks, while having minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: We present a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning and algorithmic code synthesis tasks. The benchmark comprises integer sequence generation tasks sourced from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), testing LLMs' abilities to accurately and efficiently generate Python code to compute these sequences without using lookup tables. Our comprehensive evaluation includes leading models from OpenAI (including the specialized reasoning-focused o-series), Anthropic, Meta, and Google across a carefully selected set of 1000 OEIS sequences categorized as ``easy'' or ``hard.'' Half of these sequences are classical sequences from the early days of OEIS and half were recently added to avoid contamination with the models' training data. To prevent models from exploiting memorized sequence values, we introduce an automated cheating detection mechanism that flags usage of lookup tables, validated by comparison with human expert evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that reasoning-specialized models (o3, o3-mini, o4-mini from OpenAI, and Gemini 2.5-pro from Google) achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over non-reasoning models, especially on more complex tasks. However, overall model performance on the hard sequences is poor, highlighting persistent challenges in algorithmic reasoning. Our benchmark provides important insights into the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly emphasizing the necessity for further advancements to reliably solve complex mathematical reasoning tasks algorithmically.

Abstract: Network pruning focuses on algorithms that aim to reduce a given model's computational cost by removing a subset of its parameters while having minimal impact on performance. Throughout the last decade, the most widely used pruning paradigm has been pruning and re-training, which nowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which are, in any case, too expensive to re-train. In this paper, we exploit functional information from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their input activations, to obtain sparse models that maximize the activations' alignment with respect to their corresponding dense models. Hence, we propose \textbf{NeuroAl}, a \emph{top-up} algorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, which modifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity, exploiting information from both the dense model and its sparse version to maximize the \emph{neuron alignment} among activations. Different from existing methods, our approach adaptively selects the best hyperparameters for the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. the model and the desired sparsity, and requires \emph{no re-training}. We test our method over $\sim$300 test cases with four LLM families, three sparsity ratios, and ten language tasks (three language modeling and seven zero-shot datasets), showing how it consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance-runtime trade-off.

Abstract: The holy grail of machine learning is to enable Continual Federated Learning (CFL) to enhance the efficiency, privacy, and scalability of AI systems while learning from streaming data. The primary challenge of a CFL system is to overcome global catastrophic forgetting, wherein the accuracy of the global model trained on new tasks declines on the old tasks. In this work, we propose Continual Federated Learning with Aggregated Gradients (C-FLAG), a novel replay-memory based federated strategy consisting of edge-based gradient updates on memory and aggregated gradients on the current data. We provide convergence analysis of the C-FLAG approach which addresses forgetting and bias while converging at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ communication rounds. We formulate an optimization sub-problem that minimizes catastrophic forgetting, translating CFL into an iterative algorithm with adaptive learning rates that ensure seamless learning across tasks. We empirically show that C-FLAG outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on both task and class-incremental settings with respect to metrics such as accuracy and forgetting.

Abstract: Neural networks can learn spurious correlations in the data, often leading to performance degradation for underrepresented subgroups. Studies have demonstrated that the disparity is amplified when knowledge is distilled from a complex teacher model to a relatively ``simple'' student model. Prior work has shown that ensemble deep learning methods can improve the performance of the worst-case subgroups; however, it is unclear if this advantage carries over when distilling knowledge from an ensemble of teachers, especially when the teacher models are debiased. This study demonstrates that traditional ensemble knowledge distillation can significantly drop the performance of the worst-case subgroups in the distilled student model even when the teacher models are debiased. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group Robust Ensemble Knowledge Distillation (AGRE-KD), a simple ensembling strategy to ensure that the student model receives knowledge beneficial for unknown underrepresented subgroups. Leveraging an additional biased model, our method selectively chooses teachers whose knowledge would better improve the worst-performing subgroups by upweighting the teachers with gradient directions deviating from the biased model. Our experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ensemble distillation technique and show that it can even outperform classic model ensembles based on majority voting.

Abstract: Due largely to challenges associated with physical interpretability of machine learning (ML) methods, and because model interpretability is key to credibility in management applications, many scientists and practitioners are hesitant to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) modeling approaches despite their poorer predictive performance. Here, we examine how to develop parsimonious minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. The term minimally-optimal indicates that the desired outcome can be achieved with the smallest possible effort and resources, while parsimony is widely held to support understanding. Accordingly, we suggest that ML-based modeling should use computational units that are inherently physically-interpretable, and explore how generic network architectures comprised of Mass-Conserving-Perceptron can be used to model dynamical systems in a physically-interpretable manner.
  In the context of spatially-lumped catchment-scale modeling, we find that both physical interpretability and good predictive performance can be achieved using a distributed-state network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across nodes. The distributed-state mechanism ensures a sufficient number of temporally-evolving properties of system storage while information-sharing ensures proper synchronization of such properties. The results indicate that MCP-based ML models with only a few layers (up to two) and relativity few physical flow pathways (up to three) can play a significant role in ML-based streamflow modelling.

Abstract: Tabular data generation has attracted significant research interest in recent years, with the tabular diffusion models greatly improving the quality of synthetic data. However, while memorization, where models inadvertently replicate exact or near-identical training data, has been thoroughly investigated in image and text generation, its effects on tabular data remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of memorization phenomena in diffusion models for tabular data. Our empirical analysis reveals that memorization appears in tabular diffusion models and increases with larger training epochs. We further examine the influence of factors such as dataset sizes, feature dimensions, and different diffusion models on memorization. Additionally, we provide a theoretical explanation for why memorization occurs in tabular diffusion models. To address this issue, we propose TabCutMix, a simple yet effective data augmentation technique that exchanges randomly selected feature segments between random same-class training sample pairs. Building upon this, we introduce TabCutMixPlus, an enhanced method that clusters features based on feature correlations and ensures that features within the same cluster are exchanged together during augmentation. This clustering mechanism mitigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generation issues by maintaining feature coherence. Experimental results across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that TabCutMix effectively mitigates memorization while maintaining high-quality data generation.

We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.

Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous data and providing personalized solutions for non-IID scenarios. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) approaches aim to address these issues by balancing generalization and personalization, often through parameter decoupling or partial models that freeze some neural network layers for personalization while aggregating other layers globally. However, existing methods still face challenges of global-local model discrepancy, client drift, and catastrophic forgetting, which degrade model accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\textit{pMixFed}$, a dynamic, layer-wise PFL approach that integrates $\textit{mixup}$ between shared global and personalized local models. Our method introduces an adaptive strategy for partitioning between personalized and shared layers, a gradual transition of personalization degree to enhance local client adaptation, improved generalization across clients, and a novel aggregation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pMixFed outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods, showing faster model training, increased robustness, and improved handling of data heterogeneity under different heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly rely on explicit refusal prefixes for safety, making them vulnerable to prefix injection attacks. We introduce HumorReject, a novel data-driven approach that reimagines LLM safety by decoupling it from refusal prefixes through humor as an indirect refusal strategy. Rather than explicitly rejecting harmful instructions, HumorReject responds with contextually appropriate humor that naturally defuses potentially dangerous requests. Our approach effectively addresses common "over-defense" issues while demonstrating superior robustness against various attack vectors. Our findings suggest that improvements in training data design can be as important as the alignment algorithm itself in achieving effective LLM safety.

Abstract: Language models, while capable of generating remarkably coherent and seemingly accurate text, can occasionally produce undesirable content, including harmful or toxic outputs. In this paper, we present a new two-stage approach to detect and mitigate undesirable content generations by rectifying activations. First, we train an ensemble of layerwise classifiers to detect undesirable content using activations by minimizing a smooth surrogate of the risk-aware score. Then, for detected undesirable contents, we propose layerwise distributional steering policies that transform the attention heads. These policies are computed through principled semidefinite programming, which aims to minimally perturb the attention distribution while probabilistically guaranteeing the effectiveness of the editions. Empirical evaluations across multiple language models and datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in reducing the generation of undesirable output.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a crucial step in achieving strong predictive performance. Yet, the impact of individual hyperparameters on model generalization is highly context-dependent, prohibiting a one-size-fits-all solution and requiring opaque HPO methods to find optimal configurations. However, the black-box nature of most HPO methods undermines user trust and discourages adoption. To address this, we propose a game-theoretic explainability framework for HPO based on Shapley values and interactions. Our approach provides an additive decomposition of a performance measure across hyperparameters, enabling local and global explanations of hyperparameters' contributions and their interactions. The framework, named HyperSHAP, offers insights into ablation studies, the tunability of learning algorithms, and optimizer behavior across different hyperparameter spaces. We demonstrate HyperSHAP's capabilities on various HPO benchmarks to analyze the interaction structure of the corresponding HPO problems, demonstrating its broad applicability and actionable insights for improving HPO.

Abstract: The adoption of Foundation Models in resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to their large size and inference costs. A promising way to overcome these limitations is post-training compression, which aims to balance reduced model size against performance degradation. This work presents Any Compression via Iterative Pruning (ACIP), a novel algorithmic approach to determine a compression-performance trade-off from a single stochastic gradient descent run. To achieve parameter efficiency, we use an SVD-reparametrization of linear layers and iteratively prune their singular values with a sparsity-inducing penalty. Importantly, the pruning order of the parameters is used to derive a global score map that allows compressing a model to any target size without re-computation. We evaluate ACIP on a large selection of open-weight LLMs and downstream tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results compared to existing factorization-based compression methods. We also show that ACIP seamlessly complements common quantization-based compression techniques.

Abstract: Since its original formulation, Jensen's inequality has played a fundamental role across mathematics, statistics, and machine learning, with its probabilistic version highlighting the nonnegativity of the so-called Jensen's gap, i.e., the difference between the expectation of a convex function and the function at the expectation. Of particular importance is the case when the function is logarithmic, as this setting underpins many applications in variational inference, where the term variational gap is often used interchangeably. Recent research has focused on estimating the size of Jensen's gap and establishing tight lower and upper bounds under various assumptions on the underlying function and distribution, driven by practical challenges such as the intractability of log-likelihood in graphical models like variational autoencoders (VAEs). In this paper, we propose new, general bounds for Jensen's gap that accommodate a broad range of assumptions on both the function and the random variable, with special attention to exponential and logarithmic cases. We provide both analytical and empirical evidence for the performance of our method. Furthermore, we relate our bounds to the PAC-Bayes framework, providing new insights into generalization performance in probabilistic models.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though originally designed for generative tasks, have demonstrated impressive self-supervised representation learning capabilities. A particularly intriguing phenomenon in these models is the emergence of unimodal representation dynamics, where the quality of learned features peaks at an intermediate noise level. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigation of this phenomenon. Leveraging the inherent low-dimensionality structure of image data, we theoretically demonstrate that the unimodal dynamic emerges when the diffusion model successfully captures the underlying data distribution. The unimodality arises from an interplay between denoising strength and class confidence across noise scales. Empirically, we further show that, in classification tasks, the presence of unimodal dynamics reliably reflects the generalization of the diffusion model: it emerges when the model generates novel images and gradually transitions to a monotonically decreasing curve as the model begins to memorize the training data.

Abstract: Traditional solar forecasting models are based on several years of site-specific historical irradiance data, often spanning five or more years, which are unavailable for newer photovoltaic farms. As renewable energy is highly intermittent, building accurate solar irradiance forecasting systems is essential for efficient grid management and enabling the ongoing proliferation of solar energy, which is crucial to achieve the United Nations' net zero goals. In this work, we propose SPIRIT, a novel approach leveraging foundation models for solar irradiance forecasting, making it applicable to newer solar installations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot transfer learning by about 70%, enabling effective performance at new locations without relying on any historical data. Further improvements in performance are achieved through fine-tuning, as more location-specific data becomes available. These findings are supported by statistical significance, further validating our approach. SPIRIT represents a pivotal step towards rapid, scalable, and adaptable solar forecasting solutions, advancing the integration of renewable energy into global power systems.

Abstract: The server-less nature of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) requires allocating the aggregation role to specific participants in each federated round. Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.

Abstract: Making consistently profitable financial decisions in a continuously evolving and volatile stock market has always been a difficult task. Professionals from different disciplines have developed foundational theories to anticipate price movement and evaluate securities such as the famed Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In recent years, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in asset pricing has been growing. Although the black-box nature of deep learning models lacks interpretability, they have continued to solidify their position in the financial industry. We aim to further enhance AI's potential and utility by introducing a return-weighted loss function that will drive top growth while providing the ML models a limited amount of information. Using only publicly accessible stock data (open/close/high/low, trading volume, sector information) and several technical indicators constructed from them, we propose an efficient daily trading system that detects top growth opportunities. Our best models achieve 61.73\% annual return on daily rebalancing with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 1.18 over 1340 testing days from 2019 to 2024, and 37.61\% annual return with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.97 over 1360 testing days from 2005 to 2010. The main drivers for success, especially independent of any domain knowledge, are the novel return-weighted loss function, the integration of categorical and continuous data, and the ML model architecture. We also demonstrate the superiority of our novel loss function over traditional loss functions via several performance metrics and statistical evidence.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong Generalization (Burns et al., 2024) is the phenomenon whereby a strong student, say GPT-4, learns a task from a weak teacher, say GPT-2, and ends up significantly outperforming the teacher. We show that this phenomenon does not require a strong learner like GPT-4. We consider student and teacher that are random feature models, described by two-layer networks with a random and fixed bottom layer and a trained top layer. A "weak" teacher, with a small number of units (i.e. random features), is trained on the population, and a "strong" student, with a much larger number of units (i.e. random features), is trained only on labels generated by the weak teacher. We demonstrate, prove, and understand how the student can outperform the teacher, even though trained only on data labeled by the teacher. We also explain how such weak-to-strong generalization is enabled by early stopping. Importantly, we also show the quantitative limits of weak-to-strong generalization in this model.

<title>Continual Pre-training of MoEs: How robust is your router?</title>

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are promising architectures for foundation models. Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay, learning rate re-warming, and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale study training a 500M parameter dense transformer and four 500M-active/2B-total parameter MoE transformers. Each model is trained for 600B tokens. Our results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for MoEs using both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, we show that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost.

Abstract: This paper presents the Min-Cut Bayesian Network Consensus (MCBNC) algorithm, a greedy method for structural consensus of Bayesian Networks (BNs), with applications in federated learning and model aggregation. MCBNC prunes weak edges from an initial unrestricted fusion using a structural score based on min-cut analysis, integrated into a modified Backward Equivalence Search (BES) phase of the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm. The score quantifies edge support across input networks and is computed using max-flow. Unlike methods with fixed treewidth bounds, MCBNC introduces a pruning threshold $\theta$ that can be selected post hoc using only structural information. Experiments on real-world BNs show that MCBNC yields sparser, more accurate consensus structures than both canonical fusion and the input networks. The method is scalable, data-agnostic, and well-suited for distributed or federated scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced memory-bound characteristics during inference due to High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) bandwidth constraints. In this paper, we propose an L2 Cache-oriented asynchronous KV Cache prefetching method to break through the memory bandwidth bottleneck in LLM inference through computation-load overlap. By strategically scheduling idle memory bandwidth during active computation windows, our method proactively prefetches required KV Cache into GPU L2 cache, enabling high-speed L2 cache hits for subsequent accesses and effectively hiding HBM access latency within computational cycles. Extensive experiments on NVIDIA H20 GPUs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 2.15x improvement in attention kernel efficiency and up to 1.97x end-to-end throughput enhancement, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline FlashAttention-3. Notably, our solution maintains orthogonality to existing optimization techniques and can be integrated with current inference frameworks, providing a scalable latency-hiding solution for next-generation LLM inference engines.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: At the core of the Transformer, the softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often de-stabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard ViT and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. Our QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.

Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field (MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode. Recent work has shown that untrained DNNs exhibit an initial-guessing bias (IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single class. In this work, we provide a theoretical proof linking IGB to MF analyses, establishing that a network predisposition toward specific classes is intrinsically tied to the conditions for efficient learning. This connection leads to a counterintuitive conclusion: the initialization that optimizes trainability is systematically biased rather than neutral. We validate our theory through experiments across multiple architectures and datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for differentially private (DP) statistical estimation via data truncation, addressing a key challenge in DP estimation when the data support is unbounded. Traditional approaches rely on problem-specific sensitivity analysis, limiting their applicability. By leveraging techniques from truncated statistics, we develop computationally efficient DP estimators for exponential family distributions, including Gaussian mean and covariance estimation, achieving near-optimal sample complexity. Previous works on exponential families only consider bounded or one-dimensional families. Our approach mitigates sensitivity through truncation while carefully correcting for the introduced bias using maximum likelihood estimation and DP stochastic gradient descent. Along the way, we establish improved uniform convergence guarantees for the log-likelihood function of exponential families, which may be of independent interest. Our results provide a general blueprint for DP algorithm design via truncated statistics.

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics of single cells from snapshot data has gained increasing attention in scientific and machine learning research. The destructive measurement technique and cell proliferation/death result in unpaired and unbalanced data between snapshots, making the learning of the underlying dynamics challenging. In this paper, we propose joint Velocity-Growth Flow Matching (VGFM), a novel paradigm that jointly learns state transition and mass growth of single-cell populations via flow matching. VGFM builds an ideal single-cell dynamics containing velocity of state and growth of mass, driven by a presented two-period dynamic understanding of the static semi-relaxed optimal transport, a mathematical tool that seeks the coupling between unpaired and unbalanced data. To enable practical usage, we approximate the ideal dynamics using neural networks, forming our joint velocity and growth matching framework. A distribution fitting loss is also employed in VGFM to further improve the fitting performance for snapshot data. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that VGFM can capture the underlying biological dynamics accounting for mass and state variations over time, outperforming existing approaches for single-cell dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work explores how test-time compute (TTC) can serve as an energy-efficient complement to conventional scaling strategies by allocating additional computational resources at inference time rather than during training. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models.

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in practice, getting trapped in early-discovered modes and requiring prolonged training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques often rely on heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is \textbf{directly driven by the main GFlowNet's training loss}. By prioritizing trajectories where the main model exhibits \textbf{high loss}, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across \textbf{diverse benchmarks} including grid environments, structured sequence generation, Bayesian structure learning, and biological sequence design, LGGFN consistently \textbf{outperforms} baselines in exploration efficiency and sample diversity. For instance, on a challenging sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately 99\%.

Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) learning algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function with well-designed negative samples for contrastive learning. Existing goodness functions are typically defined as the sum of squared postsynaptic activations, neglecting correlated variability between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for noisy copies of individual inputs while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples.We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared output, which is equivalent to making predictions based on an energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

<title>On the Relation between Rectified Flows and Optimal Transport</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the connections between rectified flows, flow matching, and optimal transport. Flow matching is a recent approach to learning generative models by estimating velocity fields that guide transformations from a source to a target distribution. Rectified flow matching aims to straighten the learned transport paths, yielding more direct flows between distributions. Our first contribution is a set of invariance properties of rectified flows and explicit velocity fields. In addition, we also provide explicit constructions and analysis in the Gaussian (not necessarily independent) and Gaussian mixture settings and study the relation to optimal transport. Our second contribution addresses recent claims suggesting that rectified flows, when constrained such that the learned velocity field is a gradient, can yield (asymptotically) solutions to optimal transport problems. We study the existence of solutions for this problem and demonstrate that they only relate to optimal transport under assumptions that are significantly stronger than those previously acknowledged. In particular, we present several counterexamples that invalidate earlier equivalence results in the literature, and we argue that enforcing a gradient constraint on rectified flows is, in general, not a reliable method for computing optimal transport maps.

Abstract: Applying Transformers to irregular time-series typically requires specializations to their baseline architecture, which can result in additional computational overhead and increased method complexity. We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables interpolation and representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.

<title>Graph Flow Matching: Enhancing Image Generation with Neighbor-Aware Flow Fields</title>

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

<title>From Invariant Representations to Invariant Data: Provable Robustness to Spurious Correlations via Noisy Counterfactual Matching</title>

Abstract: Models that learn spurious correlations from training data often fail when deployed in new environments. While many methods aim to learn invariant representations to address this, they often underperform standard empirical risk minimization (ERM). We propose a data-centric alternative that shifts the focus from learning invariant representations to leveraging invariant data pairs -- pairs of samples that should have the same prediction. We prove that certain counterfactuals naturally satisfy this invariance property. Based on this, we introduce Noisy Counterfactual Matching (NCM), a simple constraint-based method that improves robustness by leveraging even a small number of \emph{noisy} counterfactual pairs -- improving upon prior works that do not explicitly consider noise. For linear causal models, we prove that NCM's test-domain error is bounded by its in-domain error plus a term dependent on the counterfactuals' quality and diversity. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theory, and we demonstrate NCM's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms, generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing, standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in medicine.

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences, (2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research practices across machine learning applications.

Abstract: Dynamic causal discovery in wireless networks is essential due to evolving interference, fading, and mobility, which complicate traditional static causal models. This paper addresses causal inference challenges in dynamic fading wireless environments by proposing a sequential regression-based algorithm with a novel application of the NOTEARS acyclicity constraint, enabling efficient online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under nonstationary wireless conditions.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-chain-of-thought reasoning models via scaling reinforcement learning (RL), its underlying training dynamics remain poorly understood, and several counterintuitive behaviors persist. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in scaling RL, revealing that positive samples mainly facilitate precise fitting to the training data, whereas negative samples significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, while positive samples are essential for convergence in the zero-RL setting, training on negative samples alone suffices to attain strong reasoning performance and even better generalization in cold-start scenarios. (2) We identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization, where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we explore two strategies, including relative length rewards and offline sample injection, to leverage these data better and enhance reasoning efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that greedy decoding can distort evaluation by flipping the correctness of responses.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade, with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However, recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months -- remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at https://github.com/Belilovsky-Lab/pylo

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting, but this progress is still met with skepticism about whether LLMs are truly useful for this task. To address this, we propose Time-Prompt, a framework for activating LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, we first construct a unified prompt paradigm with learnable soft prompts to guide the LLM's behavior and textualized hard prompts to enhance the time series representations. Second, to enhance LLM' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve fusion of temporal and textual data. Finally, we efficiently fine-tune the LLM's parameters using time series data. Furthermore, we focus on carbon emissions, aiming to provide a modest contribution to global carbon neutrality. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that Time-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.

Abstract: When an LLM learns a new fact during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases, newly elected pope, etc.), where does this information go? Are entities enriched with relation information, or do models recall information just-in-time before a prediction? Or, are ``all of the above'' true with LLMs implementing multiple redundant heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g., activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they usually \textit{replace} parts of the residual stream, thus overriding previous information. To fill this gap, we propose \emph{dynamic weight grafting}, a technique that selectively grafts weights from a finetuned model onto a pretrained model. Using this technique, we show two separate pathways for retrieving finetuned relation information: 1) ``enriching" the residual stream with relation information while processing the tokens that correspond to an entity (e.g., ``Zendaya'' in ``Zendaya co-starred with John David Washington'') and 2) ``recalling" this information at the final token position before generating a target fact. In some cases, models need information from both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned facts while, in other cases, either the ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway alone is sufficient. We localize the ``recall'' pathway to model components -- finding that ``recall" occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and an entity-specific extraction step in the feedforward networks of the final layers before the target prediction. By targeting model components and parameters, as opposed to just activations, we are able to understand the \textit{mechanisms} by which finetuned knowledge is retrieved during generation.

Abstract: The physical sciences are replete with dynamical systems that require the resolution of a wide range of length and time scales. This presents significant computational challenges since direct numerical simulation requires discretization at the finest relevant scales, leading to a high-dimensional state space. In this work, we propose an approach to learn stochastic multiscale models in the form of stochastic differential equations directly from observational data. Drawing inspiration from physics-based multiscale modeling approaches, we resolve the macroscale state on a coarse mesh while introducing a microscale latent state to explicitly model unresolved dynamics. We learn the parameters of the multiscale model using a simulator-free amortized variational inference method with a Product of Experts likelihood that enforces scale separation. We present detailed numerical studies to demonstrate that our learned multiscale models achieve superior predictive accuracy compared to under-resolved direct numerical simulation and closure-type models at equivalent resolution, as well as reduced-order modeling approaches.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: The task of reconstructing unknown textual inputs to language models is a fundamental auditing primitive that allows us to assess the model's vulnerability to a range of security issues, including stealing hidden system prompts, detecting backdoors, and leaking private data. Existing inversion works assume access to differing levels of information (e.g. requiring input-output examples, the model parameters, intermediate activations or output logits) but oftentimes fail to fully reconstruct the desired input. In this paper, we present the Sparse One-hot Discrete Adam (SODA) algorithm, a search-based inversion method that can accurately reconstruct the input text, given white-box access to the language model and its output. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that exact language model inversion is possible on both natural language and random inputs. Indeed, SODA achieves respectively 98% and 79% reconstruction rates on inputs with lengths up to 10 tokens. Furthermore, we show that input length and vocabulary size have a far greater impact on the probability of a successful reconstruction than the size of the language model itself, thus allowing us to scale to models from 33M to 3B parameters.

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and empirically verify the predicted effects.

Abstract: Large Language Models frequently generate outputs that appear scientifically reasonable yet violate fundamental principles--a phenomenon we characterize as the "plausibility-validity gap." This challenge proves especially acute in chemistry, where superficial correctness masks deeper errors in molecular structure, reaction mechanisms, and synthetic pathways. We present a systematic approach combining a reasoning-centric model architecture (Magistral Small) with Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dual-domain dataset covering molecular properties and chemical transformations. Evaluation reveals substantial improvements: the fine-tuned system achieves 96.3% format adherence, 97.4% chemical validity, and 74.4% synthesis feasibility. Comparative analysis shows our approach outperforms specialized translation models like MolT5 (97.4% vs 77.2% validity) while achieving performance comparable to complex tool-augmented systems like ChemCrow (9.0/10 vs 9.24/10 expert rating) through a more transparent, efficient methodology. Results demonstrate a learning hierarchy where syntactic correctness develops before chemical understanding, which precedes synthetic planning capability. This work establishes a reproducible framework for transforming generalist language models into dependable scientific tools while identifying critical areas including stereochemical precision, knowledge currency, and computational accessibility as key challenges for future advancement.

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data. While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution. Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution shift types, and TTA methods.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) seeks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when models are trained with sequential tasks. A common approach, experience replay (ER), stores past exemplars but only sparsely approximates the data distribution, yielding fragile and oversimplified decision boundaries. We address this limitation by introducing synthetic boundary data (SBD), generated via differential privacy: inspired noise into latent features to create boundary-adjacent representations that implicitly regularize decision boundaries. Building on this idea, we propose Experience Blending (EB), a framework that jointly trains on exemplars and SBD through a dual-model aggregation strategy. EB has two components: (1) latent-space noise injection to synthesize boundary data, and (2) end-to-end training that jointly leverages exemplars and SBD. Unlike standard experience replay, SBD enriches the feature space near decision boundaries, leading to more stable and robust continual learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate consistent accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively, over strong baselines.

Abstract: Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that end-to-end training in linear computational complexity can achieve the resulting bound-aware objective. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes. The code and proofs are in https://github.com/ChoiYoonHyuk/SGPC.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained GPT-2 Small models, examining these universal neurons-neurons with consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at five checkpoints, we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions, measured via cross entropy loss. Additionally, we quantify neuron persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training checkpoints, particularly in early and deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and universal representational structures emerge during language model training.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model. However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First, we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally, PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that \sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble learning methods.

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban planning, transportation optimization, and personalized services. However, the inherent randomness, non-uniform time intervals, and complex patterns of human mobility, compounded by the heterogeneity introduced by varying city structures, infrastructure, and population densities, present significant challenges in modeling. Existing solutions often require training separate models for each city due to distinct spatial representations and geographic coverage. In this paper, we propose UniMove, a unified model for multi-city human mobility prediction, addressing two challenges: (1) constructing universal spatial representations for effective token sharing across cities, and (2) modeling heterogeneous mobility patterns from varying city characteristics. We propose a trajectory-location dual-tower architecture, with a location tower for universal spatial encoding and a trajectory tower for sequential mobility modeling. We also design MoE Transformer blocks to adaptively select experts to handle diverse movement patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets from diverse cities demonstrate that UniMove truly embodies the essence of a unified model. By enabling joint training on multi-city data with mutual data enhancement, it significantly improves mobility prediction accuracy by over 10.2\%. UniMove represents a key advancement toward realizing a true foundational model with a unified architecture for human mobility. We release the implementation at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniMove/.

Abstract: Modern methods of generative modelling and unpaired data translation based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control theory aim to transform an initial density to a target one in an optimal way. In the present paper, we assume that we only have access to i.i.d. samples from initial and final distributions. This makes our setup suitable for both generative modelling and unpaired data translation. Relying on the stochastic optimal control approach, we choose an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as the reference one and estimate the corresponding Schr\"odinger potential. Introducing a risk function as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between couplings, we derive tight bounds on generalization ability of an empirical risk minimizer in a class of Schr\"odinger potentials including Gaussian mixtures. Thanks to the mixing properties of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we almost achieve fast rates of convergence up to some logarithmic factors in favourable scenarios. We also illustrate performance of the suggested approach with numerical experiments.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the accuracy of weather predictions by discovering spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states. Existing numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations. However, the shifting locations of observations and the surrounding meteorological context induce complex, dynamic spatial correlations that are difficult for traditional NWP systems to capture, since they rely on strict statistical and physical formulations. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ a spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method (CloudNine-v2) using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia, achieving up to 15\% reductions in RMSE over existing STGNN models. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, CloudNine-v2 consistently outperformed baselines with and without structure learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten. Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5 unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis, establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM development.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural $\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we introduce the Curiosity models, a family of decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing 115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the largest scaling-law study of medical event data, establishing a methodology for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute, tokens, and model size. Consequently, we pretrained a series of compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a patient's real-world history, Curiosity autoregressively predicts the next medical event to simulate patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks, including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations. Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based inference, Curiosity generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot examples. Curiosity's predictive power consistently improves as the model and pretraining scale. Our results show that Curiosity, a generative medical event foundation model, can effectively capture complex clinical dynamics, providing an extensible and generalizable framework to support clinical decision-making, streamline healthcare operations, and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes, thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML) problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning (FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory, which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence.Theoretical analysis shows that FAML enhances fairness in the evidence learning process. Extensive experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache. Recent work has proposed Cartridges, an approach which leverages offline compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned Cartridge key-value cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) Cartridge keys act as stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of the learned compression occurs within the Cartridge value vectors. We present empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned Cartridge key vectors between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We suggest that SCI can lead to faster Cartridge convergence than previously demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader empirical study of Cartridge training optimization which may be crucial for further scaling.

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments, partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude: momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while remaining competitive on low-noise tasks.

Abstract: This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision-language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised "product recategorization" pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (for example, subtypes of "Shoes") with cluster purities above 86%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU-accelerated multimodal stage to balance cost and accuracy.

Abstract: The development of self-supervised graph pre-training methods is a crucial ingredient in recent efforts to design robust graph foundation models (GFMs). Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%, outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient quantifies, for each observation, the balance between within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation, taking values in [-1, 1]. The average silhouette width (ASW) is a widely used internal measure of clustering quality, with higher values indicating more cohesive and well-separated clusters. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and the standard upper limit of 1 is rarely attainable. In this work, we derive for each data point a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width and aggregate these to obtain a canonical upper bound on the ASW. This bound-often substantially below 1-enhances the interpretability of empirical ASW values by indicating how close a given clustering result is to the best possible outcome on that dataset. It can be used to confirm global optimality, guide the evaluation of clustering solutions, and be refined to incorporate minimum cluster-size constraints for greater practical relevance. Finally, we extend the framework to establish a corresponding bound for the macro-averaged silhouette.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for scientific discovery in chemistry, yet its efficiency is often hampered by the sparse experimental data and vast search space. Here, we introduce ChemBOMAS: a large language model (LLM)-enhanced multi-agent system that accelerates BO through synergistic data- and knowledge-driven strategies. Firstly, the data-driven strategy involves an 8B-scale LLM regressor fine-tuned on a mere 1% labeled samples for pseudo-data generation, robustly initializing the optimization process. Secondly, the knowledge-driven strategy employs a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach to guide LLM in dividing the search space while mitigating LLM hallucinations. An Upper Confidence Bound algorithm then identifies high-potential subspaces within this established partition. Across the LLM-refined subspaces and supported by LLM-generated data, BO achieves the improvement of effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple scientific benchmarks demonstrate that ChemBOMAS set a new state-of-the-art, accelerating optimization efficiency by up to 5-fold compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, but it also introduces significant challenges to student data privacy. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited for approximating solutions to partial differential equations. Despite their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to various PDEs. To address this limitation, we introduce Fourier-Embedded trunk networks within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random fourier feature mappings to enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-Embedded DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the two-dimensional Poisson, Burgers', Lorenz-63, Eikonal, Allen-Cahn, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. FEDONet delivers consistently superior reconstruction accuracy across all benchmark PDEs, with particularly large relative $L^2$ error reductions observed in chaotic and stiff systems. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a significant gap remains between its practical performance and theoretical understanding. Existing analyses show that the Muon variants achieve only a suboptimal iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we analyze two Momentum-based Variance-Reduced variants: a one-batch version (Muon-MVR1) and a two-batch version (Muon-MVR2). We provide the first rigorous proof that incorporating variance reduction enables Muon-MVR2 to attain the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Furthermore, our analysis establishes last-iterate convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision (CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work offers the first proof of optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

<title>TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding</title>

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).

<title>Private Online Learning against an Adaptive Adversary: Realizable and Agnostic Settings</title>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021] established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$ against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online learnable in the agnostic setting.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Abstract: For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains, regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships. We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato, rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by 16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer) is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues, reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting, underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37 datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network architectures and training stability.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g., image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there is still an accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances loss minimization with the quantization constraints, yielding a principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient implementation that leverages Adam statistics. CAGE significantly improves upon the prior state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, for similar computational cost: for QAT fine-tuning, it halves the compression accuracy loss relative to the prior best method, while for QAT pre-training of Llama models, its accuracy for 3-bit weights-and-activations (W3A3) matches the accuracy achieved at 4-bits (W4A4) with the prior best method. The official implementation can be found over https://github.com/IST-DASLab/CAGE .

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However, most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR) objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption, connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over a baseline policy with high probability.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios, we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component "skills'' at training and test.

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy. The code is available in https://github.com/junkangLiu0/FedAdamW.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate reasoning method for a given query remains a key challenge in language model generation. Existing approaches typically generate multiple candidate responses and use an aggregation strategy to select the output answer, often assuming that more candidate answers yield higher accuracy. We revisit this assumption through a rigorous theoretical analysis, deriving accuracy bounds for standard aggregation methods under fixed generation distributions and candidate sizes. Building on these insights, we introduce EPIC, an Ensemble Planning with Contrastive learning framework to learn a shared representation space that captures both model reasoning abilities and query-method compatibility. EPIC incorporates our probability bounds as a regularizer in a utility-driven optimization that balances accuracy and computational cost. Experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning tasks show that EPIC consistently selects optimal reasoning methods, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Sensitivity analysis is a cornerstone of climate science, essential for understanding phenomena ranging from storm intensity to long-term climate feedbacks. However, computing these sensitivities using traditional physical models is often prohibitively expensive in terms of both computation and development time. While modern AI-based generative models are orders of magnitude faster to evaluate, computing sensitivities with them remains a significant bottleneck. This work addresses this challenge by applying the adjoint state method for calculating gradients in generative flow models. We apply this method to the cBottle generative model, trained on ERA5 and ICON data, to perform sensitivity analysis of any atmospheric variable with respect to sea surface temperatures. We quantitatively validate the computed sensitivities against the model's own outputs. Our results provide initial evidence that this approach can produce reliable gradients, reducing the computational cost of sensitivity analysis from weeks on a supercomputer with a physical model to hours on a GPU, thereby simplifying a critical workflow in climate science.

Abstract: Erasing harmful or proprietary concepts from powerful text to image generators is an emerging safety requirement, yet current "concept erasure" techniques either collapse image quality, rely on brittle adversarial losses, or demand prohibitive retraining cycles. We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that EraseFlow outperforms existing baselines and achieves an optimal trade off between performance and prior preservation.

<title>Priors in Time: Missing Inductive Biases for Language Model Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Recovering meaningful concepts from language model activations is a central aim of interpretability. While existing feature extraction methods aim to identify concepts that are independent directions, it is unclear if this assumption can capture the rich temporal structure of language. Specifically, via a Bayesian lens, we demonstrate that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) impose priors that assume independence of concepts across time, implying stationarity. Meanwhile, language model representations exhibit rich temporal dynamics, including systematic growth in conceptual dimensionality, context-dependent correlations, and pronounced non-stationarity, in direct conflict with the priors of SAEs. Taking inspiration from computational neuroscience, we introduce a new interpretability objective -- Temporal Feature Analysis -- which possesses a temporal inductive bias to decompose representations at a given time into two parts: a predictable component, which can be inferred from the context, and a residual component, which captures novel information unexplained by the context. Temporal Feature Analyzers correctly parse garden path sentences, identify event boundaries, and more broadly delineate abstract, slow-moving information from novel, fast-moving information, while existing SAEs show significant pitfalls in all the above tasks. Overall, our results underscore the need for inductive biases that match the data in designing robust interpretability tools.

Abstract: We present a methodology for using unlabeled data to design semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that improve the predictive performance of supervised learning for regression tasks. The main idea is to design different mechanisms for integrating the unlabeled data, and include in each of them a mixing parameter $\alpha$, controlling the weight given to the unlabeled data. Focusing on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and linear interpolators classes of models, we analyze the characteristics of different mixing mechanisms, and prove that it is consistently beneficial to integrate the unlabeled data with some nonzero mixing ratio $\alpha>0$, in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, we provide a rigorous framework to estimate the best mixing ratio where mixed-SSL delivers the best predictive performance, while using the labeled and unlabeled data on hand. The effectiveness of our methodology in delivering substantial improvement compared to the standard supervised models, in a variety of settings, is demonstrated empirically through extensive simulation, providing empirical support for our theoretical analysis. We also demonstrate the applicability of our methodology (with some heuristic modifications) to improve more complex models, such as deep neural networks, in real-world regression tasks

<title>Last-Iterate Convergence of Adaptive Riemannian Gradient Descent for Equilibrium Computation</title>

Abstract: Equilibrium computation on Riemannian manifolds provides a unifying framework for numerous problems in machine learning and data analytics. One of the simplest yet most fundamental methods is Riemannian gradient descent (RGD). While its Euclidean counterpart has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how the manifold curvature affects RGD in game-theoretic settings. This paper addresses this gap by establishing new convergence results for \textit{geodesic strongly monotone} games. Our key result shows that RGD attains last-iterate linear convergence in a \textit{geometry-agnostic} fashion, a key property for applications in machine learning. We extend this guarantee to stochastic and adaptive variants -- SRGD and FARGD -- and establish that: (i) the sample complexity of SRGD is geometry-agnostic and optimal with respect to noise; (ii) FARGD matches the convergence rate of its non-adaptive counterpart up to constant factors, while avoiding reliance on the condition number. Overall, this paper presents the first geometry-agnostic last-iterate convergence analysis for games beyond the Euclidean settings, underscoring the surprising power of RGD -- despite its simplicity -- in solving a wide spectrum of machine learning problems.

Abstract: Accurately estimating treatment effects over time is crucial in fields such as precision medicine, epidemiology, economics, and marketing. Many current methods for estimating treatment effects over time assume that all confounders are observed or attempt to infer unobserved ones. In contrast, our approach focuses on unobserved adjustment variables, which specifically have a causal effect on the outcome sequence. Under the assumption of unconfoundedness, we address estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in response to treatment due to these unobserved adjustment variables. Our proposed Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) is grounded in theoretical guarantees concerning the validity of latent adjustment variables and generalization bounds on CATE estimation error. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that CDVAE outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models significantly improve their CATE estimates when augmented with the latent substitutes learned by CDVAE, approaching oracle-level performance without direct access to the true adjustment variables.

Abstract: We propose a novel GPU-cluster scheduler for distributed DL (DDL) workloads that enables proximity based consolidation of GPU resources based on the DDL jobs' sensitivities to the anticipated communication-network delays. Our scheduler consists of three major components: (i) a classical delay scheduling algorithm to facilitate job placement and consolidation; (ii) a network-sensitive job preemption strategy; and (iii) an "auto-tuner" mechanism to optimize delay timers for effective delay scheduling. Additionally, to enable a cost-effective methodology for large-scale experiments, we develop a data-driven DDL cluster simulation platform. Employing the simulation platform we compare against several state-of-the-art alternatives on real-world workload traces to demonstrate the benefits of our design. Our scheduler can provide improvement of up to 69% in end-to-end Makespan for training all jobs compared to the prevailing consolidation-based scheduling methods, while reducing the average job completion time by up to 83% and minimizing the communication overheads by up to 98% under congested networking conditions.

Abstract: This work aims to improve the sample efficiency of parallel large-scale ranking and selection (R&amp;S) problems by leveraging correlation information. We modify the commonly used "divide and conquer" framework in parallel computing by adding a correlation-based clustering step, transforming it into "clustering and conquer". Analytical results under a symmetric benchmark scenario show that this seemingly simple modification yields an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ reduction in sample complexity for a widely used class of sample-optimal R&amp;S procedures. Our approach enjoys two key advantages: 1) it does not require highly accurate correlation estimation or precise clustering, and 2) it allows for seamless integration with various existing R&amp;S procedures, while achieving optimal sample complexity. Theoretically, we develop a novel gradient analysis framework to analyze sample efficiency and guide the design of large-scale R&amp;S procedures. We also introduce a new parallel clustering algorithm tailored for large-scale scenarios. Finally, in large-scale AI applications such as neural architecture search, our methods demonstrate superior performance.

Abstract: Next-generation Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled next-generation MIMO networks. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO networks from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.

Abstract: Contextual linear optimization (CLO) uses predictive contextual features to reduce uncertainty in random cost coefficients in the objective and thereby improve decision-making performance. A canonical example is the stochastic shortest path problem with random edge costs (e.g., travel time) and contextual features (e.g., lagged traffic, weather). While existing work on CLO assumes fully observed cost coefficient vectors, in many applications the decision maker observes only partial feedback corresponding to each chosen decision in the history. In this paper, we study both a bandit-feedback setting (e.g., only the overall travel time of each historical path is observed) and a semi-bandit-feedback setting (e.g., travel times of the individual segments on each chosen path are additionally observed). We propose a unified class of offline learning algorithms for CLO with different types of feedback, following a powerful induced empirical risk minimization (IERM) framework that integrates estimation and optimization. We provide a novel fast-rate regret bound for IERM that allows for misspecified model classes and flexible choices of estimation methods. To solve the partial-feedback IERM, we also tailor computationally tractable surrogate losses. A byproduct of our theory of independent interest is the fast-rate regret bound for IERM with full feedback and a misspecified policy class. We compare the performance of different methods numerically using stochastic shortest path examples on simulated and real data and provide practical insights from the empirical results.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions. Our code and data are at https://github.com/roberto-ceraolo/quriosity.

Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in the effect of different types of adversarial perturbations in data classification problems. Many of these models incorporate the adversarial power, which is an important parameter with an associated trade-off between accuracy and robustness. This work considers a general framework for adversarially-perturbed classification problems, in a large data or population-level limit. In such a regime, we demonstrate that as adversarial strength goes to zero that optimal classifiers converge to the Bayes classifier in the Hausdorff distance. This significantly strengthens previous results, which generally focus on $L^1$-type convergence. The main argument relies upon direct geometric comparisons and is inspired by techniques from geometric measure theory.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) through developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has brought significant advancements across various technological domains. While these models enhance capabilities in natural language processing and visual interactive tasks, their growing adoption raises critical concerns regarding security and ethical alignment. This survey provides an extensive review of the emerging field of jailbreaking--deliberately circumventing the ethical and operational boundaries of LLMs and VLMs--and the consequent development of defense mechanisms. Our study categorizes jailbreaks into seven distinct types and elaborates on defense strategies that address these vulnerabilities. Through this comprehensive examination, we identify research gaps and propose directions for future studies to enhance the security frameworks of LLMs and VLMs. Our findings underscore the necessity for a unified perspective that integrates both jailbreak strategies and defensive solutions to foster a robust, secure, and reliable environment for the next generation of language models.

Abstract: Tabular data is considered the last unconquered castle of deep learning, yet the task of data stream classification is stated to be an equally important and demanding research area. Due to the temporal constraints, it is assumed that deep learning methods are not the optimal solution for application in this field. However, excluding the entire -- and prevalent -- group of methods seems rather rash given the progress that has been made in recent years in its development. For this reason, the following paper is the first to present an approach to natural language data stream classification using the sentence space method, which allows for encoding text into the form of a discrete digital signal. This allows the use of convolutional deep networks dedicated to image classification to solve the task of recognizing fake news based on text data. Based on the real-life Fakeddit dataset, the proposed approach was compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for data stream classification based on generalization ability and time complexity.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often struggle in real-world environments, where ambient noise severely degrades their performance. This paper explores a novel approach that exploits prior knowledge of testing environments to maximize SER performance under noisy conditions. To address this task, we propose a text-guided, environment-aware training where an SER model is trained with contaminated speech samples and their paired noise description. We use a pre-trained text encoder to extract the text-based environment embedding and then fuse it to a transformer-based SER model during training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through our experiment with the MSP-Podcast corpus and real-world additive noise samples collected from the Freesound and DEMAND repositories. Our experiment indicates that the text-based environment descriptions processed by a large language model (LLM) produce representations that improve the noise-robustness of the SER system. With a contrastive learning (CL)-based representation, our proposed method can be improved by jointly fine-tuning the text encoder with the emotion recognition model. Under the -5dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level, fine-tuning the text encoder improves our CL-based representation method by 76.4% (arousal), 100.0% (dominance), and 27.7% (valence).

Abstract: With recent advancements in next-generation data storage, especially in biological molecule-based storage, insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in realistic DNA-based storage channels.

We derive a novel bound on the number of samples that are required to construct a probably approximately correct (PAC) estimate of the target. Furthermore, when the moving target is a convex polytope, we provide a constructive method of generating the PAC estimate using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The proposed method is demonstrated on an application to autonomous emergency braking.

arXiv:2409.19791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prevalent belief among optimization specialists is that linear convergence of gradient descent is contingent on the function growing quadratically away from its minimizers. In this work, we argue that this belief is inaccurate. We show that gradient descent with an adaptive stepsize converges at a local (nearly) linear rate on any smooth function that merely exhibits fourth-order growth away from its minimizer. The adaptive stepsize we propose arises from an intriguing decomposition theorem: any such function admits a smooth manifold around the optimal solution -- which we call the ravine -- so that the function grows at least quadratically away from the ravine and has constant order growth along it. The ravine allows one to interlace many short gradient steps with a single long Polyak gradient step, which together ensure rapid convergence to the minimizer. We illustrate the theory and algorithm on the problems of matrix sensing and factorization and learning a single neuron in the overparameterized regime.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success but is hindered by inefficiency and instability, relying on large amounts of trial-and-error data and failing to efficiently use past experiences to guide decisions. However, humans achieve remarkably efficient learning from experience, attributed to abstracting concepts and updating associated probabilistic beliefs by integrating both uncertainty and prior knowledge, as observed by cognitive science. Inspired by this, we introduce Conceptual Belief-Informed Reinforcement Learning to emulate human intelligence (HI-RL), an efficient experience utilization paradigm that can be directly integrated into existing RL frameworks. HI-RL forms concepts by extracting high-level categories of critical environmental information and then constructs adaptive concept-associated probabilistic beliefs as experience priors to guide value or policy updates. We evaluate HI-RL by integrating it into various existing value- and policy-based algorithms (DQN, PPO, SAC, and TD3) and demonstrate consistent improvements in sample efficiency and performance across both discrete and continuous control benchmarks.

Abstract: As text-to-image diffusion models gain widespread commercial applications, there are increasing concerns about unethical or harmful use, including the unauthorized generation of copyrighted or sensitive content. Concept unlearning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by removing undesired and harmful information from the pre-trained model. However, the previous evaluations primarily focus on whether target concepts are removed while preserving image quality, neglecting the broader impacts such as unintended side effects. In this work, we propose Holistic Unlearning Benchmark (HUB), a comprehensive framework for evaluating unlearning methods across six key dimensions: faithfulness, alignment, pinpoint-ness, multilingual robustness, attack robustness, and efficiency. Our benchmark covers 33 target concepts, including 16,000 prompts per concept, spanning four categories: Celebrity, Style, Intellectual Property, and NSFW. Our investigation reveals that no single method excels across all evaluation criteria. By releasing our evaluation code and dataset, we hope to inspire further research in this area, leading to more reliable and effective unlearning methods.

Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aims to discover objects in images or videos by reconstructing the input. Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability. The source code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/GroupedDiscreteRepresentation.

Abstract: Diffusion models can effectively generate high-quality images. However, as they scale, rising memory demands and higher latency pose substantial deployment challenges. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where existing post-training quantization methods like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing, which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights. Then, we use a high-precision, low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), while a low-bit quantized branch handles the residuals. This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, naively running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\times$, achieving 3.0$\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantization (W4A16) baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU with INT4 precision. On the latest RTX 5090 desktop with Blackwell architecture, we achieve a 3.1$\times$ speedup compared to the W4A16 model using NVFP4 precision.

Abstract: The proliferation of Machine Learning (ML) models and their open-source implementations has transformed Artificial Intelligence research and applications. Platforms like Hugging Face (HF) enable this evolving ecosystem, yet a large-scale longitudinal study of how these models change is lacking. This study addresses this gap by analyzing over 680,000 commits from 100,000 models and 2,251 releases from 202 of these models on HF using repository mining and longitudinal methods. We apply an extended ML change taxonomy to classify commits and use Bayesian networks to model temporal patterns in commit and release activities. Our findings show that commit activities align with established data science methodologies, such as the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), emphasizing iterative refinement. Release patterns tend to consolidate significant updates, particularly in model outputs, sharing, and documentation, distinguishing them from granular commits. Furthermore, projects with higher popularity exhibit distinct evolutionary paths, often starting from a more mature baseline with fewer foundational commits in their public history. In contrast, those with intensive collaboration show unique documentation and technical evolution patterns. These insights enhance the understanding of model changes on community platforms and provide valuable guidance for best practices in model maintenance.

<title>Sparsifying Suprema of Gaussian Processes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a dimension-independent sparsification result for suprema of centered Gaussian processes: Let $T$ be any (possibly infinite) bounded set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\{\boldsymbol{X}_t := t \cdot \boldsymbol{g} \}_{t\in T}$ be the canonical Gaussian process on $T$, where $\boldsymbol{g}\sim N(0, I_n)$. We show that there is an $O_\varepsilon(1)$-size subset $S \subseteq T$ and a set of real values $\{c_s\}_{s \in S}$ such that the random variable $\sup_{s \in S} \{{\boldsymbol{X}}_s + c_s\}$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximator\,(in $L^1$) of the random variable $\sup_{t \in T} {\boldsymbol{X}}_t$. Notably, the size of the sparsifier $S$ is completely independent of both $|T|$ and the ambient dimension $n$.
  We give two applications of this sparsification theorem:
  - A "Junta Theorem" for Norms: We show that given any norm $\nu(x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is another norm $\psi(x)$ depending only on the projection of $x$ onto $O_\varepsilon(1)$ directions, for which $\psi({\boldsymbol{g}})$ is a multiplicative $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of $\nu({\boldsymbol{g}})$ with probability $1-\varepsilon$ for ${\boldsymbol{g}} \sim N(0,I_n)$.
  - Sparsification of Convex Sets: We show that any intersection of (possibly infinitely many) halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are at distance $r$ from the origin is $\varepsilon$-close (under $N(0,I_n)$) to an intersection of only $O_{r,\varepsilon}(1)$ halfspaces. This yields new polynomial-time \emph{agnostic learning} and \emph{tolerant property testing} algorithms for intersections of halfspaces.

Abstract: Conic optimization plays a crucial role in many machine learning (ML) problems. However, practical algorithms for conic constrained ML problems with large datasets are often limited to specific use cases, as stochastic algorithms for general conic optimization remain underdeveloped. To fill this gap, we introduce a stochastic interior-point method (SIPM) framework for general conic optimization, along with four novel SIPM variants leveraging distinct stochastic gradient estimators. Under mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of our proposed SIPMs, which, up to a polylogarithmic factor, match the best-known {results} in stochastic unconstrained optimization. Finally, our numerical experiments on robust linear regression, multi-task relationship learning, and clustering data streams demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

<title>Mitigating Sexual Content Generation via Embedding Distortion in Text-conditioned Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2501.18877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models show remarkable image generation performance following text prompts, but risk generating sexual contents. Existing approaches, such as prompt filtering, concept removal, and even sexual contents mitigation methods, struggle to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining benign image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Distorting Embedding Space (DES), a text encoder-based defense mechanism that effectively tackles these issues through innovative embedding space control. DES transforms unsafe embeddings, extracted from a text encoder using unsafe prompts, toward carefully calculated safe embedding regions to prevent unsafe contents generation, while reproducing the original safe embeddings. DES also neutralizes the ``nudity'' embedding, by aligning it with neutral embedding to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. As a result, extensive experiments on explicit content mitigation and adaptive attack defense show that DES achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense, with attack success rate (ASR) of 9.47% on FLUX.1, a recent popular model, and 0.52% on the widely adopted Stable Diffusion v1.5. These correspond to ASR reductions of 76.5% and 63.9% compared to previous SOTA methods, EraseAnything and AdvUnlearn, respectively. Furthermore, DES maintains benign image quality, achieving Frechet Inception Distance and CLIP score comparable to those of the original FLUX.1 and Stable Diffusion v1.5.

Abstract: We provide a new online learning algorithm for tackling the Multinomial Logit Bandit (MNL-Bandit) problem. Despite the challenges posed by the combinatorial nature of the MNL model, we develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based method that achieves Approximate Pareto Optimality by balancing regret minimization and estimation error of the assortment revenues and the MNL parameters. We develop theoretical guarantees characterizing the tradeoff between regret and estimation error for the MNL-Bandit problem through information-theoretic bounds, and propose a modified UCB algorithm that incorporates forced exploration to improve parameter estimation accuracy while maintaining low regret. Our analysis sheds critical insights into how to optimally balance the collected revenues and the treatment estimation in dynamic assortment optimization.

Abstract: While neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, accurately quantifying uncertainty in their predictions is essential to ensure their trustworthiness and enable widespread adoption in critical systems. Several Bayesian uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods exist that are either cheap or reliable, but not both. We propose a post-hoc, sampling-based UQ method for over-parameterized networks at the end of training. Our approach constructs efficient and meaningful deep ensembles by employing a (stochastic) gradient-descent sampling process on appropriately linearized networks. We demonstrate that our method effectively approximates the posterior of a Gaussian process using the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that our method not only outperforms competing approaches in computational efficiency-often reducing costs by multiple factors-but also maintains state-of-the-art performance across a variety of UQ metrics for both regression and classification tasks.

arXiv:2502.05390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through example-based prompts without requiring parameter updates. However, understanding how tasks are internally encoded and generalized remains a challenge. To address some of the empirical and technical gaps in the literature, we introduce an automated formulation for encoding task information in ICL prompts as a function of attention heads within the transformer architecture. This approach computes a single task vector as a weighted sum of attention heads, with the weights optimized causally via gradient descent. Our findings show that existing methods fail to generalize effectively to modalities beyond text. In response, we also design a benchmark to evaluate whether a task vector can preserve task fidelity in functional regression tasks. The proposed method successfully extracts task-specific information from in-context demonstrations and excels in both text and regression tasks, demonstrating its generalizability across modalities.

<title>PCS: Perceived Confidence Scoring of Black Box LLMs with Metamorphic Relations</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot LLMs are now also used for textual classification tasks, e.g., sentiment and bias detection in a sentence or article. However, their performance can be suboptimal in such data annotation tasks. We introduce a novel technique that evaluates an LLM's confidence for classifying a textual input by leveraging Metamorphic Relations (MRs). The MRs generate semantically equivalent yet textually divergent versions of the input. Following the principles of Metamorphic Testing (MT), the mutated versions are expected to have annotation labels similar to the input. By analyzing the consistency of an LLM's responses across these variations, we compute a perceived confidence score (PCS) based on the frequency of the predicted labels. PCS can be used for both single and multiple LLM settings (e.g., when multiple LLMs are vetted in a majority-voting setup). Empirical evaluation shows that our PCS-based approach improves the performance of zero-shot LLMs by 9.3% in textual classification tasks. When multiple LLMs are used in a majority-voting setup, we obtain a performance boost of 5.8% with PCS.

arXiv:2502.09649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visuomotor imitation learning policies enable robots to efficiently acquire manipulation skills from visual demonstrations. However, as scene complexity and visual distractions increase, policies that perform well in simple settings often experience substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose ImitDiff, a diffusion-based imitation learning policy guided by fine-grained semantics within a dual-resolution workflow. Leveraging pretrained priors of vision-language foundation models, our method transforms high-level instructions into pixel-level visual semantic masks. These masks guide a dual-resolution perception pipeline that captures both global context (e.g., overall layout) from low-resolution observation and fine-grained local features (e.g., geometric details) from high-resolution observation, enabling the policy to focus on task-relevant regions. Additionally, we introduce a consistency-driven diffusion transformer action head that bridges visual semantic conditions and real-time action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitDiff outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language manipulation frameworks, as well as visuomotor imitation learning policies, particularly under increased scene complexity and visual distractions. Notably, ImitDiff exhibits strong generalization in zero-shot settings involving novel objects and visual distractions. Furthermore, our consistency-driven action head achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference speed while maintaining competitive success rates.

<title>PPC-GPT: Federated Task-Specific Compression of Large Language Models via Pruning and Chain-of-Thought Distillation</title>

arXiv:2502.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a novel unified framework that systematically addresses both privacy preservation and model compression in federated settings. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Our framework's key innovation lies in its holistic integration of privacy-preserving mechanisms, synthetic data generation, and task-specific compression techniques, creating unique benefits through component interaction. Our experiments across diverse text generation tasks demonstrate that PPC-GPT successfully achieves dual objectives: maintaining competitive performance comparable to full-sized LLMs while ensuring robust privacy protection through its federated architecture. Our code has been contributed to the FATE open-source project and is now publicly accessible at \textit{https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE-LLM/tree/main/python/fate_llm/algo/ppc-gpt}

arXiv:2502.19086v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt Gaussian Processes (GPs) as latent functions for probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.

arXiv:2503.04981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stream networks, a unique class of spatiotemporal graphs, exhibit complex directional flow constraints and evolving dependencies, making uncertainty quantification a critical yet challenging task. Traditional conformal prediction methods struggle in this setting due to the need for joint predictions across multiple interdependent locations and the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in stream networks. Existing approaches either neglect dependencies, leading to overly conservative predictions, or rely solely on data-driven estimations, failing to capture the rich topological structure of the network. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Conformal Inference (\texttt{STACI}), a novel framework that integrates network topology and temporal dynamics into the conformal prediction framework. \texttt{STACI} introduces a topology-aware nonconformity score that respects directional flow constraints and dynamically adjusts prediction sets to account for temporal distributional shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees on the validity of our approach and demonstrate its superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that \texttt{STACI} effectively balances prediction efficiency and coverage, outperforming existing conformal prediction methods for stream networks.

Abstract: Seismic inversion-including post-stack, pre-stack, and full waveform inversion is compute and memory-intensive. Recently, several approaches, including physics-informed machine learning, have been developed to address some of these limitations. Motivated by the potential of quantum computing, we report on our attempt to map one such classical physics-informed algorithm to a quantum framework. The primary goal is to investigate the technical challenges of this mapping, given that quantum algorithms rely on computing principles fundamentally different from those in classical computing. Quantum computers operate using qubits, which exploit superposition and entanglement, offering the potential to solve classically intractable problems. While current quantum hardware is limited, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms-particularly in quantum machine learning (QML)-demonstrate potential for near-term applications and can be readily simulated. We apply QML to subsurface imaging through the development of a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQ-PINN) for post-stack and pre-stack seismic inversion. The HQ-PINN architecture adopts an encoder-decoder structure: a hybrid quantum neural network encoder estimates P- and S-impedances from seismic data, while the decoder reconstructs seismic responses using geophysical relationships. Training is guided by minimizing the misfit between the input and reconstructed seismic traces. We systematically assess the impact of quantum layer design, differentiation strategies, and simulator backends on inversion performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through the inversion of both synthetic and the Sleipner field datasets. The HQ-PINN framework consistently yields accurate results, showcasing quantum computing's promise for geosciences and paving the way for future quantum-enhanced geophysical workflows.

Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. This paper provides a gentle introduction to this approach in bioinformatics, and is the first to review key applications in proteomics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), single-cell and multi-omics studies in their legal as well as methodological and infrastructural challenges. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have a similar impact in bioinformatics, allowing academic and clinical institutions to access many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks.

Abstract: To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), quantum or quantum convolutional neural networks (QNNs, QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (Hybrid NNs) by assessing their performance based on round-robin matches. Our results show that the Hybrid NNs engines achieve Elo ratings comparable to those of CCNNs engines, while the quantum engines underperform under current hardware constraints. Additionally, we implement a QNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels, and the communication overhead was found to be modest. These results demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.

<title>How Post-Training Reshapes LLMs: A Mechanistic View on Knowledge, Truthfulness, Refusal, and Confidence</title>

Abstract: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HZD01/post-training-mechanistic-analysis.

Abstract: Approximate Bayesian inference for models with computationally expensive, black-box likelihoods poses a significant challenge, especially when the posterior distribution is complex. Many inference methods struggle to explore the parameter space efficiently under a limited budget of likelihood evaluations. Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a sample-efficient method that addresses this by building a local surrogate model of the log-posterior. However, its conservative exploration strategy, while promoting stability, can cause it to miss important regions of the posterior, such as distinct modes or long tails. In this work, we introduce Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC), a method that overcomes this limitation by constructing a robust, global posterior approximation from multiple independent VBMC runs. Our approach merges these local approximations through a principled and inexpensive post-processing step that leverages VBMC's mixture posterior representation and per-component evidence estimates. Crucially, S-VBMC requires no additional likelihood evaluations and is naturally parallelisable, fitting seamlessly into existing inference workflows. We demonstrate its effectiveness on two synthetic problems designed to challenge VBMC's exploration and two real-world applications from computational neuroscience, showing substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality across all cases. Our code is available as a Python package at https://github.com/acerbilab/svbmc.

Abstract: Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks.

<title>Environment-Aware Indoor LoRaWAN Ranging Using Path Loss Model Inversion and Adaptive RSSI Filtering</title>

Abstract: Achieving sub-10 m indoor ranging with LoRaWAN is difficult because multipath, human blockage, and micro-climate dynamics induce non-stationary attenuation in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We present a lightweight, interpretable pipeline that couples an environment-aware multi-wall path loss model with a forward-only, innovation-driven Kalman prefilter for RSSI. The model augments distance and wall terms with frequency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and co-located environmental covariates (temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), and is inverted deterministically for distance estimation. On a one-year single-gateway office dataset comprising over 2 million uplinks, the approach attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.74 m and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.76 m in distance estimation, improving over a COST-231 multi-wall baseline (12.07 m MAE) and its environment-augmented variant (7.76 m MAE. Filtering reduces RSSI volatility from 10.33 to 5.43 dB and halves path loss error to 5.35 dB while raising R-squared from 0.82 to 0.89. The result is a single-anchor LoRaWAN ranging method with constant per-packet cost that is accurate, robust, and interpretable, providing a strong building block for multi-gateway localization.

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes. Code and videos are available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Sim/.

<title>Probabilistic Wind Power Modelling via Heteroscedastic Non-Stationary Gaussian Processes</title>

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic prediction of wind power is crucial for maintaining grid stability and facilitating the efficient integration of renewable energy sources. Gaussian process (GP) models offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty; however, conventional approaches typically rely on stationary kernels and homoscedastic noise assumptions, which are inadequate for modelling the inherently non-stationary and heteroscedastic nature of wind speed and power output. We propose a heteroscedastic non-stationary GP framework based on the generalised spectral mixture kernel, enabling the model to capture input-dependent correlations as well as input-dependent variability in wind speed-power data. We evaluate the proposed model on 10-minute supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements and compare it against GP variants with stationary and non-stationary kernels, as well as commonly used non-GP probabilistic baselines. The results highlight the necessity of modelling both non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity in wind power prediction and demonstrate the practical value of flexible non-stationary GP models in operational SCADA settings.

arXiv:2505.11343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to proving the convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms. The new approach is based on a concept called GSLLN (Generalized Strong Law of Large Numbers), which extends the traditional SLLN. Using this concept, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence, which effectively decouple the properties of the function whose zero we are trying to find, from the properties of the measurement errors (noise sequence). The new approach provides an alternative to the two widely used approaches, namely the ODE approach and the martingale approach, and also permits a wider class of noise signals than either of the two known approaches. In particular, the ``noise'' or measurement error \textit{need not} have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is computed using $2d$ function evaluations, but no gradient computations. The sufficient conditions derived here are the weakest to date, thus leading to a considerable expansion of the applicability of SA and SGD theory.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state. In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.

<title>From Average-Iterate to Last-Iterate Convergence in Games: A Reduction and Its Applications</title>

arXiv:2506.03464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of online learning algorithms in games under self-play is a fundamental question in game theory and machine learning. Among various notions of convergence, last-iterate convergence is particularly desirable, as it reflects the actual decisions made by the learners and captures the day-to-day behavior of the learning dynamics. While many algorithms are known to converge in the average-iterate, achieving last-iterate convergence typically requires considerably more effort in both the design and the analysis of the algorithm. Somewhat surprisingly, we show in this paper that for a large family of games, there exists a simple black-box reduction that transforms the average iterates of an uncoupled learning dynamics into the last iterates of a new uncoupled learning dynamics, thus also providing a reduction from last-iterate convergence to average-iterate convergence. Our reduction applies to games where each player's utility is linear in both their own strategy and the joint strategy of all opponents. This family includes two-player bimatrix games and generalizations such as multi-player polymatrix games. By applying our reduction to the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, we obtain new state-of-the-art last-iterate convergence rates for uncoupled learning dynamics in multi-player zero-sum polymatrix games: (1) an $O(\frac{\log d}{T})$ last-iterate convergence rate under gradient feedback, representing an exponential improvement in the dependence on the dimension $d$ (i.e., the maximum number of actions available to either player); and (2) an $\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{5}} T^{-\frac{1}{5}})$ last-iterate convergence rate under bandit feedback, improving upon the previous best rates of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{8}})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{6}})$.

Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However, recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy, we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, thus offering a scalable path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations suffer from low GPU utilization, significant latency overhead, and a fundamental inability to leverage task locality, primarily due to CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashMoE, a fully GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU communication into a single persistent GPU kernel. FlashMoE enables fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Unlike existing work, FlashMoE eliminates bulk-synchronous collectives for one-sided, device-initiated, inter-GPU (R)DMA transfers, thereby unlocking payload efficiency by eliminating bloated or redundant network payloads in sparsely activated layers. When evaluated on an 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models comprising up to 128 experts and 16K token sequences, FlashMoE achieves up to 9x higher GPU utilization, 6x lower latency, 5.7x higher throughput, and 4x better overlap efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using FP32, whereas the baselines use FP16. FlashMoE shows that principled GPU kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of large-scale distributed ML. We provide code at https://github.com/osayamenja/FlashMoE.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and lead to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. When combined with Reinforcement Learning techniques, they have the potential to enhance both system behavior and physical-layer security hardening. In addition to security improvements, it is crucial to consider the concept of fair communication. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces must ensure that User Equipment units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other units being deprived of ser- vice due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining both an efficient and fair duplex Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Reinforcement Learning system for multiple legitimate User Equipment units without reducing the level of achieved physical-layer security hardening. In terms of contributions, we uncover a fairness imbalance of a previous physical-layer security hardening solution, validate our findings and report experimental work via simulation results. We also provide an alternative reward strategy to solve the uncovered problems and release both code and datasets to foster further research in the topics of this paper.

<title>Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video Diffusion</title>

arXiv:2506.08009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

<title>Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows</title>

arXiv:2506.10153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in arbitrarily long gust sequences via pitch control. The random gusts produce intermittent, high-variance flows observed only through limited surface pressure sensors, making this control problem inherently challenging compared to stationary flows. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial observability from the limited surface pressures. We demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques -- pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord pitching.

Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model for precise diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning (ML) modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUROC of 1.00 and a testing AUROC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable ML model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.

Abstract: Despite progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the binding problem: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current LVLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces Visual Input Structure for Enhanced Reasoning (VISER), a simple, effective method that augments visual inputs with low-level spatial structures and pairs them with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks, using only a single-query inference. Specifically, VISER improves GPT-4o performance on visual search, counting, and spatial relationship tasks by 25.0%, 26.8%, and 9.5%, respectively, and reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32 on 2D datasets. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. VISER underscores the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically based reasoning strategies and suggests that visual structuring is a powerful and general approach for enhancing compositional and spatial reasoning in LVLMs.

Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) do not preserve privacy at inference-time. The LLM's outputs can inadvertently reveal information about the model's context, which presents a privacy challenge when the LLM is augmented via tools or databases containing sensitive information. Existing privacy-preserving methods at inference-time have significant limitations since they (i) lack provable guarantees or (ii) have a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism for LLMs that provably bounds the influence a set of tokens in the context can have on the LLM's output. DP-Fusion works as follows: (1) label a subset of sensitive tokens, (2) infer the LLM without any sensitive tokens to obtain a baseline, (3) infer the LLM with the sensitive tokens, and (4) blend distributions so that the final output remains within a bounded distance of the baseline distribution. While this per-token influence bound also mitigates jailbreak-style prompt injection, we focus on \emph{document privatization}, where the goal is to paraphrase a document containing sensitive tokens, e.g., personally identifiable information, so that no attacker can reliably infer them from the paraphrased document while preserving high text quality. The privacy/utility trade-off is controlled by $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0$ hides sensitive tokens entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved text quality. We show that our method creates token-level provably privatized documents with substantially improved theoretical and empirical privacy, achieving $6\times$ lower perplexity than related DPI methods.

Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Dataset-v3, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. Furthermore, we show our moderately multilingual fine-tuning enables robust cross-lingual transfer and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work advances multilingual LLM safety by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

<title>On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that avoids barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving trainability. We establish a necessary condition pertaining to the system's initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings provide a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that balance expressivity and trainability.

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

<title>ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning over extended context and its high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods could fall short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation, analogous to human cognition on reasoning with memory-related signals in the brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace. In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths, then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global context comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm towards retrieval-based stateful reasoning. Our framework is made publicly available at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG.

Abstract: Swarm based optimization algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems. However, their widespread adoption remains sceptical due to limited transparency in how different algorithmic components influence the overall performance of the algorithm. This work presents a multi-faceted interpretability related investigations of one of the popular swarm algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization. Through this work, we provide a framework that makes the role of different topologies and parameters in PSO interpretable and explainable using novel machine learning approach. We first developed a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features in the problem that affects the optimization performance of PSO. Secondly, we rigorously compare three topologies - Ring, Star, and Von Neumann analyzing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behavior, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO. The work successfully decodes how swarm topologies affect information flow, diversity, and convergence. Through systematic experimentation across 24 benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings uncover the black-box nature of PSO, providing more transparency and interpretability to swarm intelligence systems.

arXiv:2509.13624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications. This often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This implies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all tasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using datasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution requests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework, building a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect these cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify latent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic) and discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal that performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level dataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors of the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length proclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more influential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer learning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation.

<title>Multi-Scenario Highway Lane-Change Intention Prediction: A Physics-Informed AI Framework for Three-Class Classification</title>

arXiv:2509.17354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread. Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements, operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework for planning their LLM strategies.

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.

Abstract: Decentralized inference provides a scalable and resilient paradigm for serving large language models (LLMs), enabling distributed resource utilization and reducing reliance on centralized providers. However, in a permissionless environment without trusted nodes, ensuring the correctness of model outputs remains a core challenge. We introduce VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference that achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption while maintaining practical efficiency. VeriLLM combines lightweight empirical rerunning with cryptographic commitments, allowing verifiers to validate results at approximately 1% of the underlying inference cost. To prevent verification bottlenecks, we design an isomorphic inference-verification architecture that multiplexes both inference and verification roles across the same GPU workers. This design (i) improves GPU utilization and overall throughput, (ii) enlarges the effective validator set, enhancing robustness and liveness, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability to prevent node-specific optimizations or selective behavior. Through theoretical analysis and system-level evaluation, we show that VeriLLM achieves reliable public verifiability with minimal overhead, offering a practical foundation for trustworthy and scalable decentralized LLM inference.

Abstract: Preference-based data often appear complex and noisy but may conceal underlying homogeneous structures. This paper introduces a novel framework of ranking structure recognition for preference-based data. We first develop an approach to identify dynamic ranking groups by incorporating temporal penalties into a spectral estimation for the celebrated Bradley-Terry model. To detect structural changes, we introduce an innovative objective function and present a practicable algorithm based on dynamic programming. Theoretically, we establish the consistency of ranking group recognition by exploiting properties of a random `design matrix' induced by a reversible Markov chain. We also tailor a group inverse technique to quantify the uncertainty in item ability estimates. Additionally, we prove the consistency of structure change recognition, ensuring the robustness of the proposed framework. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility and interpretability of our approach.

arXiv:2510.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for large astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.

arXiv:2510.10534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The final published version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a standard way to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially. While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed top frequent subset of the target model's vocabulary. Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. Across standard speculative decoding benchmarks, DynaSpec delivers consistent improvements in mean accepted length, for Llama-3-8B, reaching upto 98.2% of full-vocabulary performance, while fixed-shortlist baselines attain only 84.4%. By leveraging context-dependent selection, DynaSpec achieves up to a 2.18 times increase in generated tokens compared to 1.91 times for fixed-vocabulary approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.

Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.

Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations. Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b) low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli matrices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling applications from content generation to decision support. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by incorporating external knowledge but also introduces security risks, particularly from data poisoning, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database to manipulate system outputs. While various defenses have been proposed, they often struggle against advanced attacks. To address this, we introduce RAGuard, a detection framework designed to identify poisoned texts. RAGuard first expands the retrieval scope to increase the proportion of clean texts, reducing the likelihood of retrieving poisoned content. It then applies chunk-wise perplexity filtering to detect abnormal variations and text similarity filtering to flag highly similar texts. This non-parametric approach enhances RAG security, and experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating poisoning attacks, including strong adaptive attacks.

<title>Model Inversion Attacks Meet Cryptographic Fuzzy Extractors</title>

Abstract: Model inversion attacks pose an open challenge to privacy-sensitive applications that use machine learning (ML) models. For example, face authentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from face images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks can accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no systematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against model inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face authentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of best-effort solutions.
  In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong defense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the cryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy extractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so through a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate of over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the first candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance comparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face authentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees, even in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and empirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face distributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any re-training of the ML model it protects. Empirically, it nullifies both prior state-of-the-art inversion attacks as well as our new PIPE attack.

<title>Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze. Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured, lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.25% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.29% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a mixture model learning approach to identify defects in laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. By incorporating physics based principles, we also ensure that the model is sensitive to meaningful physical parameter variations. The empirical evaluation was conducted by analyzing real-world data from two AM processes: Directed Energy Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion. In addition, we also studied the performance of the developed framework over public datasets with different alloy type and experimental parameter information. The results show the potential of physics-guided mixture models to examine the underlying physical behavior of an AM system.

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev\.minimum, Elev\.L3, lev\.MAD\.mode, Elev\.mode, Elev\.MAD\.median, and Elev\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.

Abstract: We introduce disciplined biconvex programming (DBCP), a modeling framework for specifying and solving biconvex optimization problems. Biconvex optimization problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a biconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods based on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one block of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting subproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and implementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually requires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and error-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to biconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in a natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem can then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for which a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users to quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without expertise in convex optimization. We implement DBCP into the open source Python package dbcp, as an extension to the famous domain specific language CVXPY for convex optimization.

<div> cache management, language models, key-value cache, positional encodings, eviction strategies
<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the impact of key-value (KV) cache management on the efficiency of large language models (LLMs), particularly in stateful multi-turn scenarios. The study shows that as the KV cache grows close to the model's context window limit, LLM generation quality deteriorates. Eviction strategies, even those with high retention rates, can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Preserving contiguous context blocks through simple strategies is found to yield more coherent outputs. The study emphasizes the importance of eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and consider "cache health" holistically beyond size. It highlights the need to maintain consistency in positional signals like RoPE to achieve optimal model performance. Overall, the paper underscores the significance of managing the KV cache effectively in enhancing the performance of LLMs in various scenarios.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Summary: 
Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is crucial for classifying brain disorders and constructing functional connectivity networks. Current models overlook the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations, leading to limitations in diagnostic sensitivities. A novel framework is proposed utilizing Adaptive Cascade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture intra- and cross-band interactions in a unified functional network. This unified network informs a message-passing mechanism within the Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on ADNI and ABIDE datasets show superior performance over existing methods. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

The Coherent Gated Fusion Block integrates frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation, achieving accurate time-frequency localization and noise robustness.

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models. Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder. This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search. Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

Summary:
- The study explores grokking, a phenomenon where models exhibit delayed generalization after overfitting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.
- Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a grokked model on one distribution can induce and accelerate grokking on another distribution, even with limited data.
- Training on a joint distribution can fail when data is insufficient, but distillation from grokked models on individual distributions enables generalization.
- Continual pretraining with KD allows for accelerated generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in transitioning between distributions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting, achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in low-data and evolving distribution settings.

We propose FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general cross-expression fusion of sparse operations.

It targets a cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications, our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight, treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However, existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts. Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity, which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE (Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition, we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

<div> framework, LLM serving, GPU, latency, throughput
Summary:
DuetServe is a new framework for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) that aims to achieve high throughput while meeting strict latency Service Level Objectives (SLOs) across prefill and decode phases. It operates on a single GPU and dynamically activates GPU spatial multiplexing to maintain isolation between the phases when necessary. The framework uses an attention-aware roofline model to predict latency, a partitioning optimizer to select optimal SM split for maximizing throughput under time-between-tokens (TBT) constraints, and an interruption-free execution engine to reduce CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations demonstrate that DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while ensuring low generation latency compared to existing frameworks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU. DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency, (2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

<div> Keywords: Simplex-FEM Networks, piecewise-polynomial predictor, finite-element field, warp, mesh

Summary: 
Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN) is a novel approach for representing functions using a globally continuous finite-element field on a learned simplicial mesh. By using barycentric coordinates, SiFEN achieves explicit locality and controllable smoothness, leading to improved efficiency and performance. By pairing Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with a warp and training with shape regularization, SiFEN can achieve the classic FEM approximation rate under certain assumptions. Empirical results show that SiFEN outperforms MLPs and KANs on various tasks while reducing inference latency and improving calibration. Overall, SiFEN offers a compact, interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization, semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact, interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks.

Summary:
PuzzleMoE is a new compression method for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that achieves high accuracy and efficient inference without the need for training. It incorporates sparse expert merging by identifying weight redundancy and specialization, using a dual-mask to capture shared and expert-specific parameters. Additionally, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses exponent bits to enable efficient MoE inference on GPUs. The method can compress MoE models by up to 50% while maintaining accuracy, outperforming prior methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at a 50% compression ratio. It also achieves up to 1.28 times inference speedup, making it a promising approach for scaling language models efficiently. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

Summary:
Autoencoders consist of an encoder and decoder that aim to capture the essence of a data manifold in a latent space. The goal is to map data points to a lower-dimensional space and back with minimal loss of information. This study delves into the topological challenges and advantages in finding an optimal autoencoder. It explores the intricacies of representing data manifolds and the constraints faced in the process. Additionally, the potential of autoencoders in capturing complex dynamical systems with invariant manifolds is discussed. The research sheds light on the fundamental principles underlying the search for efficient autoencoders and their applications in various fields.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space" $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an "encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon \mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

<br />
Summary: 
The volume hypothesis proposes that deep learning's effectiveness is due to finding flat minima with large volumes, which generalize well. However, this theory does not explain the impact of large datasets on generalization. Research on measuring minima volumes under different amounts of training data reveals the existence of sharp minima that generalize effectively, despite their small volumes. These minima are often overlooked due to their size. Increasing the dataset size alters the loss landscape, causing previously small minima that generalize well to become relatively larger and more likely to be discovered. <div>

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000 peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides. Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven antimicrobial peptide research.

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support vector machine.

Summary: 
This article discusses the challenges faced in addressing the potential of text-to-image generative models to produce harmful content. Two main approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue: fine-tuning models to unlearn harmful concepts and training-free guidance methods using negative prompts. However, combining these approaches has shown limited effectiveness, leading to a critical incompatibility between them. The authors propose a novel method that replaces negative prompts with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. This method requires no modifications to existing approaches and can be easily integrated into pipelines. Experimental validation on nudity and violence benchmarks shows improved defense success rates while preserving the core semantics of input prompts. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1) fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of input prompts.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces SPECTRA, a framework for molecular property prediction that addresses the challenge of sparse regions in the target space. By reconstructing multi-attribute molecular graphs and aligning molecule pairs through Gromov-Wasserstein couplings, SPECTRA generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. The framework uses a rarity-aware budgeting scheme to focus augmentation where data are scarce. Utilizing edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions in a spectral GNN, SPECTRA effectively densifies underrepresented regions without compromising global accuracy. Results on benchmarks show that SPECTRA improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall mean absolute error. Additionally, the synthesized molecules produced by SPECTRA exhibit interpretable structures that reflect the underlying spectral geometry. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral, geometry-aware augmentation in addressing imbalanced molecular property regression. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new integrator called the denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) for denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Unlike prior analyses that focused on exponential Euler discretization, DDRaM leverages a randomized midpoint for better SDE approximation. Using the "shifted composition rule" framework, the algorithm demonstrates favorable discretization properties with sublinear complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations for convergence. This is a significant improvement as it is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM sampling, contrasting prior works using ODE-based sampling. Experimental validations confirm DDRaM's practical advantages, particularly in conjunction with pre-trained image synthesis models. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of DDRaM in improving sample generation tasks within the realm of denoising diffusion probabilistic models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization, showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions, with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with pre-trained image synthesis models.

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices. Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures, Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes. The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally, the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language model, adaptation, environment-specific information, deployment-time dynamics grounding, generalization

Summary:
Two strategies are proposed to adapt Large Language Model (LLM) agents for better generalization to novel and complex environments. The first strategy involves online distributional adaptation to align the model's output distribution with environment-specific formats. The second strategy, deployment-time dynamics grounding, helps the agent learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution. Both strategies are shown to be effective across various benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation, with minimal computational cost. The dynamics grounding method proves particularly effective in complex environments with unpredictable dynamics, significantly improving the agent's success rate. For instance, on the WebArena multi-site split, the method boosts the success rate from 2% to 23%. These strategies offer a promising approach to enhancing the generalizability and capability of LLM-based agents in diverse environments.

arXiv:2511.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods, but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8% reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modelling.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) for continuous-action reinforcement learning. CSQBMs combine exponential-family priors with quantum Boltzmann distributions to reduce qubit requirements while maintaining strong expressiveness.

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness. Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms. Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

<div> Keywords: food banks, forecasting, reinforcement learning, metalearning, humanitarian supply chains

Summary:<br /><br />
The study introduces FoodRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the accuracy of forecasting in-kind donations for food banks. Traditional forecasting models struggle to adapt to the highly volatile nature of donations, influenced by seasonal variations and natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. FoodRL addresses these challenges by clustering and weighting diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual information. Tested on data from two U.S. food banks - one impacted by wildfires on the West Coast and the other by hurricanes on the East Coast - FoodRL consistently outperformed baseline methods, especially during disruptive periods. By providing more reliable and adaptive forecasts, FoodRL could potentially increase the redistribution of food by the equivalent of 1.7 million meals annually. This approach showcases the potential for adaptive ensemble learning in humanitarian supply chains, highlighting its significant social impact. <div>

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for humanitarian supply chains.

<div> Autonomous Vehicles, Mixed Autonomy Traffic, Collective Rationality, Deep Reinforcement Learning, System-Level Objectives <br /> 
Summary: <br /> 
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are set to join human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the roads, raising questions about how self-interested agents can benefit the overall traffic system. This study explores the concept of collective rationality (CR) in mixed autonomy traffic, where driving agents may cooperate for mutual gain despite pursuing individual interests. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a simple reward design, the research demonstrates the emergence of CR among self-interested traffic agents in various scenarios. Results indicate the robustness of this phenomenon, with a proposed mechanism explaining its occurrence in dynamic environments. The findings suggest the potential for leveraging advanced learning methods, such as federated learning, to foster collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in large language models have highlighted the potential of unsupervised reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning abilities without external supervision. However, the applicability of label-free RL methods to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities is not well understood. This study systematically investigates the performance of label-free RL across a range of model sizes and reasoning strengths, revealing significant limitations. It is found that smaller models struggle to generate sufficient chain-of-thought reasoning for effective self-reflection, with training data difficulty also playing a critical role in success. To address these challenges, a novel approach incorporating curriculum learning and data curation is proposed, demonstrating consistent enhancements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities. This method offers a promising direction for enhancing unsupervised RL and improving reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities, providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models.

Additionally, Craftax-Coop is introduced, adding complexity through heterogeneous agents and trading mechanics that require advanced cooperation.

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present \textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment, Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark, including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Summary: 
This paper explores the concept of multicalibration for elicitable properties in arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes, introducing the notion of swap multicalibration. A new oracle-efficient algorithm is proposed, leveraging an online agnostic learner to achieve improved $\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error rates with high probability. Specifically, for $r\geq2$, the algorithm achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error, significantly outperforming previous bounds. For the special case of $r=2$, the algorithm attains $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, addressing an open question on achieving $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean multicalibration error in a strongly affirmative manner. This work extends the understanding of multicalibration and elicitable properties in the online setting, offering efficient algorithms for achieving accurate predictions while ensuring algorithmic fairness. <div>
arXiv:2511.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property $\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property $\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following [GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$ $\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces Dual-Guided Loss (DGL) for decision-focused learning in optimization problems with predicted quantities.
- DGL aims to reduce solver dependence and improve performance by leveraging dual variables and introducing a scalable objective.
- It decouples optimization from gradient updates and periodically solves the downstream problem, training on dual-adjusted targets in between refreshes.
- DGL is designed specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path.
- The approach demonstrates asymptotically diminishing decision regret, has low runtime complexity, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer solver calls and less training time.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer, often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c) as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity, and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time.

Summary: <br />
Unlearning in large language models is essential for regulatory compliance and ethical AI development. Current unlearning methods, despite appearing successful under deterministic decoding, often fail to completely forget sensitive information when models are sampled with probabilistic decoding. A new metric called leak@$k quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge resurfacing during generation. Evaluating existing unlearning techniques using leak@$k on benchmarks like TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP reveals persistent knowledge leakage across tasks. This study highlights the inadequacy of current methods in achieving full forgetting in language models and emphasizes the need for more robust unlearning approaches. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2511.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these `unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies. Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

<br />
Summary: In this work, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters is investigated. The study focuses on the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the EM algorithm in the fully unknown setting. Explicit EM update expressions are derived for 2MLR with unknown parameters across all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The trajectory analysis reveals that in the noiseless case, the regression parameters in EM iterations follow a cycloid trajectory. The order of convergence is found to be linear or quadratic depending on the angle between the estimate and ground truth. Non-asymptotic guarantees are established by bounding statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, linking EM's accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work presents a novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing the EM algorithm in Mixed Linear Regression. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is crucial for healthcare institutions. This study addresses the growing prevalence of diabetes and its strong link to heart disease by proposing an efficient CVD risk prediction model for diabetic patients using machine learning (ML) and hybrid deep learning (DL) approaches. The BRFSS dataset was preprocessed by removing duplicates, handling missing values, identifying categorical and numerical features, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. Several ML models, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and XGBoost, were implemented, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050. Various DL models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, were also explored. Some of these models achieved perfect recall (1.00), with the LSTM model achieving the highest accuracy of 0.9050. Our research highlights the effectiveness of ML and DL models in predicting CVD risk among diabetic patients, automating and enhancing clinical decision-making. High accuracy and F1 scores demonstrate these models' potential to improve personalized risk management and preventive strategies.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces FAR-TS, a novel framework for generating multivariate time series data efficiently. FAR-TS combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer model over a discrete latent space to capture static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients. This approach allows for fast generation of time series of varying lengths, outperforming existing diffusion-based methods like Diffusion-TS. FAR-TS' streamlined design preserves data quality and interpretability of the latent space, enabling high-quality and flexible time series synthesis. The model's basis decomposition and vector quantization of temporal coefficients ensure efficient and controlled generation of time series data while maintaining cross-channel correlations. <div>
arXiv:2511.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a scalable variant of the ROC-SVM classifier that reduces computational complexity by leveraging incomplete U-statistics, making it more practical for real-world applications. The method extends to nonlinear classification by employing a low-rank kernel approximation for efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical analysis supports the proposed approximation with an error bound. Empirical results demonstrate that the new method achieves comparable area under the ROC curve (AUC) performance to the original ROC-SVM but with significantly reduced training time. This innovation addresses the limitation of the original ROC-SVM and makes it more feasible for use in scenarios with class imbalance. <div>
arXiv:2511.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance. However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation, enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation, and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM with drastically reduced training time.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models, neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these "black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP. Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME. Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, and Complexity to offer a nuanced method for assessing and comparing model explainability beyond simple accuracy metrics. This research demonstrates the feasibility of employing sophisticated, high performing ML models in regulated financial environments by utilizing modern explainability techniques and provides a structured approach to evaluate the crucial trade offs between model performance and interpretability.

<div> progressive training, deep learning, model depth, optimization theory, feature learning
Summary:
Progressive training in deep learning involves scaling up model capacity during training to reduce computation with minimal performance degradation. This study delves into the depth expansion of large models from an optimization theory and feature learning perspective. Insights are offered on aspects such as initializing new layers, transferring hyperparameters, defining learning rate schedules, and determining the timing of model expansion. The proposed zero/one-layer progressive training strategy enables an optimal tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, applying this method to GPT2 can lead to savings of approximately 80% in compute or a 5x acceleration while maintaining nearly the same loss compared to a fully trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters. <div>

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers, hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion. Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate $\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder. Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive small molecules from protein binding pockets.

<div> Breakpoints, deep learning, carbon price forecasting, structural break detection, wavelet signal denoising<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a hybrid framework for accurate carbon price forecasting by integrating structural break detection algorithms, wavelet signal denoising, and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, TCN). The framework, tested on European Union Allowance spot prices with exogenous features, outperforms existing models by reducing forecasting errors. The proposed PELT-WT-TCN model achieves the highest prediction accuracy, highlighting the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures for enhancing accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series. <div>
arXiv:2511.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches, have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by 70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

BiPETE, a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder, is proposed for disease risk prediction using electronic health records. It integrates rotary positional embeddings and sinusoidal embeddings to model temporal dependencies. Trained on EHR data from depressive disorder and PTSD cohorts for predicting alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD) risk, BiPETE outperforms baseline models with a 34% and 50% improvement in AUPRC. An ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. Integrated Gradients method is applied for model interpretation, revealing key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection. These include abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, medications, and comorbidities. The study offers a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, providing insights into the risk assessment process and potential risk mitigation strategies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

<div> learning, coordination, multi-agent, representation, decentralized

Summary:
1. The MAC-Flow framework addresses the trade-off between complexity and computational speed in multi-agent coordination.
2. Effective coordination requires a rich representation of joint behaviors from offline data and the ability to act efficiently in real time.
3. Prior approaches often sacrifice one aspect for the other, leading to either complex coordination but slow computation or fast execution but inability to handle multi-agent interactions.
4. MAC-Flow overcomes this trade-off by learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors and distilling it into decentralized one-step policies.
5. Across four benchmarks, MAC-Flow achieves significantly faster inference times compared to diffusion-based MARL methods while maintaining good performance, similar to prior Gaussian policy-based offline MARL methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However, prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and $34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$ faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods.

<div> Keywords: Federated fine-tuning, decentralized data, local drift, OvA-LP, robust FFT

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces OvA-LP, a framework designed to address drift in federated fine-tuning (FFT) models caused by heterogeneous client distributions. OvA-LP utilizes linear probing on a frozen encoder combined with a one-vs-all head and a two-stage procedure to suppress drift at its source. It retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy on CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, outperforming state-of-the-art FFT baselines like PFPT and FFT-MoE under the same conditions. OvA-LP also showcases resilience to symmetric and asymmetric label noise. Moreover, the precomputed encoder features ensure that the per-round cost is independent of the encoder size. Overall, OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient approach for achieving robust FFT performance in the presence of client heterogeneity. <div>
arXiv:2511.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure, preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition, precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

arXiv:2511.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular, complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA) dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent systems.

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear, sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model. This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

Summary: 
Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization is introduced to optimize objectives efficiently with minimal comparative evaluations and account for production and evaluation costs. The method constrains comparisons to involve previously generated candidates, reducing production cost. Incorporating a Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into the probabilistic preference model addresses perceptual ambiguity in feedback, capturing indifference to small utility differences. An information-theoretic acquisition strategy selects new configurations that are most informative under a preference model considering perceptual ambiguity. Empirical results show increased accuracy in setups with high production costs or indifference feedback. <div>
arXiv:2511.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs or with indifference feedback.

<div> Keywords: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, neuroendocrine tumors, predictive modeling, deep learning, multimodal fusion.

Summary:
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is commonly used for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, but predicting treatment outcomes remains challenging. This study aimed to develop predictive models for progression-free survival (PFS) in PRRT-treated patients. Data from 116 patients were analyzed, with laboratory values, imaging results, and deep learning models used to predict PFS. Short PFS (< 1 year) was observed in 36% of patients, associated with higher chromogranin A levels, elevated gamma-GT, and fewer PRRT cycles. A multimodal fusion model incorporating laboratory values, somatostatin receptor PET/CT, and CT imaging demonstrated the best predictive performance, outperforming unimodal approaches. This study highlights the potential of multimodal deep learning models to improve PFS prediction in PRRT-treated patients, paving the way for personalized treatment planning and follow-up strategies based on individual risk profiles.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2511.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory, imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected. Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches. Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps. Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1 year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch - achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01). Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Summary: 
Foundation models in bioacoustics, such as NatureLM, show promise in generalizing across species and tasks but may lack flexibility in instruction-following. Although NatureLM performs well when prompted for either common or scientific names individually, its accuracy decreases when both are requested in a single prompt. A model merging strategy is proposed to combine NatureLM with its base language model, enhancing instruction-following capabilities while preserving domain expertise. The merged model demonstrates significantly improved zero-shot generalization, surpassing previous benchmarks with a 200% relative improvement and achieving a new state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species. This approach addresses the trade-offs between domain expertise and instruction-following flexibility, showcasing the potential for enhanced performance in bioacoustic applications.

arXiv:2511.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise. Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

<div> generative models, data poisoning, associative poisoning, statistical integrity, countermeasure strategy

Summary:
Associative poisoning is a new data poisoning technique targeting generative models like Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT. Unlike existing attacks, it manipulates specific feature associations in generated data without needing control over the training process. This attack subtly alters training data to affect statistical relationships between features in outputs, maintaining high quality while evading detection. Evaluations on state-of-the-art models show its effectiveness in inducing or suppressing feature associations. The attack poses a threat to generative systems used in various applications like image synthesis and natural language processing by compromising their statistical integrity. Existing defenses have limitations in addressing this risk. A novel countermeasure strategy is proposed to mitigate the impact of associative poisoning attacks. <div>
arXiv:2511.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel countermeasure strategy.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing training cost. Our method uses approximate predicted gradients instead of the full gradients that require an expensive backward pass. We derive a control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer classification task.

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.

<title>The Causal Round Trip: Generating Authentic Counterfactuals by Eliminating Information Loss</title>

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

<title>An End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones</title>

arXiv:2511.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel, optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm. Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales (N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover, compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed framework significantly reduces the total training time required while achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects. This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$ injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied, while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty quantification for risk assessment.

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

<title>Attention and Compression is all you need for Controllably Efficient Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once, unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring 2-9x lower total memory usage.

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws, in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

<title>SAD-Flower: Flow Matching for Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically Consistent Planning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

arXiv:2511.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization. Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mikzuker/inverse_design_metasurface_generation.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment. To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through comprehensive numerical experiments.

arXiv:2511.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay (ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable, real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%. Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads, leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

We propose a clustered multitask approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within each cluster.

<title>Parameter-Efficient Conditioning for Material Generalization in Graph-Based Simulators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and 0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where material properties are treated as design variables.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering-based approaches for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, the application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics. Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these clustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM. Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised learning benchmarks. Inspection of the learned clusters reveals a strong resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of mislabeling.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are skillful, transferable and global.

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently, this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5% over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.

Abstract: We first study the generalization error of models that use a fixed feature representation (frozen intermediate layers) followed by a trainable readout layer. This setting encompasses a range of architectures, from deep random-feature models to echo-state networks (ESNs) with recurrent dynamics. Working in the high-dimensional regime, we apply Random Matrix Theory to derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic generalization error. We then apply this analysis to recurrent representations and obtain concise formula that characterize their performance. Surprisingly, we show that a linear ESN is equivalent to ridge regression with an exponentially time-weighted (''memory'') input covariance, revealing a clear inductive bias toward recent inputs. Experiments match predictions: ESNs win in low-sample, short-memory regimes, while ridge prevails with more data or long-range dependencies. Our methodology provides a general framework for analyzing overparameterized models and offers insights into the behavior of deep learning networks.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence (NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input, corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning, especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.

Abstract: Recent advances in long-context language models (LMs) have enabled million-token inputs, expanding their capabilities across complex tasks like computer-use agents. Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models, especially CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse downstream tasks. Soft prompts, as carefully crafted modules that efficiently adapt vision-language models to specific tasks, necessitate effective copyright protection. In this paper, we investigate model copyright protection by auditing whether suspicious third-party models incorporate protected soft prompts. While this can be viewed as a special case of model ownership auditing, our analysis shows that existing techniques are ineffective due to prompt learning's unique characteristics. Non-intrusive auditing is inherently prone to false positives when independent models share similar data distributions with victim models. Intrusive approaches also fail: backdoor methods designed for CLIP cannot embed functional triggers, while extending traditional DNN backdoor techniques to prompt learning suffers from harmfulness and ambiguity challenges. We find that these failures in intrusive auditing stem from the same fundamental reason: watermarking operates within the same decision space as the primary task yet pursues opposing objectives. Motivated by these findings, we propose sequential watermarking for soft prompts (SWAP), which implants watermarks into a different and more complex space. SWAP encodes watermarks through a specific order of defender-specified out-of-distribution classes, inspired by the zero-shot prediction capability of CLIP. This watermark, which is embedded in a more complex space, keeps the original prediction label unchanged, making it less opposed to the primary task. We further design a hypothesis-test-guided verification protocol for SWAP and provide theoretical analyses of success conditions. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate SWAP's effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

<title>First is Not Really Better Than Last: Evaluating Layer Choice and Aggregation Strategies in Language Model Data Influence Estimation</title>

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric, leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types. Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps, underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive multimodal research.

<title>CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation</title>

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++ optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones ($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals, $\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer $\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent $2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

<title>Machine Learning-Driven Analysis of kSZ Maps to Predict CMB Optical Depth $\tau$</title>

Abstract: Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density, would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$ and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.

Abstract: Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution (and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.

<title>MDM: Manhattan Distance Mapping of DNN Weights for Parasitic-Resistance-Resilient Memristive Crossbars</title>

arXiv:2511.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manhattan Distance Mapping (MDM) is a post-training deep neural network (DNN) weight mapping technique for memristive bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars that reduces parasitic resistance (PR) nonidealities.
  PR limits crossbar efficiency by mapping DNN matrices into small crossbar tiles, reducing CIM-based speedup. Each crossbar executes one tile, requiring digital synchronization before the next layer. At this granularity, designers either deploy many small crossbars in parallel or reuse a few sequentially-both increasing analog-to-digital conversions, latency, I/O pressure, and chip area.
  MDM alleviates PR effects by optimizing active-memristor placement. Exploiting bit-level structured sparsity, it feeds activations from the denser low-order side and reorders rows according to the Manhattan distance, relocating active cells toward regions less affected by PR and thus lowering the nonideality factor (NF).
  Applied to DNN models on ImageNet-1k, MDM reduces NF by up to 46% and improves accuracy under analog distortion by an average of 3.6% in ResNets. Overall, it provides a lightweight, spatially informed method for scaling CIM DNN accelerators.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation. Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data, while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance, providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation. Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies, such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong performance, and robustness under noisy observations.

<title>Trained on Tokens, Calibrated on Concepts: The Emergence of Semantic Calibration in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion in statistical learning literature to represent data using topological principles to capture structure and relationships. We propose a topological data analysis (TDA)-based framework, named Topological Prototype Selector (TPS), for selecting representative subsets (prototypes) from large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPS on simulated data under different data intrinsic characteristics, and compare TPS against other currently used prototype selection methods in real data settings. In all simulated and real data settings, TPS significantly preserves or improves classification performance while substantially reducing data size. These contributions advance both algorithmic and geometric aspects of prototype learning and offer practical tools for parallelized, interpretable, and efficient classification.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness: the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry; second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new, generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs, and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception.

<title>Predicting Cognitive Assessment Scores in Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Using Wearable Sensors</title>

Abstract: Background and Objectives: This paper focuses on using AI to assess the cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia using physiological data provided by a wearable device. Cognitive screening tools are disruptive, time-consuming, and only capture brief snapshots of activity. Wearable sensors offer an attractive alternative by continuously monitoring physiological signals. This study investigated whether physiological data can accurately predict scores on established cognitive tests. Research Design and Methods: We recorded physiological signals from 23 older adults completing three NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery tests, which assess working memory, processing speed, and attention. The Empatica EmbracePlus, a wearable device, measured blood volume pulse, skin conductance, temperature, and movement. Statistical features were extracted using wavelet-based and segmentation methods. We then applied supervised learning and validated predictions via cross-validation, hold-out testing, and bootstrapping. Results: Our models showed strong performance with Spearman's \rho of 0.73-0.82 and mean absolute errors of 0.14-0.16, significantly outperforming a naive mean predictor. Sensor roles varied: heart-related signals combined with movement and temperature best predicted working memory, movement paired with skin conductance was most informative for processing speed, and heart in tandem with skin conductance worked best for attention. Discussion and Implications: These findings suggest that wearable sensors paired with AI tools such as supervised learning and feature engineering can noninvasively track specific cognitive functions in older adults, enabling continuous monitoring. Our study demonstrates how AI can be leveraged when the data sample is small. This approach may support remote assessments and facilitate clinical interventions.

<title>Pluralistic Behavior Suite: Stress-Testing Multi-Turn Adherence to Custom Behavioral Policies</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet, real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements, use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Abstract: In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification, the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial applications.

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs) with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance. Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

<title>Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Retinal OCT Images: A UK Biobank Study</title>

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups. These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis, and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs, and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection, securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of next-generation programmable networks.

Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

<title>A New Framework for Convex Clustering in Kernel Spaces: Finite Sample Bounds, Consistency and Performance Insights</title>

Abstract: Convex clustering is a well-regarded clustering method, resembling the similar centroid-based approach of Lloyd's $k$-means, without requiring a predefined cluster count. It starts with each data point as its centroid and iteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when dealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures. To mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex clustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in this transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling of complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a finite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and establishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art clustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field, offering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data scenarios.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3 model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Abstract: Modelling how shocks propagate in supply chains is an increasingly important challenge in economics. Its relevance has been highlighted in recent years by events such as Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Agent-based models (ABMs) are a promising approach for this problem. However, calibrating them is hard. We show empirically that it is possible to achieve speed ups of over 3 orders of magnitude when calibrating ABMs of supply networks by running them on GPUs and using automatic differentiation, compared to non-differentiable baselines. This opens the door to scaling ABMs to model the whole global supply network.

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data, TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias, while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore, existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at https://github.com/joeeeeyin/CuisineSense.git.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has motivated formal theories of language generation and learning. We study the framework of \emph{language generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \subseteq M \subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property.

Abstract: Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) have become essential tools for helping employees navigate complex enterprise software such as CRM, ERP, or HRMS systems. Companies like LemonLearning have shown how digital guidance can reduce training costs and accelerate onboarding. However, building and maintaining these interactive guides still requires extensive manual effort. Leveraging Large Language Models as virtual assistants is an appealing alternative, yet without a structured understanding of the target software, LLMs often hallucinate and produce unreliable answers. Moreover, most production-grade LLMs are black-box APIs, making fine-tuning impractical due to the lack of access to model weights. In this work, we introduce a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that automatically converts enterprise web applications into state-action knowledge graphs, enabling LLMs to generate grounded and context-aware assistance. The framework was co-developed with the AI enterprise RAKAM, in collaboration with Lemon Learning. We detail the engineering pipeline that extracts and structures software interfaces, the design of the graph-based retrieval process, and the integration of our approach into production DAP workflows. Finally, we discuss scalability, robustness, and deployment lessons learned from industrial use cases.

However, GR often struggles to generalize and is costly to scale. We introduce QUESTER (QUEry SpecificaTion gEnerative Retrieval), which reframes GR as query specification generation - in this work, a simple keyword query handled by BM25 - using a (small) LLM. The policy is trained using reinforcement learning techniques (GRPO). Across in- and out-of-domain evaluations, we show that our model is more effective than BM25, and competitive with neural IR models, while maintaining a good efficiency

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an "evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.

<title>A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.

Abstract: Industry 5.0 aims at maximizing the collaboration between humans and machines. Machines are capable of automating repetitive jobs, while humans handle creative tasks. As a critical component of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems for service delivery, network data stream analytics often encounter concept drift issues due to dynamic IIoT environments, causing performance degradation and automation difficulties. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Automated Network Analytics (MSANA) framework for concept drift adaptation in IIoT systems, consisting of dynamic data pre-processing, the proposed Drift-based Dynamic Feature Selection (DD-FS) method, dynamic model learning & selection, and the proposed Window-based Performance Weighted Probability Averaging Ensemble (W-PWPAE) model. It is a complete automated data stream analytics framework that enables automatic, effective, and efficient data analytics for IIoT systems in Industry 5.0. Experimental results on two public IoT datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for IIoT data stream analytics.

<title>Non-stationary Delayed Online Convex Optimization: From Full-information to Bandit Setting</title>

Abstract: Although online convex optimization (OCO) under arbitrary delays has received increasing attention recently, previous studies focus on stationary environments with the goal of minimizing static regret. In this paper, we investigate the delayed OCO in non-stationary environments, and choose dynamic regret with respect to any sequence of comparators as the performance metric. To this end, we first propose an algorithm called Mild-OGD for the full-information case, where delayed gradients are available. The basic idea is to maintain multiple experts in parallel, each performing a gradient descent step with different learning rates for every delayed gradient according to their arrival order, and utilize a meta-algorithm to track the best one based on their delayed performance. Despite the simplicity of this idea, our novel analysis shows that the dynamic regret of Mild-OGD can be automatically bounded by $O(\sqrt{\bar{d}T(P_T+1)})$ under the in-order assumption and $O(\sqrt{dT(P_T+1)})$ in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ and $d$ denote the average and maximum delay respectively, $T$ is the time horizon, and $P_T$ is the path-length of comparators. Moreover, we demonstrate that the result in the worst case is optimal by deriving a matching lower bound. Finally, we develop a bandit variant of Mild-OGD for a more challenging case with only delayed loss values. Interestingly, we prove that under a relatively large amount of delay, our bandit algorithm even enjoys the best dynamic regret bound of existing non-delayed bandit algorithms.

<title>Learning for Interval Prediction of Electricity Demand: A Cluster-based Bootstrapping Approach</title>

Abstract: Accurate predictions of electricity demands are necessary for managing operations in a small aggregation load setting like a Microgrid. Due to low aggregation, the electricity demands can be highly stochastic and point estimates would lead to inflated errors. Interval estimation in this scenario, would provide a range of values within which the future values might lie and helps quantify the errors around the point estimates. This paper introduces a residual bootstrap algorithm to generate interval estimates of day-ahead electricity demand. A machine learning algorithm is used to obtain the point estimates of electricity demand and respective residuals on the training set. The obtained residuals are stored in memory and the memory is further partitioned. Days with similar demand patterns are grouped in clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm and these clusters are used to partition the memory. The point estimates for test day are used to find the closest cluster of similar days and the residuals are bootstrapped from the chosen cluster. This algorithm is evaluated on the real electricity demand data from EULR(End Use Load Research) and is compared to other bootstrapping methods for varying confidence intervals.

Abstract: We show that differentially private full fine-tuning (DP-FFT) can distort pre-trained backbone features based on both theoretical and empirical results. We identify the cause of the distortion as the misalignment between the pre-trained backbone and the randomly initialized linear head. We prove that a sequential fine-tuning strategy can mitigate the feature distortion: first-linear-probing-then-fine-tuning (DP-LP-FFT). A new approximation scheme allows us to derive approximate upper and lower bounds on the training loss of DP-LP and DP-FFT, in a simple but canonical setting of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation. Experiments on real-world datasets and architectures are consistent with our theoretical insights. We also derive new upper bounds for 2-layer linear networks without the approximation. Moreover, our theory suggests a trade-off of privacy budget allocation in multi-phase fine-tuning methods like DP-LP-FFT.

Our results demonstrate that it is beneficial to separate high-level decision-making processes and low-level control actions between the reinforcement learning agent and the low-level controllers based on physical models. In the following, we study optimizing the performance with a realistic and multi-objective reward function based on Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) of the truck using different approaches; by adding weights to reward components, by normalizing the reward components and by using curriculum learning techniques.

Abstract: Tabular data is prevalent across diverse domains in machine learning. With the rapid progress of deep tabular prediction methods, especially pretrained (foundation) models, there is a growing need to evaluate these methods systematically and to understand their behavior. We present an extensive study on TALENT, a collection of 300+ datasets spanning broad ranges of size, feature composition (numerical/categorical mixes), domains, and output types (binary, multi--class, regression). Our evaluation shows that ensembling benefits both tree-based and neural approaches. Traditional gradient-boosted trees remain very strong baselines, yet recent pretrained tabular models now match or surpass them on many tasks, narrowing--but not eliminating--the historical advantage of tree ensembles. Despite architectural diversity, top performance concentrates within a small subset of models, providing practical guidance for method selection. To explain these outcomes, we quantify dataset heterogeneity by learning from meta-features and early training dynamics to predict later validation behavior. This dynamics-aware analysis indicates that heterogeneity--such as the interplay of categorical and numerical attributes--largely determines which family of methods is favored. Finally, we introduce a two-level design beyond the 300 common-size datasets: a compact TALENT-tiny core (45 datasets) for rapid, reproducible evaluation, and a TALENT-extension suite targeting high-dimensional, many-class, and very large-scale settings for stress testing. In summary, these results offer actionable insights into the strengths, limitations, and future directions for improving deep tabular learning.

Abstract: State-of-the-art medical multi-modal LLMs (med-MLLMs), such as LLaVA-Med and BioMedGPT, primarily depend on scaling model size and data volume, with training driven largely by autoregressive objectives. However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce ExGra-Med, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, ExGra-Med matches LLaVA-Med's performance using just 10% of the pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BioMedGPT and RadFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.

Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimensions. We provide error bounds for this approximation, assuming that the Kolmogorov-Arnold expansion functions are sufficiently smooth. When the function is only continuous, we also provide universal approximation theorems. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: it outperforms all networks for irregular functions and achieves similar accuracy to the original spline-based KAN network for smooth functions. Finally, we compare some of the KAN networks in optimizing a French hydraulic valley.

Abstract: Meta-learning enables learning systems to adapt quickly to new tasks, similar to humans. Different meta-learning approaches all work under/with the mini-batch episodic training framework. Such framework naturally gives the information about task identity, which can serve as additional supervision for meta-training to improve generalizability. We propose to exploit task identity as additional supervision in meta-training, inspired by the alignment and discrimination ability which is is intrinsic in human's fast learning. This is achieved by contrasting what meta-learners learn, i.e., model representations. The proposed ConML is evaluating and optimizing the contrastive meta-objective under a problem- and learner-agnostic meta-training framework. We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with existing meta-learners, as well as in-context learning models, and brings significant boost in performance with small implementation cost.

Abstract: Training large models with millions or even billions of parameters from scratch incurs substantial computational costs. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address this challenge by adapting only a reduced number of parameters to specific tasks with gradient-based optimizers. In this paper, we cast PEFT as an optimal filtering/state estimation problem and present Low-Rank Kalman Optimizer (LoKO) to estimate the optimal trainable parameters in an online manner. We leverage the low-rank decomposition in LoRA to significantly reduce matrix sizes in Kalman iterations and further capitalize on a diagonal approximation of the covariance matrix to effectively decrease computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of trainable parameters. Moreover, we discovered that the initialization of the covariance matrix within the Kalman algorithm and the accurate estimation of the observation noise covariance are the keys in this formulation, and we propose robust approaches that work well across a vast range of well-established computer vision and language models. Our results show that LoKO converges with fewer iterations and yields better performance models compared to commonly used optimizers with LoRA in both image classifications and language tasks. Our study opens up the possibility of leveraging the Kalman filter as an effective optimizer for the online fine-tuning of large models.

Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework that captures distribution shifts that occur during the training of machine learning models due to their deployment. As the trained model is used, data generation causes the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution. The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in federated learning is increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases. A recently proposed approach extends performative prediction to federated learning with the resulting model converging to a performative stable point, which may be far from the performative optimal point. Earlier research in centralized settings has shown that the performative optimal point can be achieved under model-induced distribution shifts, but these approaches require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic federated learning systems. This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative Robust Optimal Federated Learning, an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in federated learning from noisy and contaminated data. We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the advantage of Robust Optimal Federated Learning over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA).
  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.

Abstract: Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: This article surveys Cognitive Edge Computing as a practical and methodical pathway for deploying reasoning-capable Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents on resource-constrained devices at the network edge. We present a unified, cognition-preserving framework spanning: (1) model optimization (quantization, sparsity, low-rank adaptation, distillation) aimed at retaining multi-step reasoning under tight memory/compute budgets; (2) system architecture (on-device inference, elastic offloading, cloud-edge collaboration) that trades off latency, energy, privacy, and capacity; and (3) adaptive intelligence (context compression, dynamic routing, federated personalization) that tailors computation to task difficulty and device constraints. We synthesize advances in efficient Transformer design, multimodal integration, hardware-aware compilation, privacy-preserving learning, and agentic tool use, and map them to edge-specific operating envelopes. We further outline a standardized evaluation protocol covering latency, throughput, energy per token, accuracy, robustness, privacy, and sustainability, with explicit measurement assumptions to enhance comparability. Remaining challenges include modality-aware reasoning benchmarks, transparent and reproducible energy reporting, edge-oriented safety/alignment evaluation, and multi-agent testbeds. We conclude with practitioner guidelines for cross-layer co-design of algorithms, runtime, and hardware to deliver reliable, efficient, and privacy-preserving cognitive capabilities on edge devices.

Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches assume collaborative clients with aligned objectives working towards a shared global model. However, in many real-world scenarios, clients act as rational players with individual objectives and strategic behaviors, a concept that existing FL frameworks are not equipped to adequately address. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multiplayer Federated Learning (MpFL), a novel framework that models the clients in the FL environment as players in a game-theoretic context, aiming to reach an equilibrium. In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their own utility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, we propose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithm in which each player/client performs local updates independently and periodically communicates with other players. We theoretically analyze PEARL-SGD and prove that it reaches a neighborhood of equilibrium with less communication in the stochastic setup compared to its non-local counterpart. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Computational cognitive models, which formalize theories of cognition, enable researchers to quantify cognitive processes and arbitrate between competing theories by fitting models to behavioral data. Traditionally, these models are handcrafted, which requires significant domain knowledge, coding expertise, and time investment. However, recent advances in machine learning offer solutions to these challenges. In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for in-context pattern recognition, leveraging knowledge from diverse domains to solve complex problems, and generating executable code that can be used to facilitate the generation of cognitive models. Building on this potential, we introduce a pipeline for Guided generation of Computational Cognitive Models (GeCCo). Given task instructions, participant data, and a template function, GeCCo prompts an LLM to propose candidate models, fits proposals to held-out data, and iteratively refines them based on feedback constructed from their predictive performance. We benchmark this approach across four different cognitive domains -- decision making, learning, planning, and memory -- using three open-source LLMs, spanning different model sizes, capacities, and families. On four human behavioral data sets, the LLM generated models that consistently matched or outperformed the best domain-specific models from the cognitive science literature. Taken together, our results suggest that LLMs can generate cognitive models with conceptually plausible theories that rival -- or even surpass -- the best models from the literature across diverse task domains.

Abstract: In classification tasks, softmax functions are ubiquitously used as output activations to produce predictive probabilities. Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling. We evaluate it combined with several approximate Gaussian inference methods (Laplace, HET, SNGP) on large- and small-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10), demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification capabilities compared to softmax MC sampling. Our code is available at https://github.com/bmucsanyi/probit.

<title>Two-stage hybrid models for enhancing forecasting accuracy on heterogeneous time series</title>

Abstract: A time series forecasting model--which is typically built on a single time series--is known as a local time series model (tsLM). In contrast, a forecasting model trained on multiple time series is referred to as a global time series model (tsGM). tsGMs can enhance forecasting accuracy and improve generalisation by learning cross-series information. As such, developing tsGMs has become a prominent research focus within the time series forecasting community. However, the benefits of tsGMs may not always be realised if the given set of time series is heterogeneous. While increasing model complexity can help tsGMs adapt to such a set of data, it can also increase the risk of overfitting and forecasting error. Additionally, the definition of homogeneity remains ambiguous in the literature. To address these challenges, this paper explores how to define data heterogeneity and proposes a two-stage modelling framework: At stage one, a tsGM is learnt to identify homogeneous patterns; and at stage two, tsLMs (e.g., ARIMA) or sub-tsGMs tailored to different groups are learnt to capture the heterogeneity. Numerical experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art models. These results highlight its effectiveness in unlocking the full potential of global forecasting models for heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows-the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether an LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present AIRepr, an Analyst-Inspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the reproducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Transformer models typically calculate attention matrices using dot products, which have limitations when capturing nonlinear relationships between embedding vectors. We propose Neural Attention, a technique that replaces dot products with feed-forward networks, enabling a more expressive representation of relationships between tokens. This approach modifies only the attention matrix calculation while preserving the matrix dimensions, making it easily adaptable to existing transformer-based architectures. We provide a detailed mathematical justification for why Neural Attention increases representational capacity and conduct controlled experiments to validate this claim. When comparing Neural Attention and Dot-Product Attention, NLP experiments on WikiText-103 show a reduction in perplexity of over 2 percent. Similarly, experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show improvements in accuracy of more than 4 percentage points for image classification tasks. While Neural Attention introduces higher computational demands, we develop techniques to mitigate these challenges, ensuring practical usability without sacrificing the increased expressivity it provides. This work establishes Neural Attention as an effective means of enhancing the predictive capabilities of transformer models across a variety of applications. The code for all experiments is available at https://github.com/awayfromzel/neural-attention-research.

Abstract: We study the greedy (exploitation-only) algorithm in bandit problems with a known reward structure. We allow arbitrary finite reward structures, while prior work focused on a few specific ones. We fully characterize when the greedy algorithm asymptotically succeeds or fails, in the sense of sublinear vs. linear regret as a function of time. Our characterization identifies a partial identifiability property of the problem instance as the necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic success. Notably, once this property holds, the problem becomes easy -- any algorithm will succeed (in the same sense as above), provided it satisfies a mild non-degeneracy condition. Our characterization extends to contextual bandits and interactive decision-making with arbitrary feedback. Examples demonstrating broad applicability and extensions to infinite reward structures are provided.

<title>Large language models as uncertainty-calibrated optimizers for experimental discovery</title>

Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly depends on efficient experimental optimization to navigate vast design spaces under time and resource constraints. Traditional approaches often require extensive domain expertise and feature engineering. While large language models, with their vast scientific knowledge, circumvent the feature engineering limitations, they lack the calibrated uncertainty estimates required for high-stakes decision making. Hence, current optimization methods force a choice between domain knowledge and reliability, with no principled approach that affords both. In this work, we show that training language models through the uncertainty-aware objectives of traditional optimization methods enables their use as reliable optimizers guided by natural language. By teaching LLMs from experimental outcomes under uncertainty, we transform their overconfidence from a fundamental limitation into a precise calibration mechanism. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reactions, a cornerstone of pharmaceutical synthesis, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-yielding reaction conditions, from 24% to 43% in 50 experimental iterations starting from 10 unsuccessful conditions. Across 19 diverse optimization problems spanning organic synthesis, materials science and catalysis, process chemistry, and molecular design, our approach ranks first on average, establishing a new paradigm for reliable, uncertainty-guided optimization with LLMs. Our approach can accelerate discovery by lowering the barrier to using powerful optimization methods, replacing the need for domain-specific feature engineering with more accessible natural language interfaces. These findings highlight that ensuring reliability through principled uncertainty quantification is critical for realizing the full potential of AI-guided experimentation.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

Abstract: In concept erasure, a model is modified to selectively prevent it from generating a target concept. Despite the rapid development of new methods, it remains unclear how thoroughly these approaches remove the target concept from the model. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) interfering with the model's internal guidance processes, and (ii) reducing the unconditional likelihood of generating the target concept, potentially removing it entirely. To assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a comprehensive suite of independent probing techniques: supplying visual context, modifying the diffusion trajectory, applying classifier guidance, and analyzing the model's alternative generations that emerge in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the value of exploring concept erasure robustness outside of adversarial text inputs, and emphasize the importance of comprehensive evaluations for erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) are powerful amortized samplers for Boltzmann distributions; however, imperfect score estimates bias downstream Monte Carlo estimates. Classical importance sampling (IS) can correct this bias, but computing exact likelihoods requires solving the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), a procedure that is prohibitively costly and scales poorly with dimensionality. We introduce Variance-Tuned Diffusion Importance Sampling (VT-DIS), a lightweight post-training method that adapts the per-step noise covariance of a pretrained SBDM by minimizing the $\alpha$-divergence ($\alpha=2$) between its forward diffusion and reverse denoising trajectories. VT-DIS assigns a single trajectory-wise importance weight to the joint forward-reverse process, yielding unbiased expectation estimates at test time with negligible overhead compared to standard sampling. On the DW-4, LJ-13, and alanine-dipeptide benchmarks, VT-DIS achieves effective sample sizes of approximately 80 %, 35 %, and 3.5 %, respectively, while using only a fraction of the computational budget required by vanilla diffusion + IS or PF-ODE-based IS.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while ensuring compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy, we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight greedy-optimal policy that provably limits update frequency and cost. Experimental results on four domain generalization datasets demonstrate that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.

Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$ adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior JKO-based methods.

Abstract: With the emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in decision-making scenarios, it is imperative to regulate model fairness to prevent disparities across sensitive groups (e.g., female, male). Current research predominantly focuses on two concepts of group fairness within FL: Global Fairness (overall model disparity across all clients) and Local Fairness (the disparity within each client). However, the non-decomposable, non-differentiable nature of fairness criteria poses two fundamental, unresolved challenges for fair FL: (i) Harmonizing global and local fairness, especially in multi-class setting; (ii) Enabling a controllable, optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel controllable federated group-fairness calibration framework, named FedFACT. FedFACT identifies the Bayes-optimal classifiers under both global and local fairness constraints, yielding models with minimal performance decline while guaranteeing fairness. Building on the characterization of the optimal fair classifiers, we reformulate fair federated learning as a personalized cost-sensitive learning problem for in-processing and a bi-level optimization for post-processing. Theoretically, we provide convergence and generalization guarantees for FedFACT to approach the near-optimal accuracy under given fairness levels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various data heterogeneity demonstrate that FedFACT consistently outperforms baselines in balancing accuracy and global-local fairness.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by 12.0 points on AIME 24, 8.6 on GPQA, and 9.7 on LiveCodeBench on average for an equivalent number of memory reads.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning models with uncertainty quantification, offering formal coverage guarantees under exchangeable data. However, these guarantees fail when faced with subpopulation shifts, where the test environment contains a different mix of subpopulations than the calibration data. In this work, we focus on unknown subpopulation shifts where we are not given group-information i.e. the subpopulation labels of datapoints have to be inferred. We propose new methods that provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage without explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. While existing methods in similar setups assume perfect subpopulation labels, our framework explicitly relaxes this requirement and characterizes conditions where formal coverage guarantees remain feasible. Further, our algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings and remain practical in realistic machine learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods reliably maintain coverage and effectively control risks in scenarios where standard conformal prediction fails.

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as auto-compression, the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2) answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of AI assistants in healthcare.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, in which one optimization problem is nested inside another, underlies many machine learning applications with a hierarchical structure -- such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. Such applications often involve sensitive training data, raising pressing concerns about individual privacy. Motivated by this, we study differentially private bilevel optimization. We first focus on settings where the outer-level objective is convex, and provide novel upper and lower bounds on the excess empirical risk for both pure and approximate differential privacy. These bounds are nearly tight and essentially match the optimal rates for standard single-level differentially private ERM, up to additional terms that capture the intrinsic complexity of the nested bilevel structure. We also provide population loss bounds for bilevel stochastic optimization. The bounds are achieved in polynomial time via efficient implementations of the exponential and regularized exponential mechanisms. A key technical contribution is a new method and analysis of log-concave sampling under inexact function evaluations, which may be of independent interest. In the non-convex setting, we develop novel algorithms with state-of-the-art rates for privately finding approximate stationary points. Notably, our bounds do not depend on the dimension of the inner problem.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically lower energy function evaluations.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving $o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the quality of instances is costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations, in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more critical in reinforcement learning, since it relies on interactions with the environment (i.e., new instances) that must be evaluated to provide a reward signal for learning. At the same time, performing sufficient exploration is crucial in reinforcement learning to find high-rewarding solutions, meaning that the agent should observe and learn from a diverse set of experiences to find different solutions. Thus, we argue that learning from a diverse mini-batch of experiences can have a large impact on the exploration and help mitigate mode collapse.In this paper, we introduce mini-batch diversification for reinforcement learning and study this framework in the context of a real-world problem, namely, drug discovery. We extensively evaluate how our proposed framework can enhance the effectiveness of chemical exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality solutions is crucial. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed diverse mini-batch selection framework can substantially enhance the diversity of solutions while maintaining high-quality solutions. In drug discovery, such an outcome can potentially lead to fulfilling unmet medical needs faster.

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step; rather than always applying the highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using prior knowledge, and can correct this knowledge when contradicted by data. Finally, LGES can use interventional data to refine the learned observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true equivalence class in the sample limit, even with misspecified knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to misspecified knowledge. Our code is available at https://github.com/CausalAILab/lges.

<title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM proba- bilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

<title>Learning Latent Graph Geometry via Fixed-Point Schr\"odinger-Type Activation: A Theoretical Study</title>

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for neural architectures whose internal representations evolve as stationary states of dissipative Schr\"odinger-type dynamics on learned latent graphs. Each layer is defined by a fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type equation depending on a weighted Laplacian encoding latent geometry and a convex local potential. We prove existence, uniqueness, and smooth dependence of equilibria, and show that the dynamics are equivalent under the Bloch map to norm-preserving Landau--Lifshitz flows. Training over graph weights and topology is formulated as stochastic optimization on a stratified moduli space of graphs equipped with a natural K\"{a}hler--Hessian metric, ensuring convergence and differentiability across strata. We derive generalization bounds -- PAC-Bayes, stability, and Rademacher complexity -- in terms of geometric quantities such as edge count, maximal degree, and Gromov--Hausdorff distortion, establishing that sparsity and geometric regularity control capacity. Feed-forward composition of stationary layers is proven equivalent to a single global stationary diffusion on a supra-graph; backpropagation is its adjoint stationary system. Finally, directed and vector-valued extensions are represented as sheaf Laplacians with unitary connections, unifying scalar graph, directed, and sheaf-based architectures. The resulting model class provides a compact, geometrically interpretable, and analytically tractable foundation for learning latent graph geometry via fixed-point Schr\"odinger-type activations.

<title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>

Abstract: Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.

<title>A Perfectly Truthful Calibration Measure</title>

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and, therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. A calibration measure quantifies how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities. Predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, but in reality, when calibration is evaluated on a random sample, all known calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more calibrated. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch setting.
  We design a simple, perfectly and strictly truthful, sound and complete calibration measure in the batch setting: averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). ATB is quadratically related to two existing calibration measures: the smooth calibration error smCal and the lower distance to calibration distCal. The simplicity in our definition of ATB makes it efficient and straightforward to compute, allowing us to give the first linear-time calibration testing algorithm, improving a result of Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for constructing truthful measures based on the variance additivity of independent random variables, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding credible and transparent ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort. This work provides a reproducible benchmark for Safe RL with explicitly ethics-aware objectives in human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments. Across two interactive benchmarks and five random seeds, our policy decreases conflict frequency by 25-45% compared to matched task successes while maintaining comfort metrics within 5%.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge. The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding 55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.

Abstract: We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures. Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human resources.

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive inference costs--techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step verification can require $10-100\times$ more compute per query than standard decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks, ALS achieves $2-5\times$ speedup over iterative methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101% improvement in efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning techniques viable for production deployment.

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of social regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our WOFTRL recovers the good performances that social regret is constant in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies last-iterate converge to the Nash equilibrium in poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and strengthened by our experiments.

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy RL, sustaining continuous scaling across $3,000$ training steps and $81,204$ GPU-hours, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons, clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee, reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability. To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B, HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA. Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Abstract: Synthetic Control Methods (SCMs) have become a fundamental tool for comparative case studies. The core idea behind SCMs is to estimate treatment effects by predicting counterfactual outcomes for a treated unit using a weighted combination of observed outcomes from untreated units. The accuracy of these predictions is crucial for evaluating the treatment effect of a policy intervention. Subsequent research has therefore focused on estimating SC weights. In this study, we highlight a key endogeneity issue in existing SCMs-namely, the correlation between the outcomes of untreated units and the error term of the synthetic control, which leads to bias in both counterfactual outcome prediction and treatment effect estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel SCM based on moment matching, assuming that the outcome distribution of the treated unit can be approximated by a weighted mixture of the distributions of untreated units. Under this assumption, we estimate SC weights by matching the moments of the treated outcomes with the weighted sum of the moments of the untreated outcomes. Our method offers three advantages: first, under the mixture model assumption, our estimator is asymptotically unbiased; second, this asymptotic unbiasedness reduces the mean squared error in counterfactual predictions; and third, our method provides full distributions of the treatment effect rather than just expected values, thereby broadening the applicability of SCMs. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in R\'enyi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem -- we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the target distribution.

Abstract: We construct a new representation of entropy solutions to nonlinear scalar conservation laws with a smooth convex flux function in a single spatial dimension. The representation is a generalization of the method of characteristics and posseses a compositional form. While it is a nonlinear representation, the embedded dynamics of the solution in the time variable is linear. This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate whether noise-augmented training can concurrently improve adversarial robustness in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We conduct a comparative analysis of the adversarial robustness of four different ASR architectures, each trained under three different augmentation conditions: (1) background noise, speed variations, and reverberations; (2) speed variations only; (3) no data augmentation. We then evaluate the robustness of all resulting models against attacks with white-box or black-box adversarial examples. Our results demonstrate that noise augmentation not only enhances model performance on noisy speech but also improves the model's robustness to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising approach to enhance their capabilities, especially for complex tasks. Synthesizing tool-use data through real-world simulations is an effective way to achieve this. However, our investigation reveals that training gains significantly decay as synthetic data increases. The model struggles to benefit from additional synthetic data, which fails to endow it with advanced tool-use capabilities in complex scenarios Moreover, we discovered that the above limitation usually manifests as a fragment deficiency (i.e., parameter errors) in response. To this end, we propose an iterative reinforced fine-tuning strategy designed to alleviate this limitation. This strategy involves: (1) enhancing the diversity of response for synthetic data through path exploration of Monte Carlo Tree Search. (2) iteratively pinpointing the model's deficiency by constructing fine-grained preference pairs, and then improving it by preference optimization algorithms for targeted improvement. The experiments show that our method achieves 13.11% better performance than the same-size base model. It achieves an improvement of 6.5% in complex scenarios compared to the baseline, and it also outperforms larger open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a powerful framework for enhancing statistical estimates by combining limited gold-standard data with machine learning (ML) predictions. While prior work has demonstrated PPI's benefits for individual statistical problems, modern applications require answering numerous parallel statistical questions. We introduce Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage (PAS), a method that bridges PPI with empirical Bayes shrinkage to improve the estimation of multiple means. PAS debiases noisy ML predictions within each task and then borrows strength across tasks by using those same predictions as a reference point for shrinkage. The amount of shrinkage is determined by minimizing an unbiased estimate of risk, and we prove that this tuning strategy is asymptotically optimal. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PAS adapts to the reliability of the ML predictions and outperforms traditional and modern baselines in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. These mechanisms maintain the integrity of LLM alignment by guaranteeing that the models respond safely and ethically. In response to this, attacks on LLMs are a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated their effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing LLM attacks mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel approach that exploits these unique patterns to break the security and alignment constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our approach.

Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question--answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request--response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU). These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach -- performed via quantile regression -- that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning, particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces, spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

<div> Pattern Embedded Neural Networks, multivariate nonparametric regression, missing covariates, imputation technique, excess risk bound

Summary:
Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs) are proposed for multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates. PENNs utilize neural networks trained on imputed data and pass observation indicators through a second network for a compact representation. A theoretical result shows that PENNs achieve the minimax rate of convergence, even without prior knowledge of observation patterns. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements over standard neural networks. The method's code and tutorial are publicly available. <div>

Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.

<div> benchmark, virology, language model, troubleshooting, governance

Summary:
The Virology Capabilities Test (VCT) is a benchmark test created for measuring the ability of large language models (LLMs) to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. It consists of 322 questions covering fundamental virology knowledge and is challenging even for expert virologists. The LLM model OpenAI's o3 achieved a high accuracy rate on the VCT, outperforming a significant percentage of expert virologists. This capability of LLMs to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting raises governance concerns due to the dual-use nature of such skills. It can be beneficial for research but also potentially misused, highlighting the need for frameworks to regulate the use of LLMs in the life sciences field. <div>

Abstract: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.

Summary: <br />
The paper presents a novel approach to developing an interpretable neural network-based behavior detection model. The model aims to detect gaming-the-system behavior in education using fully interpretable parameters that capture the model's learned knowledge. By implementing constraints that simplify the inference process and align the model with human understanding, the approach successfully identifies patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior. The model's performance is evaluated, showing its ability to provide faithful and intelligible explanations. Comparison with human experts' findings further validates the model's effectiveness in detecting target behavior. The paper discusses the implications of the approach and suggests utilizing a human-grounded evaluation method to assess explainability in machine learning models. <div>

Abstract: The increasing use of complex machine learning models in education has led to concerns about their interpretability, which in turn has spurred interest in developing explainability techniques that are both faithful to the model's inner workings and intelligible to human end-users. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on improving the Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) model by incorporating gated recurrent units (LSTMs and GRUs) to enhance the capture of long-term dependencies. The implementation is revamped using the PyTorch framework for improved extensibility and reproducibility. Various optimization algorithms, including SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and AdamW, are benchmarked to assess their impact on model convergence speed and predictive accuracy in educational tasks. Results from experiments on Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy datasets indicate that LSTMs and GRUs outperform basic RNNs in accuracy and training stability. Furthermore, adaptive optimizers like Adam and AdamW show consistent improvement over SGD in both early-stage learning and overall model performance. The open-source PyTorch implementation provided in this work offers a reliable foundation for future research in neural knowledge tracing and personalized learning systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models student learning behavior by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future performance based on historical interaction data. However, the original implementation relied on standard RNNs in the Lua-based Torch framework, which limited extensibility and reproducibility. In this work, we revisit the DKT model from two perspectives: architectural improvements and optimization efficiency. First, we enhance the model using gated recurrent units, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which better capture long-term dependencies and help mitigate vanishing gradient issues. Second, we re-implement DKT using the PyTorch framework, enabling a modular and accessible infrastructure compatible with modern deep learning workflows. We also benchmark several optimization algorithms SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and AdamW to evaluate their impact on convergence speed and predictive accuracy in educational modeling tasks. Experiments on the Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy datasets show that GRUs and LSTMs achieve higher accuracy and improved training stability compared to basic RNNs, while adaptive optimizers such as Adam and AdamW consistently outperform SGD in both early-stage learning and final model performance. Our open-source PyTorch implementation provides a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research in neural knowledge tracing and personalized learning systems.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces StarPO, a framework for trajectory-level agent reinforcement learning (RL) training, focusing on large language models (LLMs). The research presents RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents in multi-turn RL tasks. The study identifies a recurring issue termed Echo Trap in agent RL training, which is addressed by a stabilized variant, StarPO-S. The shaping of RL rollouts is found to benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity, and frequent sampling. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals in enabling agent reasoning to emerge in multi-turn RL scenarios, preventing agents from adopting shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. The code and environments used in the study are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on three stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and decoupled clipping. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. Code and environments are available at https://github.com/RAGEN-AI/RAGEN.

<div> Keywords: Deep Neural Networks, Adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition, Energy expenditure, Model compression, Accuracy

Summary:
In the paper, a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) method is introduced to address the limitations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in terms of memory and computational constraints. Unlike traditional SVD compression techniques that apply a fixed rank reduction across all layers, ARSVD dynamically selects the rank increase for fully connected layers based on energy distribution. This adaptive approach aims to balance compression and model performance by optimizing energy usage while minimizing accuracy loss on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Results show that the ARSVD method effectively compresses models while maintaining high classification accuracy and F1-score, making it valuable for scenarios with limited computational and memory resources.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often constrained by their large memories and computational restrictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) that dynamically chooses the rank increase of the fully connected layers below a certain threshold in energy expenditure. Unlike conventional SVD compression methods that apply a fixed rank reduction in all layers, our ARSVD method uses energy distribution to adaptively select rank per layer while retaining accuracy. This is done for each layer in an effort to use as much energy as possible while maintaining the lowest accuracy loss. Such accuracy-adaptive approaches outperform traditional static rank reduction methods by providing an improved balance between compression and model performance. We first train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 dataset and evaluate its performance using accuracy and F1-score. After applying ARSVD, our results demonstrate that the technique can achieve substantial model compression without compromising classification accuracy. These results illustrate the usefulness of ARSVD in computing scenarios where both computational and memory resources are scarce.

<div> Keywords: Differentiable Architecture Search, Flexible DARTS, Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking, Neural Architectures, Image Classification

Summary:
Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) aims to reduce prior constraints in Differentiable Architecture Search by allowing more architectural flexibility. FX-DARTS eliminates restrictions on cell topology and modifies the discretization mechanism for super-networks. The method leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework to address challenges and maintain stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks show that FX-DARTS can explore neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure. The approach enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules, opening up possibilities for the development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and exploring more powerful networks. <div>
arXiv:2504.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.

<div> Keywords: neural architecture distillation, differentiable architecture search, knowledge distillation, Pareto-optimal set, CNN architecture

Summary: 
The article introduces the Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation (DNAD) algorithm, which aims to create efficient neural networks by balancing performance and computational complexity. It combines two core algorithms, search by deleting and search by imitating, to derive optimal neural architectures. The Super-Network Progressive Shrinking (SNPS) algorithm, based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), is used to generate a diverse set of architectures with flexible structures. By integrating SNPS with Knowledge Distillation (KD), DNAD minimizes behavioral differences between the super-network and a teacher network, resulting in well-performing neural architectures. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that both SNPS and DNAD achieve lower error rates with fewer parameters and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to conventional methods. DNAD, in particular, outperforms most DARTS-based approaches by achieving a top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.

Summary:
AdaFisher is introduced as a novel adaptive second-order optimizer for training deep neural networks. By leveraging a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix, AdaFisher aims to improve convergence and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Compared to traditional second-order optimizers, AdaFisher demonstrates remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning, making it effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling. The code for AdaFisher is openly available on GitHub. Through experiments, AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, bridging the gap between improved convergence of second-order methods and the computational efficiency required for training DNNs. <div>
arXiv:2504.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, ex- hibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed. The code is available from https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AdaFisher.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores the interpretability of latent spaces produced by time series foundation models, focusing on their potential for visual analysis tasks. Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.

Summary:<br /> 
HyboWaveNet introduces a novel deep learning framework for predicting Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by combining hyperbolic graphical neural networks and multiscale graphical wavelet transform. By mapping protein features to Lorentz space to simulate hierarchical relationships among biomolecules, the framework captures complex biological interactions. It utilizes a graph neural network under the Lorentz model to generate node feature representations and multiple views for comparative learning. The integration of wavelet transforms allows for adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HyboWaveNet over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module in enhancing predictive performance and generalization. This work bridges geometric deep learning and signal processing to provide a principled approach for analyzing intricate biological systems.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental for deciphering cellular functions,disease pathways,and drug discovery.Although existing neural networks and machine learning methods have achieved high accuracy in PPI prediction,their black-box nature leads to a lack of causal interpretation of the prediction results and difficulty in capturing hierarchical geometries and multi-scale dynamic interaction patterns among proteins.To address these challenges, we propose HyboWaveNet,a novel deep learning framework that collaborates with hyperbolic graphical neural networks (HGNNs) and multiscale graphical wavelet transform for robust PPI prediction. Mapping protein features to Lorentz space simulates hierarchical topological relationships among biomolecules via a hyperbolic distance metric,enabling node feature representations that better fit biological a priori.HyboWaveNet inherently simulates hierarchical and scale-free biological relationships, while the integration of wavelet transforms enables adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across different resolutions. Our framework generates node feature representations via a graph neural network under the Lorenz model and generates pairs of positive samples under multiple different views for comparative learning, followed by further feature extraction via multi-scale graph wavelet transforms to predict potential PPIs. Experiments on public datasets show that HyboWaveNet improves over both existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate through ablation experimental studies that the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module improves the predictive performance and generalization ability of HyboWaveNet. This work links geometric deep learning and signal processing to advance PPI prediction, providing a principled approach for analyzing complex biological systems

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called Preference Vector to address the challenge of ensuring large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless. Existing approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) face limitations such as performance conflicts and poor controllability. The Preference Vector framework is inspired by task arithmetic and allows for separate training on individual preferences, enabling fine-grained user-controllable adjustments. This modular approach supports seamless integration of new preferences without the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, offers smooth control over preference trade-offs, and facilitates scalable multi-preference alignment. The framework provides a flexible and effective solution for balancing trade-offs in LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses the network capacity by transferring knowledge from a large (teacher) network to a smaller one (student). It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.

<div> surrogate modeling, AI-driven, geometric representation learning, self-supervised, physics-based simulations

Summary:<br />
AI-driven surrogate modeling is an effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design and analysis. Traditional surrogate models lack fine-scale geometric detail preservation, prompting the development of self-supervised geometric representation learning methods. This new approach decouples feature extraction from downstream tasks, using geometric reconstruction losses to guide a latent space embedding. Near-zero level sampling and a batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function enhance the encoding of intricate design features, enabling accurate physics predictions with minimal data. Case studies in structural mechanics demonstrate the method's ability to capture design features and facilitate accurate few-shot predictions, bridging the gap between geometric and physics-based representations in data-scarce scenarios. <div>

Abstract: AI-driven surrogate modeling has become an increasingly effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design, analysis, and manufacturing. These models leverage data-driven methods to predict physical quantities traditionally requiring computationally expensive simulations. However, the scarcity of labeled CAD-to-simulation datasets has driven recent advancements in self-supervised and foundation models, where geometric representation learning is performed offline and later fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. While these approaches have shown promise, their effectiveness is limited in applications requiring fine-scale geometric detail preservation. This work introduces a self-supervised geometric representation learning method designed to capture fine-scale geometric features from non-parametric 3D models. Unlike traditional end-to-end surrogate models, this approach decouples geometric feature extraction from downstream physics tasks, learning a latent space embedding guided by geometric reconstruction losses. Key elements include the essential use of near-zero level sampling and the innovative batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function, which enhance the encoding of intricate design features. The proposed method is validated through case studies in structural mechanics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing design features and enabling accurate few-shot physics predictions. Comparisons with traditional parametric surrogate modeling highlight its potential to bridge the gap between geometric and physics-based representations, providing an effective solution for surrogate modeling in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.

The paper introduces a benchmarking framework to evaluate transferability scores across various settings systematically. Despite the numerous methods proposed for measuring transferability, their reliability and practical usefulness remain inconclusive due to differences in experimental setups, datasets, and assumptions. The framework aims to standardize assessment protocols to provide more reliable measures for model selection in cross-domain applications. Through extensive experiments, variations in the performance of different metrics are observed under various scenarios, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation approach.

Abstract: Transferability scores aim to quantify how well a model trained on one domain generalizes to a target domain. Despite numerous methods proposed for measuring transferability, their reliability and practical usefulness remain inconclusive, often due to differing experimental setups, datasets, and assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate transferability scores across diverse settings. Through extensive experiments, we observe variations in how different metrics perform under various scenarios, suggesting that current evaluation practices may not fully capture each method's strengths and limitations. Our findings underscore the value of standardized assessment protocols, paving the way for more reliable transferability measures and better-informed model selection in cross-domain applications. Additionally, we achieved a 3.5\% improvement using our proposed metric for the head-training fine-tuning experimental setup.

Summary:
The article introduces the LZ penalty, designed to reduce degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without compromising performance. This penalty is based on codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. By decoding the LZ penalty, one can sample from the residual distribution after eliminating highly compressible information. It is shown that the LZ penalty allows state-of-the-art reasoning models to operate with greedy decoding without encountering degenerate repetitions. In comparison, both the frequency penalty and repetition penalty commonly used in the industry are found to be ineffective, resulting in degenerate repetition rates as high as 4%. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Summary: 
The paper examines the Causal Identification algorithm's use in causal time series graphs with latent confounders, spanning infinitely many time steps. The challenge lies in determining the identifiability of causal effects across time intervals, requiring consideration of graph segments of unlimited size. A novel bound is introduced, dependent on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any causal effect. The study reveals that analyzing a constant-size segment of the graph is sufficient to ascertain the identifiability of causal effects across unbounded time intervals. This advancement contributes valuable insights for decision-making in understanding causal relationships in complex time series data. <div>
arXiv:2504.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.

Summary:
ProFi-Net is introduced as a few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition, addressing challenges of limited data and sparse feature representations. It utilizes a prototype-based metric learning architecture with a feature-level attention mechanism to refine the Euclidean distance by emphasizing discriminative feature dimensions. A curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy is implemented exclusively on the query set, progressively introducing Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude to enhance generalization and robustness to overfitting.

Abstract: This paper presents ProFi-Net, a novel few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition that overcomes the chal- lenges of limited training data and sparse feature representations. ProFi- Net employs a prototype-based metric learning architecture enhanced with a feature-level attention mechanism, which dynamically refines the Euclidean distance by emphasizing the most discriminative feature di- mensions. Additionally, our approach introduces a curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy exclusively on the query set. By progressively incorporating Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude, the model is ex- posed to a broader range of challenging variations, thereby improving its generalization and robustness to overfitting.

<div> Keywords: large language models, logical reasoning, Boolean logic, proof construction, template transformation <br />
Summary: 
This paper investigates the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by testing their skills in constructing proofs in Boolean logic. The study focuses on training LLMs to generate proofs given a set of assumptions and a goal, with an automated proof checker to catch errors. To overcome the scarcity of real-world proofs, a randomized procedure for synthesizing valid proofs is proposed. The use of Template Transformation, a data augmentation technique, improves the model's ability to handle complex logical expressions. Experiment results show that LLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities for assertions with shorter proofs but struggle with more complex ones. Template transformation proves to be effective even for smaller models, highlighting its scalability across different model sizes. Overall, the study demonstrates that LLMs can learn to reason logically, albeit with varying degrees of success depending on proof complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). For a precisely defined yet tractable formulation, we choose the conceptually simple but technically complex task of constructing proofs in Boolean logic. A trained LLM receives as input a set of assumptions and a goal, and produces as output a proof that formally derives the goal from the assumptions. Incorrect proofs are caught by an automated proof checker. A critical obstacle for training is the scarcity of real-world proofs. We propose an efficient, randomized procedure for synthesizing valid proofs and introduce Template Transformation, a data augmentation technique that enhances the model's ability to handle complex logical expressions. The central evaluation question is whether an LLM has indeed learned to reason. We propose tests to measure the reasoning ability of a black-box LLM. By these measures, experiments demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for assertions with short proofs, which decline with proof complexity. Notably, template transformation improves accuracy even for smaller models, suggesting its effectiveness across model scales.

Summary:<br />
The Temporal Neural Operator (TNO) is introduced as an efficient neural operator for learning spatio-temporal dynamics in time-dependent PDEs. TNO addresses limitations of existing neural operators in capturing temporal dynamics, by incorporating a temporal branch into the DeepONet framework. It leverages various training strategies such as the Markov assumption, teacher forcing, and temporal bundling, while allowing conditioning on current or past states. TNO demonstrates long-range temporal extrapolation, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and the ability to handle multiple input functions through benchmarking and ablation studies on diverse example problems. This novel approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of neural operators in modeling temporal dynamics of PDEs, making them suitable for a wider range of applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) are machine learning models designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning to map between function spaces. Neural Operators such as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated excellent generalization properties when mapping between spatial function spaces. However, they struggle in mapping the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not explicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do not leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend to be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural operator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for time-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the DeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from several other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov assumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to condition the output on the current state or past states. Through extensive benchmarking and an ablation study on a diverse set of example problems we demonstrate the TNO long range temporal extrapolation capabilities, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and flexibility to handle multiple input functions.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Summary: 
Activation monitoring is crucial for language models due to their unpredictable and potentially unsafe behavior. Traditional linear probing methods can be enhanced by leveraging additional computation techniques such as prompted probing, sparse autoencoders, and zero-shot prompting. The study compares these methods and finds that prompted probing is most effective when inference-time compute is available, offering superior data efficiency and generalization performance. Zero-shot prompting can serve as a reasonable baseline, while sparse autoencoder-based methods outperform raw activation probing when compute is limited. Overall, the study recommends prompted probing for optimal monitoring of language model activations. <div>
arXiv:2504.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models can behave in unexpected and unsafe ways, and so it is valuable to monitor their outputs. Internal activations of language models encode additional information that could be useful for this. The baseline approach for activation monitoring is some variation of linear probing on a particular layer: starting from a labeled dataset, train a logistic regression classifier on that layer's activations. Recent work has proposed several approaches which may improve on naive linear probing, by leveraging additional computation. One class of techniques, which we call "prompted probing," leverages test time computation to improve monitoring by (1) prompting the model with a description of the monitoring task, and (2) applying a learned linear probe to resulting activations. Another class of techniques uses computation at train time: training sparse autoencoders offline to identify an interpretable basis for the activations, and e.g. max-pooling activations across tokens using that basis before applying a linear probe. However, one can also prompt the model with a description of the monitoring task and use its output directly. We develop and test novel refinements of these methods and compare them against each other. We find asking the model zero-shot is a reasonable baseline when inference-time compute is not limited; however, activation probing methods can substantially outperform this baseline given sufficient training data. Specifically, we recommend prompted probing when inference-time compute is available, due to its superior data efficiency and good generalization performance. Alternatively, if inference-time compute is limited, we find SAE-based probing methods outperform raw activation probing.

The allocation problem is framed as maximizing an ergodic utility function while adhering to Quality of Service (QoS) constraints.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed model training is crucial for modern machine learning applications, yet existing Federated Learning approaches struggle with heterogeneous data distributions and varying computational capabilities. Traditional solutions either treat all participants uniformly or require costly dynamic clustering during training, leading to reduced efficiency and delayed model specialization. We present FedCCL (Federated Clustered Continual Learning), a framework specifically designed for environments with static organizational characteristics but dynamic client availability. By combining static pre-training clustering with an adapted asynchronous FedAvg algorithm, FedCCL enables new clients to immediately profit from specialized models without prior exposure to their data distribution, while maintaining reduced coordination overhead and resilience to client disconnections. Our approach implements an asynchronous Federated Learning protocol with a three-tier model topology - global, cluster-specific, and local models - that efficiently manages knowledge sharing across heterogeneous participants. Evaluation using photovoltaic installations across central Europe demonstrates that FedCCL's location-based clustering achieves an energy prediction error of 3.93% (+-0.21%), while maintaining data privacy and showing that the framework maintains stability for population-independent deployments, with 0.14 percentage point degradation in performance for new installations. The results demonstrate that FedCCL offers an effective framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning, maintaining high accuracy and adaptability even with dynamic participant populations.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Traditional k-means clustering struggles with non-convex shapes and requires pre-specification of the number of clusters. A proposed geometric enhancement involves assigning radii to cluster centers after standard k-means and merging clusters with overlapping radii, allowing for flexibility in the number of clusters. This method can reconstruct non-convex shapes by meaningful merges with an overestimated k. The approach also supports recursive partitioning by independently clustering tiled regions of the feature space and globally merging them, enabling scalability and distribution. Implemented as a lightweight post-processing step on scikit-learn's k-means, the algorithm performs well on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy with minimal additional computation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional k-means clustering underperforms on non-convex shapes and requires the number of clusters k to be specified in advance. We propose a simple geometric enhancement: after standard k-means, each cluster center is assigned a radius (the distance to its farthest assigned point), and clusters whose radii overlap are merged. This post-processing step loosens the requirement for exact k: as long as k is overestimated (but not excessively), the method can often reconstruct non-convex shapes through meaningful merges. We also show that this approach supports recursive partitioning: clustering can be performed independently on tiled regions of the feature space, then globally merged, making the method scalable and suitable for distributed systems. Implemented as a lightweight post-processing step atop scikit-learn's k-means, the algorithm performs well on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy with minimal additional computation.

<div> Keywords: Digital twins, water distribution systems, Long Short-Term Memory networks, adversarial attacks, cybersecurity risks

Summary:
Digital twins are being used to optimize water distribution systems by utilizing real-time data and prediction models. A DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network incorporates LSTM networks for water consumption prediction. However, machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks like FGSM and PGD, which can manipulate model parameters and degrade forecasting accuracy. To enhance these vulnerabilities, a LA-based approach dynamically adjusts perturbations to make attacks harder to detect. Experimental results show a significant increase in prediction errors, with MAPE rising from 26% to over 35%. Adaptive attack strategies further amplify this impact, underscoring cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. This highlights the essential need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are improving water distribution systems by using real-time data, analytics, and prediction models to optimize operations. This paper presents a DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict water consumption. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%. Moreover, adaptive attack strategies amplify this effect, highlighting cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.

Summary:
FigBO is a new generalized acquisition function in Bayesian optimization that looks ahead to consider the future impact of candidate points on global information gain. It can be easily integrated with existing myopic acquisition functions. Theoretical analysis shows that FigBO has better regret bound and convergence rate compared to standard expected improvement (EI). Empirical experiments across various tasks demonstrate that FigBO achieves state-of-the-art performance and converges significantly faster than existing methods. The plug-and-play nature of FigBO makes it a promising addition to the field of Bayesian optimization. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, consisting of two main components: a surrogate model and an acquisition function. In recent years, myopic acquisition functions have been widely adopted for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, their lack of look-ahead capability limits their performance. To address this limitation, we propose FigBO, a generalized acquisition function that incorporates the future impact of candidate points on global information gain. FigBO is a plug-and-play method that can integrate seamlessly with most existing myopic acquisition functions. Theoretically, we analyze the regret bound and convergence rate of FigBO when combined with the myopic base acquisition function expected improvement (EI), comparing them to those of standard EI. Empirically, extensive experimental results across diverse tasks demonstrate that FigBO achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly faster convergence compared to existing methods.

<div> Detection, Mitigation, Adversarial Inputs, Machine Learning, Cryptography

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a theoretical study on the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs in Machine Learning algorithms during inference time. They define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM) through a 3-round protocol involving a trainer/defender and an attacker. The goal is to defend against inputs that deceive the training algorithm while maintaining performance on training data. The study shows that achieving DbD and DbM are equivalent for classification tasks but not for generative learning tasks due to multiple possible correct outputs. A separation between DbD and DbM is demonstrated in a generative learning task, where defense by mitigation is possible but defense by detection is not feasible under certain cryptographic assumptions. The mitigation phase successfully reduces the number of samples required compared to the initial training algorithm. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a cryptographically inspired theoretical study of detection versus mitigation of adversarial inputs produced by attackers of Machine Learning algorithms during inference time.
  We formally define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM). Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two resource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims to produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define correctness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful defense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the algorithm on inputs from the training distribution.
  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML classification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative learning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs that can be generated for each input. We show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting a generative learning task for which is possible to defend by mitigation but is provably impossible to defend by detection under the assumption that the Identity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and Strongly Unforgeable Signatures exist. The mitigation phase uses significantly fewer samples than the initial training algorithm.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by zeroth-order optimization (ZO) due to the high demand for Gaussian random numbers, making it infeasible for certain hardware platforms. The proposed solution, PeZO, addresses this issue by utilizing random number reuse strategies to reduce the need for random number generation and introducing an adaptive scaling method to replace the Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Experimental results show significant reductions in required resources for random number generation and power consumption without compromising training performance. This makes ZO optimization feasible for on-device training, presenting valuable insights for future research on enhancing the efficiency of deep neural network training on hardware platforms. <div>
arXiv:2504.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a hybrid Bayesian experimental design (BED) framework for optimizing data acquisition in the presence of model discrepancy. By utilizing auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman inversion (AD-EKI), the framework addresses the challenge of high-dimensional parameter space, enabling computationally efficient estimation of information gain. The AD-EKI allows for a differentiable evaluation of the utility function in BED, facilitating the use of gradient-based methods for design optimization. The proposed hybrid framework separates the inference of low-dimensional physical parameters from the high-dimensional model discrepancy, enabling the identification of optimal experimental designs for calibrating the model discrepancy. The method is demonstrated on a convection-diffusion example, showcasing its ability to efficiently calibrate the model discrepancy and infer unknown physical parameters. This approach not only addresses the issue of model discrepancy in BED but also has broader applications in bilevel optimization problems. <div>
arXiv:2504.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) offers a principled framework for optimizing data acquisition by leveraging probabilistic inference. However, practical implementations of BED are often compromised by model discrepancy, i.e., the mismatch between predictive models and true physical systems, which can potentially lead to biased parameter estimates. While data-driven approaches have been recently explored to characterize the model discrepancy, the resulting high-dimensional parameter space poses severe challenges for both Bayesian updating and design optimization. In this work, we propose a hybrid BED framework enabled by auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman inversion (AD-EKI) that addresses these challenges by providing a computationally efficient, gradient-free alternative to estimate the information gain for high-dimensional network parameters. The AD-EKI allows a differentiable evaluation of the utility function in BED and thus facilitates the use of standard gradient-based methods for design optimization. In the proposed hybrid framework, we iteratively optimize experimental designs, decoupling the inference of low-dimensional physical parameters handled by standard BED methods, from the high-dimensional model discrepancy handled by AD-EKI. The identified optimal designs for the model discrepancy enable us to systematically collect informative data for its calibration. The performance of the proposed method is studied by a classical convection-diffusion BED example, and the hybrid framework enabled by AD-EKI efficiently identifies informative data to calibrate the model discrepancy and robustly infers the unknown physical parameters in the modeled system. Besides addressing the challenges of BED with model discrepancy, AD-EKI also potentially fosters efficient and scalable frameworks in many other areas with bilevel optimization, such as meta-learning and structure optimization.

<div> slow manifolds, model reduction, multiscale algorithms, conditional score-based generative models, bifurcation diagrams
Summary: 
This article discusses the use of conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) in sampling slow manifolds and steady states in dynamical systems with time scale separation. By employing cSGMs, researchers can efficiently initialize on low-dimensional slow manifolds and approximate steady states in bifurcation diagrams based on desired parameters. This approach can aid in understanding the geometry of reduced slow manifolds and filling in missing segments of steady states in bifurcation diagrams. The framework presented in this work integrates machine learning techniques with traditional numerical nonlinear dynamics methods, enhancing the capability to explore system attractors and model reduction. <div>
arXiv:2504.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit.
  In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.

Additionally, the framework maximizes the Schatten p-norm of labels to maintain class balance during clustering, supported by a theoretical proof.

arXiv:2504.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold clustering, with its exceptional ability to capture complex data structures, holds a pivotal position in cluster analysis. However, existing methods often focus only on finding the optimal combination between K-means and manifold learning, and overlooking the consistency between the data structure and labels. To address this issue, we deeply explore the relationship between K-means and manifold learning, and on this basis, fuse them to develop a new clustering framework. Specifically, the algorithm uses labels to guide the manifold structure and perform clustering on it, which ensures the consistency between the data structure and labels. Furthermore, in order to naturally maintain the class balance in the clustering process, we maximize the Schatten p-norm of labels, and provide a theoretical proof to support this. Additionally, our clustering framework is designed to be flexible and compatible with many types of distance functions, which facilitates efficient processing of nonlinear separable data. The experimental results of several databases confirm the superiority of our proposed model.

arXiv:2504.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental model in kinetic theory, describes the evolution of particle distribution functions through a nonlinear, high-dimensional collision operator. However, its numerical solution remains computationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and high-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural Spectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the Fourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision operator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves resolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling accurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical validation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator converges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We evaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and hard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The results demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral solvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving the Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using diffusion models with an asynchronous noise schedule. At each step of the diffusion process, the noise schedule injects noise of varying scales into different parts of the data. With a careful design of the noise schedules, earlier events are generated faster than later ones, thus providing stronger conditioning for forecasting the more distant future. We derive an objective to effectively train these models for a general family of noise schedules based on conditional flow matching. Our method models the joint distribution of the latent representations of events in a sequence and achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting both the next inter-event time and event type on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it flexibly accommodates varying lengths of observation and prediction windows in different forecasting settings by adjusting the starting and ending points of the generation process. Finally, our method shows superior performance in long-horizon prediction tasks, outperforming existing baseline methods.

Summary: 
Homophily is an essential measure in understanding graph neural networks (GNNs), but its analysis has been limited to static graphs. This study explores homophily in dynamic settings and introduces dynamic homophily as a new measure. The discriminative performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in dynamic settings is linked to the probability of a node's future label matching its neighbors' current labels. By examining various dynamic node classification datasets, it is found that popular GNNs are not resilient to low dynamic homophily. The research offers insights on enhancing GNN design for dynamic graphs, shedding light on the importance of homophily in GNN performance in dynamic node classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Homophily, as a measure, has been critical to increasing our understanding of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, to date this measure has only been analyzed in the context of static graphs. In our work, we explore homophily in dynamic settings. Focusing on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we demonstrate theoretically that in dynamic settings, current GCN discriminative performance is characterized by the probability that a node's future label is the same as its neighbors' current labels. Based on this insight, we propose dynamic homophily, a new measure of homophily that applies in the dynamic setting. This new measure correlates with GNN discriminative performance and sheds light on how to potentially design more powerful GNNs for dynamic graphs. Leveraging a variety of dynamic node classification datasets, we demonstrate that popular GNNs are not robust to low dynamic homophily. Going forward, our work represents an important step towards understanding homophily and GNN performance in dynamic node classification.

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that current graph positional encodings (PEs) are not beneficial and could potentially hurt performance in tasks involving heterophilous graphs, where nodes that are close tend to have different labels. This limitation is critical as many real-world networks exhibit heterophily, and even highly homophilous graphs can contain local regions of strong heterophily. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable Laplacian Positional Encodings (LLPE), a new PE that leverages the full spectrum of the graph Laplacian, enabling them to capture graph structure on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. Theoretically, we prove LLPE's ability to approximate a general class of graph distances and demonstrate its generalization properties. Empirically, our evaluation on 12 benchmarks demonstrates that LLPE improves accuracy across a variety of GNNs, including graph transformers, by up to 35% and 14% on synthetic and real-world graphs, respectively. Going forward, our work represents a significant step towards developing PEs that effectively capture complex structures in heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation but face significant memory bottlenecks during training. GaLore, Gradient Low-Rank Projection, addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent low-rank structure of weight gradients, enabling substantial memory savings without sacrificing performance. Recent works further extend GaLore from various aspects, including low-bit quantization and higher-order tensor structures. However, there are several remaining challenges for GaLore, such as the computational overhead of SVD for subspace updates and the integration with state-of-the-art training parallelization strategies (e.g., FSDP). In this paper, we present GaLore 2, an efficient and scalable GaLore framework that addresses these challenges and incorporates recent advancements. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of GaLore 2 by pre-training Llama 7B from scratch using up to 500 billion training tokens, highlighting its potential impact on real LLM pre-training scenarios.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN-LSTM hybrid framework to enhance the accuracy of precipitation forecasts, focusing on Pune, Maharashtra, India, from 1972 to 2002. The dataset covers monthly mean precipitation data and the model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies in the time series data. Results show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over traditional methods, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752. However, the model requires high computational resources for large-scale datasets and needs further enhancement for predicting multidimensional precipitation data.

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of weather indicators is of great significance in disaster prevention and mitigation, agricultural production, and transportation. Precipitation, as one of the key meteorological indicators, plays a crucial role in water resource management, agricultural production, and urban flood control. This study proposes a multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN- LSTM hybrid framework, aiming to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. The dataset is sourced from Pune, Maharashtra, India, covering monthly mean precipitation data from 1972 to 2002. This dataset includes nearly 31 years (1972-2002) of monthly average precipitation, reflecting the long-term fluctuations and seasonal variations of precipitation in the region. By analyzing these time series data, the CNN-LSTM model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752, which demonstrates a significant advantage over traditional time series prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Furthermore, this study provides new research ideas for precipitation prediction. However, the model requires high computational resources when dealing with large-scale datasets, and its predictive ability for multidimensional precipitation data still needs improvement. Future research could extend the model to support and predict multidimensional precipitation data, thereby promoting the development of more accurate and efficient meteorological prediction technologies.

Summary:
Intelligent fault-tolerant (FT) computing is crucial for reliable service delivery. Existing deep learning-based FT algorithms face challenges due to the complexity of fault knowledge and time series log data. In response, FT-MoE, a sustainable-learning mixture-of-experts model, is proposed. It leverages decoder-based transformer models to extract fault prototype vectors and utilizes dual mixture of experts networks for accurate fault prediction. A two-stage optimization scheme enables offline training and online tuning to adapt to dynamic service environments.

Abstract: Intelligent fault-tolerant (FT) computing has recently demonstrated significant advantages of predicting and diagnosing faults in advance, enabling reliable service delivery. However, due to heterogeneity of fault knowledge and complex dependence relationships of time series log data, existing deep learning-based FT algorithms further improve detection performance relying on single neural network model with difficulty. To this end, we propose FT-MoE, a sustainable-learning mixture-of-experts model for fault-tolerant computing with multiple tasks, which enables different parameters learning distinct fault knowledge to achieve high-reliability for service system. Firstly, we use decoder-based transformer models to obtain fault prototype vectors of decoupling long-distance dependencies. Followed by, we present a dual mixture of experts networks for high-accurate prediction for both fault detection and classification tasks. Then, we design a two-stage optimization scheme of offline training and online tuning, which allows that in operation FT-MoE can also keep learning to adapt to dynamic service environments. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of FT-MoE, we conduct extensive experiments on the FT benchmark. Experimental results show that FT-MoE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available upon publication.

<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the challenge of sampling tokens in arbitrary-order language models. It introduces Any-Subset Autoregressive Models (AS-ARMs) that allow for generating tokens in any order and in parallel. These models support parallelized joint probability density estimation through the Any-Subset Speculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm, enabling correction of parallel-generated token distributions. ASSD ensures generation of tokens from the correct joint distribution with a limited number of neural network calls. Empirical results showcase that AS-ARMs speed up language generation while maintaining quality. A mathematically justified training scheme is provided for AS-ARMs, leading to state-of-the-art performance on infilling tasks and competitive results on code generation tasks. The findings highlight AS-ARMs as a promising area in language modeling, offering efficient and effective token generation in complex language tasks. <div>
arXiv:2504.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arbitrary-order language models, it is an open question how to sample tokens in parallel from the correct joint distribution. With discrete diffusion models, the more tokens they generate in parallel, the less their predicted distributions adhere to the originally learned data distribution, as they rely on a conditional independence assumption that only works with infinitesimally small timesteps. We find that a different class of models, any-subset autoregressive models (AS-ARMs), holds the solution. As implied by the name, AS-ARMs can generate tokens in any order, and in parallel. Moreover, AS-ARMs support parallelized joint probability density estimation, allowing them to correct their own parallel-generated token distributions, via our Any-Subset Speculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm. ASSD provably enables generation of tokens from the correct joint distribution, with the number of neural network calls upper bounded by the number of tokens predicted. We empirically verify that ASSD speeds up language generation, without sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we provide a mathematically justified scheme for training AS-ARMs for generation, and show that AS-ARMs achieve state-of-the-art performance among sub-200M parameter models on infilling benchmark tasks, and nearly match the performance of models 50X larger on code generation. Our theoretical and empirical results indicate that the once-forgotten AS-ARMs are a promising direction of language modeling.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation has been widely used in marketing optimization. The framework of an uplift model followed by a constrained optimization algorithm is popular in practice. To enhance performance in the online environment, the framework needs to be improved to address the complexities caused by temporal dataset shift. This paper focuses on capturing the dataset shift from user behavior and domain distribution changing over time. We propose an Incremental Causal Effect with Proxy Knowledge Distillation (ICE-PKD) framework to tackle this challenge. The ICE-PKD framework includes two components: (i) a multi-treatment uplift network that eliminates confounding bias using counterfactual regression; (ii) an incremental training strategy that adapts to the temporal dataset shift by updating with the latest data and protects generalization via replay-based knowledge distillation. We also revisit the uplift modeling metrics and introduce a novel metric for more precise online evaluation in multiple treatment scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and online datasets show that the proposed framework achieves better performance. The ICE-PKD framework has been deployed in the marketing system of Huaxiaozhu, a ride-hailing platform in China.

Summary:
Group Relative Knowledge Distillation (GRKD) proposes a novel framework for transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model by focusing on relative ranking among classes rather than absolute probabilities. By introducing a group relative loss that preserves pairwise preference orderings provided by the teacher's outputs, GRKD aims to capture valuable relational inductive biases embedded in the teacher's predictions. The method outperforms existing distillation approaches in terms of generalization, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained class differentiation. By emphasizing the relational structure of teacher knowledge rather than absolute likelihood, GRKD offers a new perspective on knowledge transfer in distillation techniques. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model by minimizing differences between their output distributions. However, existing distillation approaches largely focus on mimicking absolute probabilities and neglect the valuable relational inductive biases embedded in the teacher's relative predictions, leading to exposure bias. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Knowledge Distillation (GRKD), a novel framework that distills teacher knowledge by learning the relative ranking among classes, rather than directly fitting the absolute distribution. Specifically, we introduce a group relative loss that encourages the student model to preserve the pairwise preference orderings provided by the teacher's outputs. Extensive experiments on classification benchmarks demonstrate that GRKD achieves superior generalization compared to existing methods, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained class differentiation. Our method provides a new perspective on exploiting teacher knowledge, focusing on relational structure rather than absolute likelihood.

Summary:
The study evaluates a machine-learning method for segmenting and classifying symbolic representations of folk songs into tune families using Haar-wavelet filtering. Melodies are represented as discrete pitch-time signals, and the continuous wavelet transform with the Haar wavelet is applied to filter melodies at specific time scales. Wavelet coefficients' local maxima are used to indicate boundaries for segmentation, and k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics are employed for classification. The results of the wavelet-based method are compared to a Gestalt-based method and direct application of metrics to the pitch signal. The study finds that wavelet-based segmentation and filtering lead to improved classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation, especially when optimizing time-scale and other parameters. This highlights the effectiveness of using wavelet filtering in machine-learning methods for analyzing folk songs.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate a machine-learning method in which symbolic representations of folk songs are segmented and classified into tune families with Haar-wavelet filtering. The method is compared with previously proposed Gestalt-based method. Melodies are represented as discrete symbolic pitch-time signals. We apply the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Haar wavelet at specific scales, obtaining filtered versions of melodies emphasizing their information at particular time-scales. We use the filtered signal for representation and segmentation, using the wavelet coefficients' local maxima to indicate local boundaries and classify segments by means of k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics (Euclidean, cityblock), and compare the results to a Gestalt-based segmentation method and metrics applied directly to the pitch signal. We found that the wavelet based segmentation and wavelet-filtering of the pitch signal lead to better classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation when the time-scale and other parameters are optimized.

<div> Keywords: DeeP-Mod, Deep Dynamic Programming Network, Deep Q-Network, Dynamic Programming, Environment Model 

Summary:
The DeeP-Mod framework utilizes features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN) to build an environment model for decision-making. Unlike traditional Deep Q-Learning methods, DeeP-Mod ensures that state information is preserved by using Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques in training the DDPN. This approach allows for the extraction of state values rather than state-action pairs, leading to improved task and action set independence. Furthermore, a reduced version of the DDPN can be trained using features from the original DDPN, achieving faster convergence and outperforming the original model, particularly in noisy environments. The DeeP-Mod framework eliminates the need for an externally defined environment model, making it applicable to a wide range of environments. By learning directly from the evolutionary features of the DDPN, DeeP-Mod enables the training of an effective feature-value representation for optimal policy learning. <div>

Abstract: The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.

Summary: 
Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned classes. Existing methods often struggle to maintain a balance between old and new knowledge in a continually updated model. The proposed method, Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), addresses this challenge by introducing a dual classifier approach for inclusive training separation. This allows for effective integration of knowledge from both old and new classes, enhancing plasticity and stability. BOIL outperforms state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods, demonstrating more balanced and improved performance. Extensive experimental evaluations across three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of BOIL in achieving a well-balanced learner in OCIL settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing uses radio-frequency signals from Wi-Fi devices to analyze environments, enabling tasks such as tracking people, detecting intrusions, and recognizing gestures. The rise of this technology is driven by the IEEE 802.11bf standard and growing demand for tools that can ensure privacy and operate through obstacles. However, the performance of Wi-Fi sensing is heavily influenced by environmental conditions, especially when extracting spatial and temporal features from the surrounding scene. A key challenge is achieving robust generalization across domains, ensuring stable performance even when the sensing environment changes significantly. This paper introduces a novel deep learning model for cross-domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals, inspired by physical signal shielding. The model uses a Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures for both the generator and discriminator. To simulate physical shielding, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was constructed, mimicking a Faraday cage. Wi-Fi signal spectra were collected from various materials both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the box to train the model. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained on domain-free spectra and tested on signals denoised by the RaGAN. The system achieved 96% accuracy and demonstrated strong material discrimination capabilities, offering potential for use in security applications to identify concealed objects based on their composition.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards using one training example (1-shot RLVR) proves effective in enhancing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The application of RLVR to model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Various models, RL algorithms, and math examples show substantial performance enhancements using 1-shot RLVR. Interesting phenomena such as cross-domain generalization, increased self-reflection, and post-saturation generalization are observed during training. The effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR is primarily attributed to the policy gradient loss and promoting exploration. Additionally, applying entropy loss alone enhances model performance significantly. These findings can inspire future research on RLVR data efficiency and prompt a re-evaluation of progress and underlying mechanisms in RLVR. The code, model, and data are open source for further exploration.

arXiv:2504.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model, and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR

<div> neural architectures, treatment effects, observational data, hidden confounding, covariate mismatch <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces neural architectures to estimate treatment effects from observational data, addressing challenges such as hidden confounding and covariate mismatch. Traditional techniques rely on causal graphs for hidden confounding and methods like covariate matching for covariate mismatch, but a unified framework is lacking. The proposed neural architectures aim to learn a representation of pre-treatment covariates that serves as a valid adjustment while satisfying covariate matching constraints. By combining gradient matching with a covariate matching transformation, the models generate approximately invariant representations that yield valid adjustment sets, providing an interval around the true causal effect. This method outperforms various baselines on causal benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effects (PEHE) on datasets including IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and a Crowd Management dataset based on images. <div>
arXiv:2504.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects from observational data is challenging due to two main reasons: (a) hidden confounding, and (b) covariate mismatch (control and treatment groups not having identical distributions). Long lines of works exist that address only either of these issues. To address the former, conventional techniques that require detailed knowledge in the form of causal graphs have been proposed. For the latter, covariate matching and importance weighting methods have been used. Recently, there has been progress in combining testable independencies with partial side information for tackling hidden confounding. A common framework to address both hidden confounding and selection bias is missing. We propose neural architectures that aim to learn a representation of pre-treatment covariates that is a valid adjustment and also satisfies covariate matching constraints. We combine two different neural architectures: one based on gradient matching across domains created by subsampling a suitable anchor variable that assumes causal side information, followed by the other, a covariate matching transformation. We prove that approximately invariant representations yield approximate valid adjustment sets which would enable an interval around the true causal effect. In contrast to usual sensitivity analysis, where an unknown nuisance parameter is varied, we have a testable approximation yielding a bound on the effect estimate. We also outperform various baselines with respect to ATE and PEHE errors on causal benchmarks that include IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and an image-based Crowd Management dataset.

Abstract: Performative Reinforcement Learning (PRL) refers to a scenario in which the deployed policy changes the reward and transition dynamics of the underlying environment. In this work, we study multi-agent PRL by incorporating performative effects into Markov Potential Games (MPGs). We introduce the notion of a performatively stable equilibrium (PSE) and show that it always exists under a reasonable sensitivity assumption. We then provide convergence results for state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve MPGs. Specifically, we show that independent policy gradient ascent (IPGA) and independent natural policy gradient (INPG) converge to an approximate PSE in the best-iterate sense, with an additional term that accounts for the performative effects. Furthermore, we show that INPG asymptotically converges to a PSE in the last-iterate sense. As the performative effects vanish, we recover the convergence rates from prior work. For a special case of our game, we provide finite-time last-iterate convergence results for a repeated retraining approach, in which agents independently optimize a surrogate objective. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Ensuring the generalisability of clinical machine learning (ML) models across diverse healthcare settings remains a significant challenge due to variability in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and institutional practices. Existing model evaluation approaches often rely on real-world datasets, which are limited in availability, embed confounding biases, and lack the flexibility needed for systematic experimentation. Furthermore, while generative models aim for statistical realism, they often lack transparency and explicit control over factors driving distributional shifts. In this work, we propose a novel structured synthetic data framework designed for the controlled benchmarking of model robustness, fairness, and generalisability. Unlike approaches focused solely on mimicking observed data, our framework provides explicit control over the data generating process, including site-specific prevalence variations, hierarchical subgroup effects, and structured feature interactions. This enables targeted investigation into how models respond to specific distributional shifts and potential biases. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the framework's ability to isolate the impact of site variations, support fairness-aware audits, and reveal generalisation failures, particularly highlighting how model complexity interacts with site-specific effects. This work contributes a reproducible, interpretable, and configurable tool designed to advance the reliable deployment of ML in clinical settings.

Abstract: Data-driven decision support tools play an increasingly central role in decision-making across various domains. In this work, we focus on binary classification models for predicting positive-outcome scores and deciding on resource allocation, e.g., credit scores for granting loans or churn propensity scores for targeting customers with a retention campaign. Such models may exhibit discriminatory behavior toward specific demographic groups through their predicted scores, potentially leading to unfair resource allocation. We focus on demographic parity as a fairness metric to compare the proportions of instances that are selected based on their positive outcome scores across groups. In this work, we propose a decision-centric fairness methodology that induces fairness only within the decision-making region -- the range of relevant decision thresholds on the score that may be used to decide on resource allocation -- as an alternative to a global fairness approach that seeks to enforce parity across the entire score distribution. By restricting the induction of fairness to the decision-making region, the proposed decision-centric approach avoids imposing overly restrictive constraints on the model, which may unnecessarily degrade the quality of the predicted scores. We empirically compare our approach to a global fairness approach on multiple (semi-synthetic) datasets to identify scenarios in which focusing on fairness where it truly matters, i.e., decision-centric fairness, proves beneficial.

<title>Combatting Dimensional Collapse in LLM Pre-Training Data via Diversified File Selection</title>

Abstract: Selecting high-quality pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their overall performance under limited computation budget, improving both training and sample efficiency. Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in SlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training budget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.

Abstract: Rules offer an invaluable combination of predictive and descriptive capabilities. Our package for rule-based data analysis, RuleKit, has proven its effectiveness in classification, regression, and survival problems. Here we present its second version. New algorithms and optimized implementations of those previously included, significantly improved the computational performance of our suite, reducing the analysis time of some data sets by two orders of magnitude. The usability of RuleKit 2 is provided by two new components: Python package and browser application with a graphical user interface. The former complies with scikit-learn, the most popular data mining library for Python, allowing RuleKit 2 to be straightforwardly integrated into existing data analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows multiple devices or institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data with a third-party. FL is considered a promising way to address patient privacy concerns in medical artificial intelligence. The ethical risks of medical FL systems themselves, however, have thus far been underexamined. This paper aims to address this gap. We argue that medical FL presents a new variety of opacity -- federation opacity -- that, in turn, generates a distinctive double black box problem in healthcare AI. We highlight several instances in which the anticipated benefits of medical FL may be exaggerated, and conclude by highlighting key challenges that must be overcome to make FL ethically feasible in medicine.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional message-passing graph neural networks in many studies, especially in processing graph data with long-range dependencies. However, GTs tend to suffer from weak inductive bias, overfitting and over-globalizing problems due to the dense attention. In this paper, we introduce SFi-attention, a novel attention mechanism designed to learn sparse pattern by minimizing an energy function based on network flows with l1-norm regularization, to relieve those issues caused by dense attention. Furthermore, SFi-Former is accordingly devised which can leverage the sparse attention pattern of SFi-attention to generate sparse network flows beyond adjacency matrix of graph data. Specifically, SFi-Former aggregates features selectively from other nodes through flexible adaptation of the sparse attention, leading to a more robust model. We validate our SFi-Former on various graph datasets, especially those graph data exhibiting long-range dependencies. Experimental results show that our SFi-Former obtains competitive performance on GNN Benchmark datasets and SOTA performance on LongRange Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets. Additionally, our model gives rise to smaller generalization gaps, which indicates that it is less prone to over-fitting. Click here for codes.

<title>Explanations Go Linear: Interpretable and Individual Latent Encoding for Post-hoc Explainability</title>

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability is essential for understanding black-box machine learning models. Surrogate-based techniques are widely used for local and global model-agnostic explanations but have significant limitations. Local surrogates capture non-linearities but are computationally expensive and sensitive to parameters, while global surrogates are more efficient but struggle with complex local behaviors. In this paper, we present ILLUME, a flexible and interpretable framework grounded in representation learning, that can be integrated with various surrogate models to provide explanations for any black-box classifier. Specifically, our approach combines a globally trained surrogate with instance-specific linear transformations learned with a meta-encoder to generate both local and global explanations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ILLUME in producing feature attributions and decision rules that are not only accurate but also robust and faithful to the black-box, thus providing a unified explanation framework that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional surrogate methods.

<title>What's Wrong with Your Synthetic Tabular Data? Using Explainable AI to Evaluate Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Evaluating synthetic tabular data is challenging, since they can differ from the real data in so many ways. There exist numerous metrics of synthetic data quality, ranging from statistical distances to predictive performance, often providing conflicting results. Moreover, they fail to explain or pinpoint the specific weaknesses in the synthetic data. To address this, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a binary detection classifier trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. While the classifier identifies distributional differences, XAI concepts such as feature importance and feature effects, analyzed through methods like permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, Shapley values and counterfactual explanations, reveal why synthetic data are distinguishable, highlighting inconsistencies, unrealistic dependencies, or missing patterns. This interpretability increases transparency in synthetic data evaluation and provides deeper insights beyond conventional metrics, helping diagnose and improve synthetic data quality. We apply our approach to two tabular datasets and generative models, showing that it uncovers issues overlooked by standard evaluation techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we study unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that learn a neural network representation, i.e. regular patterns of normal data, which anomalies are deviating from. Inspired by a similar concept in engineering, we refer to our methodology as surrogate anomaly detection. We formalize the concept of surrogate anomaly detection into a set of axioms required for optimal surrogate models and propose a new algorithm, named DEAN (Deep Ensemble ANomaly detection), designed to fulfill these criteria. We evaluate DEAN on 121 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against 19 existing methods, as well as the scalability and reliability of our method.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are integral to intelligent transportation systems, enabling vehicles to offload computational tasks to nearby roadside units (RSUs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers for real-time processing. However, the highly dynamic nature of VANETs introduces challenges, such as unpredictable network conditions, high latency, energy inefficiency, and task failure. This research addresses these issues by proposing a hybrid AI framework that integrates supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for intelligent task offloading and resource allocation. The framework leverages supervised models for predicting optimal offloading strategies, reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making, and PSO for optimizing latency and energy consumption. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in latency and energy usage while improving task success rates and network throughput. By offering an efficient, and scalable solution, this framework sets the foundation for enhancing real-time applications in dynamic vehicular environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models form an important class of generative models today, accounting for much of the state of the art in cutting edge AI research. While numerous extensions beyond image and video generation exist, few of such approaches address the issue of explicit constraints in the samples generated. In this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a variant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while guaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded adjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform classifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred edges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results show that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not explicitly account for path constraints.

Abstract: The discovery of new molecules based on the original chemical molecule distributions is of great importance in medicine. The graph transformer, with its advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional graph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of graph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to effectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage only sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of molecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based framework for molecular generation, which we call \textbf{JTreeformer} as it transforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN parallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed acyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can iteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the partially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a diffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical results demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule generation methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).

Abstract: Identifying molecular properties, including side effects, is a critical yet time-consuming step in drug development. Failing to detect these side effects before regulatory submission can result in significant financial losses and production delays, and overlooking them during the regulatory review can lead to catastrophic consequences. This challenge presents an opportunity for innovative machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid quantum-classical models like the Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM) network. The QK-LSTM integrates quantum kernel functions into the classical LSTM framework, enabling the capture of complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data. By mapping input data into a high-dimensional quantum feature space, the QK-LSTM model reduces the need for large parameter sets, allowing for model compression without sacrificing accuracy in sequence-based tasks. Recent advancements have been made in the classical domain using augmented variations of the Simplified Molecular Line-Entry System (SMILES). However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has explored the impact of augmented SMILES in the quantum domain, nor the role of augmented Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) in either classical or hybrid quantum-classical settings. This study presents the first analysis of these approaches, providing novel insights into their potential for enhancing molecular property prediction and side effect identification. Results reveal that augmenting SELFIES yields in statistically significant improvements from SMILES by a 5.97% improvement for the classical domain and a 5.91% improvement for the hybrid quantum-classical domain.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds great potential for solving socially relevant and computationally complex problems. Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML) promises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by limitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full capabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious task, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.

<title>The When and How of Target Variable Transformations</title>

Abstract: The machine learning pipeline typically involves the iterative process of (1) collecting the data, (2) preparing the data, (3) learning a model, and (4) evaluating a model. Practitioners recognize the importance of the data preparation phase in terms of its impact on the ability to learn accurate models. In this regard, significant attention is often paid to manipulating the feature set (e.g., selection, transformations, dimensionality reduction). A point that is less well appreciated is that transformations on the target variable can also have a large impact on whether it is possible to learn a suitable model. These transformations may include accounting for subject-specific biases (e.g., in how someone uses a rating scale), contexts (e.g., population size effects), and general trends (e.g., inflation). However, this point has received a much more cursory treatment in the existing literature. The goal of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to highlight the importance of this problem by showing when transforming the target variable has been useful in practice. Second, we will provide a set of generic ``rules of thumb'' that indicate situations when transforming the target variable may be needed. Third, we will discuss which transformations should be considered in a given situation.

Abstract: We present a novel method of classification and segmentation of melodies in symbolic representation. The method is based on filtering pitch as a signal over time with the Haar-wavelet, and we evaluate it on two tasks. The filtered signal corresponds to a single-scale signal ws from the continuous Haar wavelet transform. The melodies are first segmented using local maxima or zero-crossings of w_s. The segments of w_s are then classified using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm with Euclidian and city-block distances. The method proves more effective than using unfiltered pitch signals and Gestalt-based segmentation when used to recognize the parent works of segments from Bach's Two-Part Inventions (BWV 772-786). When used to classify 360 Dutch folk tunes into 26 tune families, the performance of the method is comparable to the use of pitch signals, but not as good as that of string-matching methods based on multiple features.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.

Abstract: We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks. However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Learning approaches is often based and demonstrated on large public datasets. However, when applying such approaches to internal, private datasets, one frequently faces challenges arising from structural differences in the datasets, domain shift, and the lack of labels. In this work, we introduce Tabular Data Adapters (TDA), a novel method for generating soft labels for unlabeled tabular data in outlier detection tasks. By identifying statistically similar public datasets and transforming private data (based on a shared autoencoder) into a format compatible with state-of-the-art public models, our approach enables the generation of weak labels. It thereby can help to mitigate the cold start problem of labeling by basing on existing outlier detection models for public datasets. In experiments on 50 tabular datasets across different domains, we demonstrate that our method is able to provide more accurate annotations than baseline approaches while reducing computational time. Our approach offers a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution, to bridge the gap between public research models and real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been widely utilized to solve graph-related tasks because of their strong learning power in utilizing the local information of neighbors. However, recent studies on graph adversarial attacks have proven that current graph neural networks are not robust against malicious attacks. Yet much of the existing work has focused on the optimization objective based on attack performance to obtain (near) optimal perturbations, but paid less attention to the strength quantification of each perturbation such as the injection of a particular node/link, which makes the choice of perturbations a black-box model that lacks interpretability. In this work, we propose the concept of noise to quantify the attack strength of each adversarial link. Furthermore, we propose three attack strategies based on the defined noise and classification margins in terms of single and multiple steps optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets against three representative graph neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies. Particularly, we also investigate the preferred patterns of effective adversarial perturbations by analyzing the corresponding properties of the selected perturbation nodes.

Abstract: When optimising for conditional value at risk (CVaR) using policy gradients (PG), current meth- ods rely on discarding a large proportion of tra- jectories, resulting in poor sample efficiency. We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajecto- ries used in training, rather than simply discard- ing them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately. We show, with empirical results in an number of environments, that this reformulation of the prob- lem results in consistently improved performance compared to baselines.

<title>Does Feedback Help in Bandits with Arm Erasures?</title>

Abstract: We study a distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem over arm erasure channels, motivated by the increasing adoption of MAB algorithms over communication-constrained networks. In this setup, the learner communicates the chosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability $\epsilon \in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the last successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the arm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey feedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm played is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper, we instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner on whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows which arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not improve the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied no-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and $T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler algorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order) regret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance numerically.

<title>Evaluating Generative Models for Tabular Data: Novel Metrics and Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Generative models have revolutionized multiple domains, yet their application to tabular data remains underexplored. Evaluating generative models for tabular data presents unique challenges due to structural complexity, large-scale variability, and mixed data types, making it difficult to intuitively capture intricate patterns. Existing evaluation metrics offer only partial insights, lacking a comprehensive measure of generative performance. To address this limitation, we propose three novel evaluation metrics: FAED, FPCAD, and RFIS. Our extensive experimental analysis, conducted on three standard network intrusion detection datasets, compares these metrics with established evaluation methods such as Fidelity, Utility, TSTR, and TRTS. Our results demonstrate that FAED effectively captures generative modeling issues overlooked by existing metrics. While FPCAD exhibits promising performance, further refinements are necessary to enhance its reliability. Our proposed framework provides a robust and practical approach for assessing generative models in tabular data applications.

<title>MOSIC: Model-Agnostic Optimal Subgroup Identification with Multi-Constraint for Improved Reliability</title>

Abstract: Identifying subgroups that benefit from specific treatments using observational data is a critical challenge in personalized medicine. Most existing approaches solely focus on identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. However, practical considerations, such as ensuring a minimum subgroup size for representativeness or achieving sufficient confounder balance for reliability, are also important for making findings clinically meaningful and actionable. While some studies address these constraints individually, none offer a unified approach to handle them simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework for optimal subgroup identification under multiple constraints. We reformulate this combinatorial problem as an unconstrained min-max optimization problem with novel modifications and solve it by a gradient descent ascent algorithm. We further prove its convergence to a feasible and locally optimal solution. Our method is stable and highly flexible, supporting various models and techniques for estimating and optimizing treatment effectiveness with observational data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying subgroups that satisfy multiple constraints, achieving higher treatment effects and better confounder balancing results across different group sizes.

<title>Statistical and Predictive Analysis to Identify Risk Factors and Effects of Post COVID-19 Syndrome</title>

Abstract: Based on recent studies, some COVID-19 symptoms can persist for months after infection, leading to what is termed long COVID. Factors such as vaccination timing, patient characteristics, and symptoms during the acute phase of infection may contribute to the prolonged effects and intensity of long COVID. Each patient, based on their unique combination of factors, develops a specific risk or intensity of long COVID. In this work, we aim to achieve two objectives: (1) conduct a statistical analysis to identify relationships between various factors and long COVID, and (2) perform predictive analysis of long COVID intensity using these factors. We benchmark and interpret various data-driven approaches, including linear models, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, using data from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. Our results show that Neural Networks (NN) achieve the best performance in terms of MAPE, with predictions averaging 19\% error. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals key factors such as loss of smell, headache, muscle pain, and vaccination timing as significant predictors, while chronic disease and gender are critical risk factors. These insights provide valuable guidance for understanding long COVID and developing targeted interventions.

<title>Improvements of Dark Experience Replay and Reservoir Sampling towards Better Balance between Consolidation and Plasticity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20932</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills. For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently. DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them. However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them. In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects. This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity. The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it. To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS. Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs. RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data. These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.

<title>Towards Understanding the Nature of Attention with Low-Rank Sparse Decomposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Low-Rank Sparse Attention (Lorsa), a sparse replacement model of Transformer attention layers to disentangle original Multi Head Self Attention (MHSA) into individually comprehensible components. Lorsa is designed to address the challenge of attention superposition to understand attention-mediated interaction between features in different token positions. We show that Lorsa heads find cleaner and finer-grained versions of previously discovered MHSA behaviors like induction heads, successor heads and attention sink behavior (i.e., heavily attending to the first token). Lorsa and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) are both sparse dictionary learning methods applied to different Transformer components, and lead to consistent findings in many ways. For instance, we discover a comprehensive family of arithmetic-specific Lorsa heads, each corresponding to an atomic operation in Llama-3.1-8B. Automated interpretability analysis indicates that Lorsa achieves parity with SAE in interpretability while Lorsa exhibits superior circuit discovery properties, especially for features computed collectively by multiple MHSA heads. We also conduct extensive experiments on architectural design ablation, Lorsa scaling law and error analysis.

<title>Scenario-based Compositional Verification of Autonomous Systems with Neural Perception</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of autonomous systems that use deep neural networks for perception. Formal verification of these systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception DNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for autonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based Modeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of scenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2) Probabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction of perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that represents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and Acceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of the autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations of environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth autonomous car using LiDAR observations.

<title>Deep Learning Characterizes Depression and Suicidal Ideation from Eye Movements</title>

Abstract: Identifying physiological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions is a longstanding challenge in psychiatry. Depression and suicidal ideation, in particular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily relying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye tracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements are directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with attentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for depression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences from 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and subsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical status. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive and negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for both intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify depression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and suicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also exhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from suicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative patterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response generation than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences. The most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences, that are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings highlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and underscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes affecting oculomotor control.

<title>AegisLLM: Scaling Agentic Systems for Self-Reflective Defense in LLM Security</title>

arXiv:2504.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

arXiv:2504.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce softpick, a rectified, not sum-to-one, drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms that eliminates attention sink and massive activations. Our experiments with 340M parameter models demonstrate that softpick maintains performance parity with softmax on standard benchmarks while achieving 0% sink rate. The softpick transformer produces hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis (340 vs 33,510) and creates sparse attention maps (46.97% sparsity). Models using softpick consistently outperform softmax when quantized, with particularly pronounced advantages at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/softpick-attention.

<title>Equivariant non-linear maps for neural networks on homogeneous spaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints. Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention or input dependent kernels, we set out to generalize these insights to the non-linear setting. We derive generalized steerability constraints that any such layer needs to satisfy and prove the universality of our construction. The insights gained into the symmetry-constrained functional dependence of equivariant operators on feature maps and group elements informs the design of future equivariant neural network layers. We demonstrate how several common equivariant network architectures - $G$-CNNs, implicit steerable kernel networks, conventional and relative position embedded attention based transformers, and LieTransformers - may be derived from our framework.

arXiv:2504.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Hubs and Spokes Learning (HSL) framework, a novel paradigm for collaborative machine learning that combines the strengths of Federated Learning (FL) and Decentralized Learning (P2PL). HSL employs a two-tier communication structure that avoids the single point of failure inherent in FL and outperforms the state-of-the-art P2PL framework, Epidemic Learning Local (ELL). At equal communication budgets (total edges), HSL achieves higher performance than ELL, while at significantly lower communication budgets, it can match ELL's performance. For instance, with only 400 edges, HSL reaches the same test accuracy that ELL achieves with 1000 edges for 100 peers (spokes) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating its suitability for resource-constrained systems. HSL also achieves stronger consensus among nodes after mixing, resulting in improved performance with fewer training rounds. We substantiate these claims through rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive experimental results, showcasing HSL's practicality for large-scale collaborative learning.

arXiv:2504.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.

Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.

<title>Tempo: Application-aware LLM Serving with Mixed SLO Requirements</title>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, ranging from interactive chatbots and cloud AIOps to intelligent agents, has introduced a wide spectrum of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on per-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require rapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic dependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This workload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as response lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate even within their design envelopes.
  In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by completing requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual performance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO (e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight, we introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to maximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough serving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others best-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all, it adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper bounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates, prioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as generation progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat, reasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service gain by up to 8.3$\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\times$ SLO goodput compared to state-of-the-art designs

Abstract: The increasing adoption of approximate computing in deep neural network accelerators (AxDNNs) promises significant energy efficiency gains. However, permanent faults in AxDNNs can severely degrade their performance compared to their accurate counterparts (AccDNNs). Traditional fault detection and mitigation approaches, while effective for AccDNNs, introduce substantial overhead and latency, making them impractical for energy-constrained real-time deployment. To address this, we introduce EPSILON, a lightweight framework that leverages pre-computed statistical signatures and layer-wise importance metrics for efficient fault detection and mitigation in AxDNNs. Our framework introduces a novel non-parametric pattern-matching algorithm that enables constant-time fault detection without interrupting normal execution while dynamically adapting to different network architectures and fault patterns. EPSILON maintains model accuracy by intelligently adjusting mitigation strategies based on a statistical analysis of weight distribution and layer criticality while preserving the energy benefits of approximate computing. Extensive evaluations across various approximate multipliers, AxDNN architectures, popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k), and fault scenarios demonstrate that EPSILON maintains 80.05\% accuracy while offering 22\% improvement in inference time and 28\% improvement in energy efficiency, establishing EPSILON as a practical solution for deploying reliable AxDNNs in safety-critical edge applications.

Abstract: To responsibly develop Generative AI (GenAI) products, it is critical to define the scope of acceptable inputs and outputs. What constitutes a "safe" response is an actively debated question. Academic work puts an outsized focus on evaluating models by themselves for general purpose aspects such as toxicity, bias, and fairness, especially in conversational applications being used by a broad audience. In contrast, less focus is put on considering sociotechnical systems in specialized domains. Yet, those specialized systems can be subject to extensive and well-understood legal and regulatory scrutiny. These product-specific considerations need to be set in industry-specific laws, regulations, and corporate governance requirements. In this paper, we aim to highlight AI content safety considerations specific to the financial services domain and outline an associated AI content risk taxonomy. We compare this taxonomy to existing work in this space and discuss implications of risk category violations on various stakeholders. We evaluate how existing open-source technical guardrail solutions cover this taxonomy by assessing them on data collected via red-teaming activities. Our results demonstrate that these guardrails fail to detect most of the content risks we discuss.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of deep residual networks for pricing European options on Petrobras, one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and compares its performance with the Black-Scholes (BS) model. Using eight years of historical data from B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) collected via web scraping, a deep learning model was trained using a custom built hybrid loss function that incorporates market data and analytical pricing. The data for training and testing were drawn between the period spanning November 2016 to January 2025, using an 80-20 train-test split. The test set consisted of data from the final three months: November, December, and January 2025. The deep residual network model achieved a 64.3\% reduction in the mean absolute error for the 3-19 BRL (Brazilian Real) range when compared to the Black-Scholes model on the test set. Furthermore, unlike the Black-Scholes solution, which tends to decrease its accuracy for longer periods of time, the deep learning model performed accurately for longer expiration periods. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in financial modeling, with future work focusing on specialized models for different price ranges.

Our work is both a system demonstration and intended to inspire other CC researchers to explore grounding the generation and evaluation of scientific ideas within foundational CC principles. To this end, we release the annotated dataset used to train Judge, inviting other researchers to explore the use of LLMs for idea generation and creative evaluations.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a core task in drug development and precision medicine in the biomedical field. However, traditional machine learning methods generally have the black box problem, which makes it difficult to reveal the deep correlation between the model decision mechanism and the interaction pattern between biological molecules. This study proposes a heterogeneous network drug target interaction prediction framework, integrating graph neural network and multi scale signal processing technology to construct a model with both efficient prediction and multi level interpretability. Its technical breakthroughs are mainly reflected in the following three dimensions:Local global feature collaborative perception module. Based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network (HGCN), a multi order neighbor aggregation strategy is designed.Multi scale graph signal decomposition and biological interpretation module. A deep hierarchical node feature transform (GWT) architecture is proposed.Contrastive learning combining multi dimensional perspectives and hierarchical representations. By comparing the learning models, the node representations from the two perspectives of HGCN and GWT are aligned and fused, so that the model can integrate multi dimensional information and improve the prediction robustness. Experimental results show that our framework shows excellent prediction performance on all datasets. This study provides a complete solution for drug target discovery from black box prediction to mechanism decoding, and its methodology has important reference value for modeling complex biomolecular interaction systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge.
  This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation.
  Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.

Abstract: Exponential growth in scientific literature has heightened the demand for efficient evidence-based synthesis, driving the rise of the field of Automated Meta-analysis (AMA) powered by natural language processing and machine learning. This PRISMA systematic review introduces a structured framework for assessing the current state of AMA, based on screening 978 papers from 2006 to 2024, and analyzing 54 studies across diverse domains. Findings reveal a predominant focus on automating data processing (57%), such as extraction and statistical modeling, while only 17% address advanced synthesis stages. Just one study (2%) explored preliminary full-process automation, highlighting a critical gap that limits AMA's capacity for comprehensive synthesis. Despite recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and advanced AI, their integration into statistical modeling and higher-order synthesis, such as heterogeneity assessment and bias evaluation, remains underdeveloped. This has constrained AMA's potential for fully autonomous meta-analysis. From our dataset spanning medical (67%) and non-medical (33%) applications, we found that AMA has exhibited distinct implementation patterns and varying degrees of effectiveness in actually improving efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility. While automation has enhanced specific meta-analytic tasks, achieving seamless, end-to-end automation remains an open challenge. As AI systems advance in reasoning and contextual understanding, addressing these gaps is now imperative. Future efforts must focus on bridging automation across all meta-analysis stages, refining interpretability, and ensuring methodological robustness to fully realize AMA's potential for scalable, domain-agnostic synthesis.

<title>TreeHop: Generate and Filter Next Query Embeddings Efficiently for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20114</link>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications. For reproducibility purposes, codes and data are available here: https://github.com/allen-li1231/TreeHop.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models offer significant potential for advancing cell counting applications in neuroscience, medical research, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. However, implementing these models effectively requires robust operational frameworks. This paper introduces Cell Counting Machine Learning Operations (CC-MLOps), a comprehensive framework that streamlines the integration of ML in cell counting workflows. CC-MLOps encompasses data access and preprocessing, model training, monitoring, explainability features, and sustainability considerations. Through a practical use case, we demonstrate how MLOps principles can enhance model reliability, reduce human error, and enable scalable Cell Counting solutions. This work provides actionable guidance for researchers and laboratory professionals seeking to implement machine learning (ML)- powered cell counting systems.

<title>Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction</title>

Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, HimNet. Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.

<title>A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129</link>

Abstract: Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.

<title>MICE for CATs: Model-Internal Confidence Estimation for Calibrating Agents with Tools</title>

Abstract: Tool-using agents that act in the world need to be both useful and safe. Well-calibrated model confidences can be used to weigh the risk versus reward of potential actions, but prior work shows that many models are poorly calibrated. Inspired by interpretability literature exploring the internals of models, we propose a novel class of model-internal confidence estimators (MICE) to better assess confidence when calling tools. MICE first decodes from each intermediate layer of the language model using logitLens and then computes similarity scores between each layer's generation and the final output. These features are fed into a learned probabilistic classifier to assess confidence in the decoded output. On the simulated trial and error (STE) tool-calling dataset using Llama3 models, we find that MICE beats or matches the baselines on smoothed expected calibration error. Using MICE confidences to determine whether to call a tool significantly improves over strong baselines on a new metric, expected tool-calling utility. Further experiments show that MICE is sample-efficient, can generalize zero-shot to unseen APIs, and results in higher tool-calling utility in scenarios with varying risk levels. Our code is open source, available at https://github.com/microsoft/mice_for_cats.

<title>A Transformer-based Multimodal Fusion Model for Efficient Crowd Counting Using Visual and Wireless Signals</title>

Abstract: Current crowd-counting models often rely on single-modal inputs, such as visual images or wireless signal data, which can result in significant information loss and suboptimal recognition performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose TransFusion, a novel multimodal fusion-based crowd- counting model that integrates Channel State Information (CSI) with image data. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Transformer networks, TransFusion effectively combines these two distinct data modalities, enabling the capture of comprehen- sive global contextual information that is critical for accurate crowd estimation. However, while transformers are well capable of capturing global features, they potentially fail to identify finer- grained, local details essential for precise crowd counting. To mitigate this, we incorporate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the model architecture, enhancing its ability to extract detailed local features that complement the global context provided by the Transformer. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that TransFusion achieves high accuracy with minimal counting errors while maintaining superior efficiency.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equation (ODE) based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for producing high-quality samples in many applications. However, the ODE-based methods either suffer the discretization error of numerical solvers of ODE, which restricts the quality of samples when only a few NFEs are used, or struggle with training instability. In this paper, we proposed Integration Flow, which directly learns the integral of ODE-based trajectory paths without solving the ODE functions. Moreover, Integration Flow explicitly incorporates the target state $\mathbf{x}_0$ as the anchor state in guiding the reverse-time dynamics. We have theoretically proven this can contribute to both stability and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, Integration Flow is the first model with a unified structure to estimate ODE-based generative models and the first to show the exact straightness of 1-Rectified Flow without reflow. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we show that Integration Flows achieve improved performance when it is applied to existing ODE-based models, such as diffusion models, Rectified Flows, and PFGM++. Specifically, Integration Flow achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FIDs of 2.86 for the Variance Exploding (VE) diffusion model, 3.36 for rectified flow without reflow, and 2.91 for PFGM++; and on ImageNet with FIDs of 4.09 for VE diffusion model, 4.35 for rectified flow without reflow and 4.15 for PFGM++.

Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of neural network graph compilers across heterogeneous hardware platforms, addressing the critical gap between theoretical optimization techniques and practical deployment scenarios. We demonstrate how vendor-specific optimizations can invalidate relative performance comparisons between architectural archetypes, with performance advantages sometimes completely reversing after compilation. Our systematic analysis reveals that graph compilers exhibit performance patterns highly dependent on both neural architecture and batch sizes. Through fine-grained block-level experimentation, we establish that vendor-specific compilers can leverage repeated patterns in simple architectures, yielding disproportionate throughput gains as model depth increases. We introduce novel metrics to quantify a compiler's ability to mitigate performance friction as batch size increases. Our methodology bridges the gap between academic research and practical deployment by incorporating compiler effects throughout the research process, providing actionable insights for practitioners navigating complex optimization landscapes across heterogeneous hardware environments.

Abstract: Atmospheric predictability research has long held that the limit of skillful deterministic weather forecasts is about 14 days. We challenge this limit using GraphCast, a machine-learning weather model, by optimizing forecast initial conditions using gradient-based techniques for twice-daily forecasts spanning 2020. This approach yields an average error reduction of 86% at 10 days, with skill lasting beyond 30 days. Mean optimal initial-condition perturbations reveal large-scale, spatially coherent corrections to ERA5, primarily reflecting an intensification of the Hadley circulation. Forecasts using GraphCast-optimal initial conditions in the Pangu-Weather model achieve a 21% error reduction, peaking at 4 days, indicating that analysis corrections reflect a combination of both model bias and a reduction in analysis error. These results demonstrate that, given accurate initial conditions, skillful deterministic forecasts are consistently achievable far beyond two weeks, challenging long-standing assumptions about the limits of atmospheric predictability.

Abstract: Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) help improve real-time monitoring and decision-making in water distribution systems. However, their connectivity makes them easy targets for cyberattacks such as scanning, denial-of-service (DoS), and unauthorized access. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manage these systems often do not have enough budget or staff to build strong cybersecurity teams. To solve this problem, we present a Virtual Cybersecurity Department (VCD), an affordable and automated framework designed for SMEs. The VCD uses open-source tools like Zabbix for real-time monitoring, Suricata for network intrusion detection, Fail2Ban to block repeated login attempts, and simple firewall settings. To improve threat detection, we also add a machine-learning-based IDS trained on the OD-IDS2022 dataset using an improved ensemble model. This model detects cyber threats such as brute-force attacks, remote code execution (RCE), and network flooding, with 92\% accuracy and fewer false alarms. Our solution gives SMEs a practical and efficient way to secure water systems using low-cost and easy-to-manage tools.

Abstract: Water distribution systems in rural areas face serious challenges such as a lack of real-time monitoring, vulnerability to cyberattacks, and unreliable data handling. This paper presents an integrated framework that combines LoRaWAN-based data acquisition, a machine learning-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and a blockchain-enabled Digital Twin (BC-DT) platform for secure and transparent water management. The IDS filters anomalous or spoofed data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder and Isolation Forest before validated data is logged via smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. The verified data feeds into a real-time DT model supporting leak detection, consumption forecasting, and predictive maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves over 80 transactions per second (TPS) with under 2 seconds of latency while remaining cost-effective and scalable for up to 1,000 smart meters. This work demonstrates a practical and secure architecture for decentralized water infrastructure in under-connected rural environments.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification aims to recognize objects belonging to multiple subordinate categories within a super-category. However, this remains a challenging problem, as appearance information alone is often insufficient to accurately differentiate between fine-grained visual categories. To address this, we propose a novel and unified framework that leverages meta-information to assist fine-grained identification. We tackle the joint learning of visual and meta-information through cross-contrastive pre-training. In the first stage, we employ three encoders for images, text, and meta-information, aligning their projected embeddings to achieve better representations. We then fine-tune the image and meta-information encoders for the classification task. Experiments on the NABirds dataset demonstrate that our framework effectively utilizes meta-information to enhance fine-grained recognition performance. With the addition of meta-information, our framework surpasses the current baseline on NABirds by 7.83%. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy of 84.44% on the NABirds dataset, outperforming many existing state-of-the-art approaches that utilize meta-information.

Abstract: This report addresses the challenge of limited labeled datasets for developing legal recommender systems, particularly in specialized domains like labor disputes. We propose a new approach leveraging the co-citation of legal articles within cases to establish similarity and enable algorithmic annotation. This method draws a parallel to the concept of case co-citation, utilizing cited precedents as indicators of shared legal issues. To evaluate the labeled results, we employ a system that recommends similar cases based on plaintiffs' accusations, defendants' rebuttals, and points of disputes. The evaluation demonstrates that the recommender, with finetuned text embedding models and a reasonable BiLSTM module can recommend labor cases whose similarity was measured by the co-citation of the legal articles. This research contributes to the development of automated annotation techniques for legal documents, particularly in areas with limited access to comprehensive legal databases.

Abstract: In recent years, the use of prompts to guide the output of Large Language Models have increased dramatically. However, even the best of experts struggle to choose the correct words to stitch up a prompt for the desired task. To solve this, LLM driven prompt optimization emerged as an important problem. Existing prompt optimization methods optimize a prompt globally, where in all the prompt tokens have to be optimized over a large vocabulary while solving a complex task. The large optimization space (tokens) leads to insufficient guidance for a better prompt. In this work, we introduce Local Prompt Optimization (LPO) that integrates with any general automatic prompt engineering method. We identify the optimization tokens in a prompt and nudge the LLM to focus only on those tokens in its optimization step. We observe remarkable performance improvements on Math Reasoning (GSM8k and MultiArith) and BIG-bench Hard benchmarks across various automatic prompt engineering methods. Further, we show that LPO converges to the optimal prompt faster than global methods.

Abstract: Diagnostic reasoning entails a physician's local (mental) model based on an assumed or known shared perspective (global model) to explain patient observations with evidence assigned towards a clinical assessment. But in several (complex) medical situations, multiple experts work together as a team to optimize health evaluation and decision-making by leveraging different perspectives. Such consensus-driven reasoning reflects individual knowledge contributing toward a broader perspective on the patient. In this light, we introduce STRUCture-following for Multiagent Systems (STRUC-MAS), a framework automating the learning of these global models and their incorporation as prior beliefs for agents in multiagent systems (MAS) to follow. We demonstrate proof of concept with a prosocial MAS application for predicting acute kidney injuries (AKIs). In this case, we found that incorporating a global structure enabled multiple agents to achieve better performance (average precision, AP) in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset (structure-following-fine-tuned, SF-FT, AP=0.195; SF-FT-retrieval-augmented generation, SF-FT-RAG, AP=0.194) vs. baseline (non-structure-following-FT, NSF-FT, AP=0.141; NSF-FT-RAG, AP=0.180) for balanced precision-weighted-recall-weighted voting. Markedly, SF-FT agents with higher recall scores reported lower confidence levels in the initial round on true positive and false negative cases. But after explicit interactions, their confidence in their decisions increased (suggesting reinforced belief). In contrast, the SF-FT agent with the lowest recall decreased its confidence in true positive and false negative cases (suggesting a new belief). This approach suggests that learning and leveraging global structures in MAS is necessary prior to achieving competitive classification and diagnostic reasoning performance.

Abstract: Optical computing systems provide an alternate hardware model which appears to be aligned with the demands of neural network workloads. However, the challenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key requirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability to drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.

Abstract: While deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, existing work has largely focused on pathologies where diagnosis is not a clinical challenge, leaving more difficult problems underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging features, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This study introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework for detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the gold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71 standard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83% and 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched or surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that DL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard MRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging data, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the development of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Combining physics-based modeling with data-driven methods is critical to enabling the translation of computational methods to clinical use in cardiology. The use of rigorous differential equations combined with machine learning tools allows for model personalization with uncertainty quantification in time frames compatible with clinical practice. However, accurate and efficient surrogate models of cardiac function, built from physics-based numerical simulation, are still mostly geometry-specific and require retraining for different patients and pathological conditions. We propose a novel computational pipeline to embed cardiac anatomies into full-field surrogate models. We generate a dataset of electrophysiology simulations using a complex multi-scale mathematical model coupling partial and ordinary differential equations. We adopt Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) as an effective scientific machine learning method to encode activation maps extracted from physics-based numerical simulations into a neural network. Leveraging large deformation diffeomorphic metric mappings, we build a biventricular anatomical atlas and parametrize the anatomical variability of a small and challenging cohort of 13 pediatric patients affected by Tetralogy of Fallot. We propose a novel statistical shape modeling based z-score sampling approach to generate a new synthetic cohort of 52 biventricular geometries that are compatible with the original geometrical variability. This synthetic cohort acts as the training set for BLNMs. Our surrogate model demonstrates robustness and great generalization across the complex original patient cohort, achieving an average adimensional mean squared error of 0.0034. The Python implementation of our BLNM model is publicly available under MIT License at https://github.com/StanfordCBCL/BLNM.

Abstract: We present UniDetox, a universally applicable method designed to mitigate toxicity across various large language models (LLMs). Previous detoxification methods are typically model-specific, addressing only individual models or model families, and require careful hyperparameter tuning due to the trade-off between detoxification efficacy and language modeling performance. In contrast, UniDetox provides a detoxification technique that can be universally applied to a wide range of LLMs without the need for separate model-specific tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient dataset distillation technique for detoxification using contrastive decoding. This approach distills detoxifying representations in the form of synthetic text data, enabling universal detoxification of any LLM through fine-tuning with the distilled text. Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from GPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. Furthermore, UniDetox eliminates the need for separate hyperparameter tuning for each model, as a single hyperparameter configuration can be seamlessly applied across different models. Additionally, analysis of the detoxifying text reveals a reduction in politically biased content, providing insights into the attributes necessary for effective detoxification of LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can be affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied loss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the defined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the training dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the residual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature extraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error, physical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is designed and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural network (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by experimental imaging test.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for generating point clouds from WiFi Channel State Information data. We employ a two-stage autoencoder approach: a PointNet autoencoder with convolutional layers for point cloud generation, and a Convolutional Neural Network autoencoder to map CSI data to a matching latent space. By aligning these latent spaces, our method enables accurate environmental point cloud reconstruction from WiFi data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for wireless sensing and environmental mapping applications.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very useful methods to address semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets, thanks to their ability to generate samples similar to real data. This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many researchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide the evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular, several co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate populations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some spatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular evolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation and follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper, we re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new co-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN), with panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in the offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one offspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison with a classical SSL-GAN.

Abstract: We present ReasonIR-8B, the first retriever specifically trained for general reasoning tasks. Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.

Abstract: We study the consistency of minimum-norm interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces corresponding to bounded kernels. Our main result give lower bounds for the generalization error of the kernel interpolation measured in a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L^2$ and the hypothesis space. These lower bounds imply that kernel interpolation is always inconsistent, when the smoothness index of the norm is larger than a constant that depends only on the embedding index of the hypothesis space and the decay rate of the eigenvalues.

<title>Data Driven Deep Learning for Correcting Global Climate Model Projections of SST and DSL in the Bay of Bengal</title>

Abstract: Climate change alters ocean conditions, notably temperature and sea level. In the Bay of Bengal, these changes influence monsoon precipitation and marine productivity, critical to the Indian economy. In Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), Global Climate Models (GCMs) use different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to obtain future climate projections. However, significant discrepancies are observed between these models and the reanalysis data in the Bay of Bengal for 2015-2024. Specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the climate model output and the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5) is 1.2C for the sea surface temperature (SST) and 1.1 m for the dynamic sea level (DSL). We introduce a new data-driven deep learning model to correct for this bias. The deep neural model for each variable is trained using pairs of climatology-removed monthly climate projections as input and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as output. This model is trained with historical data (1950 to 2014), validated with future projection data from 2015 to 2020, and tested with future projections from 2021 to 2023. Compared to the conventional EquiDistant Cumulative Distribution Function (EDCDF) statistical method for bias correction in climate models, our approach decreases RMSE by 0.15C for SST and 0.3 m for DSL. The trained model subsequently corrects the projections for 2024-2100. A detailed analysis of the monthly, seasonal, and decadal means and variability is performed to underscore the implications of the novel dynamics uncovered in our corrected projections.

<title>On Stochastic Rounding with Few Random Bits</title>

Abstract: Large-scale numerical computations make increasing use of low-precision (LP) floating point formats and mixed precision arithmetic, which can be enhanced by the technique of stochastic rounding (SR), that is, rounding an intermediate high-precision value up or down randomly as a function of the value's distance to the two rounding candidates. Stochastic rounding requires, in addition to the high-precision input value, a source of random bits. As the provision of high-quality random bits is an additional computational cost, it is of interest to require as few bits as possible while maintaining the desirable properties of SR in a given computation, or computational domain. This paper examines a number of possible implementations of few-bit stochastic rounding (FBSR), and shows how several natural implementations can introduce sometimes significant bias into the rounding process, which are not present in the case of infinite-bit, infinite-precision examinations of these implementations. The paper explores the impact of these biases in machine learning examples, and hence opens another class of configuration parameters of which practitioners should be aware when developing or adopting low-precision floating point. Code is available at http://github.com/graphcore-research/arith25-stochastic-rounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

Abstract: In many, if not most, machine learning applications the training data is naturally heterogeneous (e.g. federated learning, adversarial attacks and domain adaptation in neural net training). Data heterogeneity is identified as one of the major challenges in modern day large-scale learning. A classical way to represent heterogeneous data is via a mixture model. In this paper, we study generalization performance and statistical rates when data is sampled from a mixture distribution. We first characterize the heterogeneity of the mixture in terms of the pairwise total variation distance of the sub-population distributions. Thereafter, as a central theme of this paper, we characterize the range where the mixture may be treated as a single (homogeneous) distribution for learning. In particular, we study the generalization performance under the classical PAC framework and the statistical error rates for parametric (linear regression, mixture of hyperplanes) as well as non-parametric (Lipschitz, convex and H\"older-smooth) regression problems. In order to do this, we obtain Rademacher complexity and (local) Gaussian complexity bounds with mixture data, and apply them to get the generalization and convergence rates respectively. We observe that as the (regression) function classes get more complex, the requirement on the pairwise total variation distance gets stringent, which matches our intuition. We also do a finer analysis for the case of mixed linear regression and provide a tight bound on the generalization error in terms of heterogeneity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/SubthoughtReasoner.

Abstract: Public vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), document vulnerabilities and facilitate threat information sharing. However, they often suffer from short descriptions and outdated or insufficient information. In this paper, we introduce Zad, a system designed to enrich NVD vulnerability descriptions by leveraging external resources. Zad consists of two pipelines: one collects and filters supplementary data using two encoders to build a detailed dataset, while the other fine-tunes a pre-trained model on this dataset to generate enriched descriptions. By addressing brevity and improving content quality, Zad produces more comprehensive and cohesive vulnerability descriptions. We evaluate Zad using standard summarization metrics and human assessments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing vulnerability information.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it. Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple modalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified baselines.

Abstract: Since the early days of the Explainable AI movement, post-hoc explanations have been praised for their potential to improve user understanding, promote trust, and reduce patient safety risks in black box medical AI systems. Recently, however, critics have argued that the benefits of post-hoc explanations are greatly exaggerated since they merely approximate, rather than replicate, the actual reasoning processes that black box systems take to arrive at their outputs. In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc explanations against this recent critique. We argue that even if post-hoc explanations do not replicate the exact reasoning processes of black box systems, they can still improve users' functional understanding of black box systems, increase the accuracy of clinician-AI teams, and assist clinicians in justifying their AI-informed decisions. While post-hoc explanations are not a "silver bullet" solution to the black box problem in medical AI, we conclude that they remain a useful strategy for addressing the black box problem in medical AI.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.

Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.

Abstract: This paper introduces SoccerDiffusion, a transformer-based diffusion model designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code under: https://bit-bots.github.io/SoccerDiffusion

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial and time-consuming task in clinical care, where mask precision is extremely important. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface based on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This model has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined classes, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural images and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition, this model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on 3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging are based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D objects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important features such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method for segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we train a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding boxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative inference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the model's ability to segment 3D objects in CT images from a single prompt and evaluate the models' out-of-domain transfer and edition capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art models on this benchmark using the AMOS abdominal organ segmentation dataset.

Abstract: As new products are emerging daily, recommendation systems are required to quickly adapt to possible new domains without needing extensive retraining. This work presents ``X-Cross'' -- a novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and adaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and providing an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.

<title>Preference-centric Bandits: Optimality of Mixtures and Regret-efficient Algorithms</title>

Abstract: The objective of canonical multi-armed bandits is to identify and repeatedly select an arm with the largest reward, often in the form of the expected value of the arm's probability distribution. Such a utilitarian perspective and focus on the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the distributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks in decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting from expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed a preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different reward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that incorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward uncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric perspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly different principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal sampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in the PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of arms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs from the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways, primarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes the PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent and anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion. These algorithms have two distinctions from their canonical counterparts: (i) they involve an estimation routine to form reliable estimates of optimal mixtures, and (ii) they are equipped with tracking mechanisms to navigate arm selection fractions to track the optimal mixtures. These algorithms' regret guarantees are investigated under various algebraic forms of the PMs.

Abstract: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

<title>Guessing Efficiently for Constrained Subspace Approximation</title>

Abstract: In this paper we study constrained subspace approximation problem. Given a set of $n$ points $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal of the {\em subspace approximation} problem is to find a $k$ dimensional subspace that best approximates the input points. More precisely, for a given $p\geq 1$, we aim to minimize the $p$th power of the $\ell_p$ norm of the error vector $(\|a_1-\bm{P}a_1\|,\ldots,\|a_n-\bm{P}a_n\|)$, where $\bm{P}$ denotes the projection matrix onto the subspace and the norms are Euclidean. In \emph{constrained} subspace approximation (CSA), we additionally have constraints on the projection matrix $\bm{P}$. In its most general form, we require $\bm{P}$ to belong to a given subset $\mathcal{S}$ that is described explicitly or implicitly.
  We introduce a general framework for constrained subspace approximation. Our approach, that we term coreset-guess-solve, yields either $(1+\varepsilon)$-multiplicative or $\varepsilon$-additive approximations for a variety of constraints. We show that it provides new algorithms for partition-constrained subspace approximation with applications to {\it fair} subspace approximation, $k$-means clustering, and projected non-negative matrix factorization, among others. Specifically, while we reconstruct the best known bounds for $k$-means clustering in Euclidean spaces, we improve the known results for the remainder of the problems.

Abstract: A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its biases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.

Abstract: Interpretable malware detection is crucial for understanding harmful behaviors and building trust in automated security systems. Traditional explainable methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often highlight important regions within a graph but fail to associate them with known benign or malicious behavioral patterns. This limitation reduces their utility in security contexts, where alignment with verified prototypes is essential. In this work, we introduce a novel dual prototype-driven explainable framework that interprets GNN-based malware detection decisions. This dual explainable framework integrates a base explainer (a state-of-the-art explainer) with a novel second-level explainer which is designed by subgraph matching technique, called SubMatch explainer. The proposed explainer assigns interpretable scores to nodes based on their association with matched subgraphs, offering a fine-grained distinction between benign and malicious regions. This prototype-guided scoring mechanism enables more interpretable, behavior-aligned explanations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves high detection performance while significantly improving interpretability in malware analysis.

Abstract: The continuous monitoring of the interactions between cyber-physical components of any industrial control system (ICS) is required to secure automation of the system controls, and to guarantee plant processes are fail-safe and remain in an acceptably safe state. Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time complexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using dimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide explainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art AI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Further, we pin-point the sensor(s) and its actuation state for which anomaly was detected.

Abstract: Early exits (EEs) offer a promising approach to reducing computational costs and latency by dynamically terminating inference once a satisfactory prediction confidence on a data sample is achieved. Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.

Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.

Abstract: Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of pneumonia through X-ray imaging is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled automated diagnostic tools that assist radiologists in making more reliable and efficient decisions. In this work, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition-based Least Squares (SVD-LS) framework for multi-class pneumonia classification, leveraging powerful feature representations from state-of-the-art self-supervised and transfer learning models. Rather than relying on computationally expensive gradient based fine-tuning, we employ a closed-form, non-iterative classification approach that ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-LS achieves competitive performance while offering significantly reduced computational costs, making it a viable alternative for real-time medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.

Abstract: LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution.
  In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.

Abstract: The study of feature propagation at initialization in neural networks lies at the root of numerous initialization designs. An assumption very commonly made in the field states that the pre-activations are Gaussian. Although this convenient Gaussian hypothesis can be justified when the number of neurons per layer tends to infinity, it is challenged by both theoretical and experimental works for finite-width neural networks. Our major contribution is to construct a family of pairs of activation functions and initialization distributions that ensure that the pre-activations remain Gaussian throughout the network's depth, even in narrow neural networks. In the process, we discover a set of constraints that a neural network should fulfill to ensure Gaussian pre-activations. Additionally, we provide a critical review of the claims of the Edge of Chaos line of works and build an exact Edge of Chaos analysis. We also propose a unified view on pre-activations propagation, encompassing the framework of several well-known initialization procedures. Finally, our work provides a principled framework for answering the much-debated question: is it desirable to initialize the training of a neural network whose pre-activations are ensured to be Gaussian?

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to learn several tasks simultaneously for better sample efficiency than learning them separately. Traditional methods achieve this by sharing parameters or relabeled data between tasks. In this work, we introduce a new framework for sharing behavioral policies across tasks, which can be used in addition to existing MTRL methods. The key idea is to improve each task's off-policy data collection by employing behaviors from other task policies. Selectively sharing helpful behaviors acquired in one task to collect training data for another task can lead to higher-quality trajectories, leading to more sample-efficient MTRL. Thus, we introduce a simple and principled framework called Q-switch mixture of policies (QMP) that selectively shares behavior between different task policies by using the task's Q-function to evaluate and select useful shareable behaviors. We theoretically analyze how QMP improves the sample efficiency of the underlying RL algorithm. Our experiments show that QMP's behavioral policy sharing provides complementary gains over many popular MTRL algorithms and outperforms alternative ways to share behaviors in various manipulation, locomotion, and navigation environments.

Abstract: A central issue lying at the heart of online reinforcement learning (RL) is data efficiency. While a number of recent works achieved asymptotically minimal regret in online RL, the optimality of these results is only guaranteed in a ``large-sample'' regime, imposing enormous burn-in cost in order for their algorithms to operate optimally. How to achieve minimax-optimal regret without incurring any burn-in cost has been an open problem in RL theory.
  We settle this problem for the context of finite-horizon inhomogeneous Markov decision processes. Specifically, we prove that a modified version of Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP), a model-based algorithm proposed by \cite{zhang2020reinforcement}, achieves a regret on the order of (modulo log factors) \begin{equation*}
  \min\big\{ \sqrt{SAH^3K}, \,HK \big\}, \end{equation*} where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the planning horizon, and $K$ is the total number of episodes. This regret matches the minimax lower bound for the entire range of sample size $K\geq 1$, essentially eliminating any burn-in requirement. It also translates to a PAC sample complexity (i.e., the number of episodes needed to yield $\varepsilon$-accuracy) of $\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}$ up to log factor, which is minimax-optimal for the full $\varepsilon$-range.
  Further, we extend our theory to unveil the influences of problem-dependent quantities like the optimal value/cost and certain variances. The key technical innovation lies in the development of a new regret decomposition strategy and a novel analysis paradigm to decouple complicated statistical dependency -- a long-standing challenge facing the analysis of online RL in the sample-hungry regime.

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are gaining attention from academia and industry as a growing subject in industrial applications and as a powerful way of identifying faults. This paper provides an overview of intelligent condition monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis methods for industrial plants with a focus on the open-source benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). In this survey, the most popular and state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for industrial plant condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm are studied. Challenges like imbalanced data, unlabelled samples and how deep learning models can handle them are also covered. Finally, a comparison of the accuracies and specifications of different algorithms utilizing the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) is conducted. This research will be beneficial for both researchers who are new to the field and experts, as it covers the literature on condition monitoring and state-of-the-art methods alongside the challenges and possible solutions to them.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML). This interest is driven by the numerous real-life situations where multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which represents the optimal trade-offs between different objectives. Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature serving as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners aiming to apply MOO effectively. In this paper, our goal is to provide such a resource and highlight pitfalls to avoid. We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more advanced techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA). We critically review existing studies across various ML fields where MOO has been applied and identify challenges that can lead to incorrect interpretations. One of these fields is physics informed neural networks (PINNs), which we use as a guiding example to carefully construct experiments illustrating these pitfalls. By comparing WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II, we demonstrate that difficulties can arise regardless of the specific MOO method used. We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence criteria can result in misleading experiments.

<title>Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling</title>

Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.

Abstract: Monitoring the stress level in patients with neurodegenerative diseases can help manage symptoms, improve patient's quality of life, and provide insight into disease progression. In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like wristbands and smartwatches, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a wristband based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we finetuned for the task and equipped with explainability features. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.

Abstract: Data uncertainty is inherent in many real-world applications and poses significant challenges for accurate time series predictions. The interval type 2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has shown exceptional performance in uncertainty modelling for single-step prediction tasks. However, extending it for multi-step ahead predictions introduces further issues in uncertainty handling as well as model interpretability and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new selforganizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO). Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network architecture is developed. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step time series prediction problems. Second, a new link layer is created to improve the accuracy by building temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Third, a new transformation layer is designed to address the problem of the vanishing rule strength caused by high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, a two-stage, self-organizing learning mechanism is developed to automatically extract fuzzy rules from data and optimize network parameters. Experimental results on chaotic and microgrid prediction problems demonstrate that SOIT2FNN-MO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a better accuracy ranging from 1.6% to 30% depending on the level of noises in data. Additionally, the proposed model is more interpretable, offering deeper insights into the prediction process.

Abstract: We present a framework for modeling multi-scale processes, and study its performance in the context of streamflow forecasting in hydrology. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural architecture that factorizes the system dynamics at multiple temporal scales and captures their interactions. This framework consists of an inverse and a forward model. The inverse model is used to empirically resolve the system's temporal modes from data (physical model simulations, observed data, or a combination of them from the past), and these states are then used in the forward model to predict streamflow. Experiments on several catchments from the National Weather Service North Central River Forecast Center show that FHNN outperforms standard baselines, including physics-based models and transformer-based approaches. The model demonstrates particular effectiveness in catchments with low runoff ratios and colder climates. We further validate FHNN on the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies), which is a widely used continental-scale hydrology benchmark dataset, confirming consistent performance improvements for 1-7 day streamflow forecasts across diverse hydrological conditions. Additionally, we show that FHNN can maintain accuracy even with limited training data through effective pre-training strategies and training global models.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for safeguarding individual data privacy. To utilize DP in training modern machine learning models, differentially private optimizers have been widely used in recent years. A popular approach to privatize an optimizer is to clip the individual gradients and add sufficiently large noise to the clipped gradient. This approach led to the development of DP optimizers that have comparable performance with their non-private counterparts in fine-tuning tasks or in tasks with a small number of training parameters. However, a significant performance drop is observed when these optimizers are applied to large-scale training. This degradation stems from the substantial noise injection required to maintain DP, which disrupts the optimizer's dynamics. This paper introduces DiSK, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the performance of DP optimizers. DiSK employs Kalman filtering, a technique drawn from control and signal processing, to effectively denoise privatized gradients and generate progressively refined gradient estimations. To ensure practicality for large-scale training, we simplify the Kalman filtering process, minimizing its memory and computational demands. We establish theoretical privacy-utility trade-off guarantees for DiSK, and demonstrate provable improvements over standard DP optimizers like DPSGD in terms of iteration complexity upper-bound. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including vision tasks such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k and language fine-tuning tasks such as GLUE, E2E, and DART, validate the effectiveness of DiSK. The results showcase its ability to significantly improve the performance of DP optimizers, surpassing state-of-the-art results under the same privacy constraints on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal injuries during military training significantly impact readiness, making prevention through activity monitoring crucial. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices offers promising solutions, it faces challenges in processing continuous data streams and recognizing diverse activities without predefined sessions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for preprocessing, analyzing, and recognizing activities from wearable data in military training contexts. Using data from 135 soldiers wearing \textit{Garmin--55} smartwatches over six months with over 15 million minutes. We develop a hierarchical deep learning approach that achieves 93.8% accuracy in temporal splits and 83.8% in cross-user evaluation. Our framework addresses missing data through physiologically-informed methods, reducing unknown sleep states from 40.38% to 3.66%. We demonstrate that while longer time windows (45-60 minutes) improve basic state classification, they present trade-offs in detecting fine-grained activities. Additionally, we introduce an intuitive visualization system that enables real-time comparison of individual performance against group metrics across multiple physiological indicators. This approach to activity recognition and performance monitoring provides military trainers with actionable insights for optimizing training programs and preventing injuries.

<title>Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks</title>

Abstract: Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) uses multiple nodes to accelerate training, enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered.
  In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.

Abstract: We discuss several aspects of the loss landscape of regularized neural networks: the structure of stationary points, connectivity of optimal solutions, path with nonincreasing loss to arbitrary global optimum, and the nonuniqueness of optimal solutions, by casting the problem into an equivalent convex problem and considering its dual. Starting from two-layer neural networks with scalar output, we first characterize the solution set of the convex problem using its dual and further characterize all stationary points. With the characterization, we show that the topology of the global optima goes through a phase transition as the width of the network changes, and construct counterexamples where the problem may have a continuum of optimal solutions. Finally, we show that the solution set characterization and connectivity results can be extended to different architectures, including two-layer vector-valued neural networks and parallel three-layer neural networks.

Abstract: Seismic data is often sparse and unevenly distributed due to the high costs and logistical challenges associated with deploying physical seismometers, limiting the application of Machine Learning (ML) in earthquake analysis. While simulation methods exist, no tool allows the generation of large datasets containing simulated measurements of the ground motion. To address this gap, we introduce PyAWD, a Python library designed to generate high-resolution synthetic datasets simulating spatio-temporal acoustic wave propagation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional heterogeneous media. By allowing fine control over parameters such as the wave speed, external forces, spatial and temporal discretization, and media composition, PyAWD enables the creation of ML-scale datasets that capture the complexity of seismic wave behavior. We illustrate the library's potential with an epicenter retrieval task, showcasing its suitability for designing complex, accurate seismic problems that require advanced ML approaches in the absence or lack of dense real-world data. We also show the usefulness of our tool to tackle the problem of data budgeting in the framework of epicenter retrieval.

Abstract: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.

Abstract: Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data, which leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL) tackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and using weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However, existing pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global knowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally, local models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process, potentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER, a novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model personalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning abilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates global information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model cost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer during local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each local model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global representation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global aggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on average, by 5.40\% (up to 14.29\%).

Abstract: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. In response to this challenge, we take inspiration from recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets) and propose a reinforcement learning method for diffusion model finetuning, dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients for probabilistic diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.

Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points. The code is available at https://github.com/quest-lab-iisc/PINTO

Abstract: The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of contagious diseases is critical for public health policymaking and pandemic preparedness. We propose a new infectious disease forecasting model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an emerging scientific machine learning approach. By embedding a compartmental model into the loss function, our method integrates epidemiological theory with data, helping to prevent model overfitting. We further enhance the model with a sub-network that accounts for covariates such as mobility and cumulative vaccine doses, which influence the transmission rate. Using state-level COVID-19 data from California, we demonstrate that the PINN model accurately predicts cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, aligning well with existing benchmarks. Notably, the PINN model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and several sequence deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformers. It also achieves performance comparable to a sophisticated Gaussian infection state forecasting model that combines compartmental dynamics, a data observation model, and parameter regression. However, the PINN model features a simpler structure and is easier to implement. In summary, we systematically evaluate the PINN model's ability to forecast infectious disease dynamics, demonstrating its potential as an efficient computational tool to strengthen forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Using a deep generative machine learning approach, we synthesise human activity participations and scheduling (the choices of what activities to participate in and when). Activity schedules, which represent what people do and when, are a core component of many applied transport, energy, and epidemiology models. Our data-driven approach learns the distributions resulting from human preferences and scheduling logic without the need for complex interacting combinations of sub-models and custom rules, This makes our approach significantly faster and simpler to operate than existing approaches to synthesise or anonymise schedule data. We additionally contribute a novel schedule representation and a comprehensive evaluation framework. We evaluate a range of schedule encoding and deep model architecture combinations. The evaluation shows our approach can rapidly generate large, diverse, novel, and realistic synthetic samples of activity schedules.

Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.

Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their inference demands present significant challenges, particularly due to the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters. These facilities require specialized cooling and power management systems, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs). In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics and constraints of LLM inference from a TCO perspective, focusing on two representative accelerators: the Gaudi 2 and NVIDIA H100. We present a generalizable framework that enables CSPs to compare and select AI accelerators according to diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we analyze the impact of FP8 precision and LLM inference workload characteristics as key factors influencing TCO. We investigate FP8 quantization, which is gaining adoption in LLM training, as a technique to improve inference throughput while maintaining cost efficiency. Furthermore, our analysis of LLM inference workloads reveals that performance on thin GEMMs, which dominate the decode phase, can have a greater impact than theoretical hardware peak performance. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we offer insights that support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs to improve the TCO of LLM inference.

<title>LoCA: Location-Aware Cosine Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a prevalent method for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. However, the simple low-rank decomposition form may constrain the hypothesis space. To address this limitation, we introduce Location-aware Cosine Adaptation (LoCA), a novel frequency-domain parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (iDCT) with selective locations of learnable components. We begin with a comprehensive theoretical comparison between frequency-domain and low-rank decompositions for fine-tuning pre-trained large models. Our analysis reveals that frequency-domain decomposition with carefully selected frequency components can surpass the expressivity of traditional low-rank-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that iDCT offers a more efficient implementation compared to inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (iDFT), allowing for better selection and tuning of frequency components while maintaining equivalent expressivity to the optimal iDFT-based adaptation. By employing finite-difference approximation to estimate gradients for discrete locations of learnable coefficients on the DCT spectrum, LoCA dynamically selects the most informative frequency components during training. Experiments on diverse language and vision fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that LoCA offers enhanced parameter efficiency while maintains computational feasibility comparable to low-rank-based methods.

Abstract: A latent denoising semantic communication (SemCom) framework is proposed for robust image transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating a learnable latent denoiser into the receiver, the received signals are preprocessed to effectively remove the channel noise and recover the semantic information, thereby enhancing the quality of the decoded images. Specifically, a latent denoising mapping is established by an iterative residual learning approach to improve the denoising efficiency while ensuring stable performance. Moreover, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is utilized to estimate and predict the latent similarity score (SS) for conditional denoising, where the number of denoising steps is adapted based on the predicted SS sequence, further reducing the communication latency. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively and efficiently remove the channel noise at various levels and reconstruct visual-appealing images.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to task-agnostic exploration when we aim to explore the environment without access to the task specification a priori. In a single-agent setting the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach cast the task-agnostic objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follows. In contrast, little is known about task-agnostic exploration in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. How should different agents explore in the presence of others? In this paper, we address this question through a generalization to multiple agents of the problem of maximizing the state distribution entropy. First, we investigate alternative formulations, highlighting respective positives and negatives. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide proof of concept experiments to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for task-agnostic exploration in challenging multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Aircraft manufacturing is the jewel in the crown of industry, among which generating high-fidelity airfoil geometries with controllable and editable representations remains a fundamental challenge. While existing deep-learning-based methods rely on predefined parametric function families, e.g., B\'ezier curves and discrete point-based representations, they suffer from inherent trade-offs between expressiveness and resolution flexibility. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FuncGenFoil, a novel function-space generative model that directly learns functional airfoil geometries. Our method inherits both the advantages of arbitrary resolution sampling and the smoothness of parametric functions, as well as the strong expressiveness of discrete point-based functions. Empirical evaluations on the AFBench dataset demonstrate that FuncGenFoil improves upon state-of-the-art methods in airfoil generation by achieving a relative -74.4 label error reduction and +23.2 diversity increase on the AF-200K dataset. Our results highlight the advantages of function-space modeling for aerodynamic shape optimization, offering a powerful and flexible framework for high-fidelity airfoil design. Our code will be released.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of resource scheduling optimization in edge-cloud collaborative computing using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed DRL-based approach improves task processing efficiency, reduces overall processing time, enhances resource utilization, and effectively controls task migrations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DRL over traditional scheduling algorithms, particularly in managing complex task allocation, dynamic workloads, and multiple resource constraints. Despite its advantages, further improvements are needed to enhance learning efficiency, reduce training time, and address convergence issues. Future research should focus on increasing the algorithm's fault tolerance to handle more complex and uncertain scheduling scenarios, thereby advancing the intelligence and efficiency of edge-cloud computing systems.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of cloud computing infrastructure, energy consumption has become a critical challenge, driving the need for accurate and efficient prediction models. This study proposes a novel Vector Weighted Average Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (VWAA-KELM) model to enhance energy consumption prediction in cloud computing environments. By integrating a vector weighted average algorithm (VWAA) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), the proposed model dynamically adjusts feature weights and optimizes kernel functions, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VWAA-KELM: 94.7% of test set prediction errors fall within [0, 50] units, with only three cases exceeding 100 units, indicating strong stability. The model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987 in the training set (RMSE = 28.108, RPD = 8.872) and maintains excellent generalization with R2 = 0.973 in the test set (RMSE = 43.227, RPD = 6.202). Visual analysis confirms that predicted values closely align with actual energy consumption trends, avoiding overfitting while capturing nonlinear dependencies. A key innovation of this study is the introduction of adaptive feature weighting, allowing the model to dynamically assign importance to different input parameters, thereby enhancing high-dimensional data processing. This advancement provides a scalable and efficient approach for optimizing cloud data center energy consumption. Beyond cloud computing, the proposed hybrid framework has broader applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, supporting real-time energy management and intelligent resource allocation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well adopted paradigm of decentralized learning that allows training one model from multiple sources without the need to directly transfer data between participating clients. Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous sub-fields that deal with application-specific issues, be it data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), is dealing with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalized models. Although few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem is still largely unexplored, as its basic assumption and settings are slightly different from standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on the computation of cosine similarity between gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over thirty different tasks on three benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

Abstract: Domain Generalization aims to develop models that can generalize to novel and unseen data distributions. In this work, we study how model architectures and pre-training objectives impact feature richness and propose a method to effectively leverage them for domain generalization. Specifically, given a pre-trained feature space, we first discover latent domain structures, referred to as pseudo-domains, that capture domain-specific variations in an unsupervised manner. Next, we augment existing classifiers with these complementary pseudo-domain representations making them more amenable to diverse unseen test domains. We analyze how different pre-training feature spaces differ in the domain-specific variances they capture. Our empirical studies reveal that features from diffusion models excel at separating domains in the absence of explicit domain labels and capture nuanced domain-specific information. On 5 datasets, we show that our very simple framework improves generalization to unseen domains by a maximum test accuracy improvement of over 4% compared to the standard baseline Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Crucially, our method outperforms most algorithms that access domain labels during training.

Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.

Abstract: Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed the uncertain reward models to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, and thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that can directly learn the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM effectively models the rewards and uncertainties, and significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance compared with existing methods.

Abstract: Manual fruit harvesting is common in agriculture, but the amount of time pickers spend on non-productive activities can make it very inefficient. Accurately identifying picking vs. non-picking activity is crucial for estimating picker efficiency and optimising labour management and harvest processes. In this study, a practical system was developed to calculate the efficiency of pickers in commercial strawberry harvesting. Instrumented picking carts were developed to record the harvested fruit weight, geolocation, and cart movement in real time. These carts were deployed during the commercial strawberry harvest season in Santa Maria, CA. The collected data was then used to train a CNN-LSTM-based deep neural network to classify a picker's activity into "Pick" and "NoPick" classes. Experimental evaluations showed that the CNN-LSTM model showed promising activity recognition performance with an F1 score accuracy of over 0.97. The recognition results were then used to compute picker efficiency and the time required to fill a tray. Analysis of the season-long harvest data showed that the average picker efficiency was 75.07% with an estimation accuracy of 95.22%. Furthermore, the average tray fill time was 6.79 minutes with an estimation accuracy of 96.43%. When integrated into commercial harvesting, the proposed technology can aid growers in monitoring automated worker activity and optimising harvests to reduce non-productive time and enhance overall harvest efficiency.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamically optimizing numerical precision in the preconditioned conjugate gradient (CG) method. By modeling precision selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we employ Q-learning to adaptively assign precision levels to key operations, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy, while ensuring stability through double-precision scalar computations and residual computing. In practice, the algorithm is trained on a set of data and subsequently performs inference for precision selection on out-of-sample data, without requiring re-analysis or retraining for new datasets. This enables the method to adapt seamlessly to new problem instances without the computational overhead of recalibration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in enhancing solver's performance, marking the first application of RL to mixed-precision numerical methods. The findings highlight the approach's practical advantages, robustness, and scalability, providing valuable insights into its integration with iterative solvers and paving the way for AI-driven advancements in scientific computing.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the setting of Markov decision processes for a large number of exchangeable agents interacting in a mean field manner. Applications include, for example, the control of a large number of robots communicating through a central unit dispatching the optimal policy computed by maximizing an aggregate reward. An approximate solution is obtained by learning the optimal policy of a generic agent interacting with the statistical distribution of the states and actions of the other agents. We first provide a full analysis this discrete-time mean field control problem. We then rigorously prove the convergence of exact and model-free policy gradient methods in a mean-field linear-quadratic setting and establish bounds on the rates of convergence. We also provide graphical evidence of the convergence based on implementations of our algorithms.

<title>Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton: Accelerating Finite-Sum Minimization with Large Batches</title>

Abstract: Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as empirical risk minimization. Incorporating second-order information has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order methods. Yet, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm that provably accelerates existing stochastic Newton methods from $O(\alpha\log(1/\epsilon))$ to $O\big(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(n)}\big)$ passes over the data, i.e., by a factor of $O(\alpha\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of sum components and $\alpha$ is the approximation factor in the Hessian estimate. Surprisingly, this acceleration gets more significant the larger the data size $n$, which is a unique property of SVRN. Our algorithm retains the key advantages of Newton-type methods, such as easily parallelizable large-batch operations and a simple unit step size. We use SVRN to accelerate Subsampled Newton and Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms, and show that it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance~reduction.

<title>Prophet: Prompting Large Language Models with Complementary Answer Heuristics for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires external knowledge beyond the image to answer the question. Early studies retrieve required knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces irrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of their models. Recent works have resorted to using a powerful large language model (LLM) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for answering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue that they have not fully activated the capacity of the \emph{blind} LLM as the provided textual input is insufficient to depict the required visual information to answer the question. In this paper, we present Prophet -- a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework designed to prompt LLM with answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a specific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we extract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the VQA model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. The two types of answer heuristics are jointly encoded into a formatted prompt to facilitate the LLM's understanding of both the image and question, thus generating a more accurate answer. By incorporating the state-of-the-art LLM GPT-3, Prophet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on four challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets. Prophet is general that can be instantiated with the combinations of different VQA models (i.e., both discriminative and generative ones) and different LLMs (i.e., both commercial and open-source ones). Moreover, Prophet can also be integrated with modern large multimodal models in different stages, which is named Prophet++, to further improve the capabilities on knowledge-based VQA tasks.

<title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.

Abstract: In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work, which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and reduce the size of such networks.

<title>Twin Auto-Encoder Model for Learning Separable Representation in Cyberattack Detection</title>

Abstract: Representation learning (RL) methods for cyberattack detection face the diversity and sophistication of attack data, leading to the issue of mixed representations of different classes, particularly as the number of classes increases. To address this, the paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture/model called the Twin Auto-Encoder (TAE). TAE first maps the input data into latent space and then deterministically shifts data samples of different classes further apart to create separable data representations, referred to as representation targets. TAE's decoder then projects the input data into these representation targets. After training, TAE's decoder extracts data representations. TAE's representation target serves as a novel dynamic codeword, which refers to the vector that represents a specific class. This vector is updated after each training epoch for every data sample, in contrast to the conventional fixed codeword that does not incorporate information from the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse cybersecurity datasets, including seven IoT botnet datasets, two network IDS datasets, three malware datasets, one cloud DDoS dataset, and ten artificial datasets as the number of classes increases. TAE boosts accuracy and F-score in attack detection by around 2% compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 96.1% average accuracy in IoT attack detection. Additionally, TAE is well-suited for cybersecurity applications and potentially for IoT systems, with a model size of approximately 1 MB and an average running time of around 2.6E-07 seconds for extracting a data sample.

<title>Q-Newton: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling for Accelerating Neural Network Training with Newton's Gradient Descent</title>

Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.

<title>On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>

Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.

Abstract: Gold-standard sleep scoring is based on epoch-based assignment of sleep stages based on a combination of EEG, EOG and EMG signals. However, a polysomnographic recording consists of many other signals that could be used for sleep staging, including cardio-respiratory modalities. Leveraging this signal variety would offer important advantages, for example increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. We developed a deep generative model for automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any -arbitrary- combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model using a dataset of 1947 expert-labelled overnight recordings with 36 different signals, and achieved zero-shot inference on any sensor set by leveraging a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors. On single-channel EEG, the model reaches the performance limit in terms of polysomnography inter-rater agreement (5- class accuracy 85.6%, Cohen's kappa 0.791). Moreover, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set, for example finger photoplethysmography, nasal flow and thoracic respiratory movements, (5-class accuracy 79.0%, Cohen's kappa of 0.697), or even derivations very unconventional for sleep staging, such as tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Finally, our model allows for post- hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input instead of having to retrain from scratch on all inputs.

Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.

Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.

Abstract: In an era increasingly focused on green computing and explainable AI, revisiting traditional approaches in theoretical and phenomenological particle physics is paramount. This project evaluates various machine learning (ML) algorithms-including Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and XGBoost-alongside standard neural networks and a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for physics data analysis. We apply these techniques to a binary classification task that distinguishes the experimental viability of simulated scenarios based on Higgs observables and essential parameters. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to showcase the capabilities and computational efficiency of each model in binary classification tasks, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on integrating ML and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into physics research. In this study, XGBoost emerged as the preferred choice among the evaluated machine learning algorithms for its speed and effectiveness, especially in the initial stages of computation with limited datasets. However, while standard Neural Networks and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and adherence to physical laws, they require more computational time. These findings underscore the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model sophistication.

Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.

Abstract: Multi-document (MD) processing is crucial for LLMs to handle real-world tasks such as summarization and question-answering across large sets of documents. While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present unique difficulties, including management of inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. To address this challenge, we introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality synthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts. We also introduce MDCureRM, a cost-effective, MD-specific reward model to score and filter generated data based on their training utility for MD settings. MDCure is compatible with open- and closed-source models in addition to policy optimization methods such as PPO, enabling even small open-source models to surpass proprietary LLMs as strong generators of high-quality MD instruction data without further data filtering. With MDCure, we fine-tune a wide variety of LLMs up to 70B parameters in size from the FlanT5, Qwen2, and LLAMA3.1 model families. Extensive evaluations on a wide range of MD and long-context benchmarks spanning various tasks and domains show MDCure consistently improves performance over pre-trained baselines and base models by up to 75.1%. Our code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/yale-nlp/MDCure.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the \emph{value} of the largest mean among K distributions via samples from them (rather than estimating \emph{which} distribution has the largest mean), which arises from various machine learning tasks including Q-learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). While there have been a few proposed algorithms, their performance analyses have been limited to their biases rather than a precise error metric. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our analysis reveals that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects. First, HAVER estimates the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the identity of the best distribution and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps surprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better rates than this oracle when there are many distributions near the best one. Both of these improvements are the first of their kind in the literature, and we also prove that the naive algorithm that reports the largest empirical mean does not achieve these bounds. Finally, we confirm our theoretical findings via numerical experiments where we implement HAVER in bandit, Q-learning, and MCTS algorithms. In these experiments, HAVER consistently outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across different applications.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.

Abstract: We introduce the GEM (Generative Estimator for Mutual Information), an evaluation metric for assessing language generation by Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in generating informative judgments, without the need for a gold standard reference. GEM broadens the scenarios where we can benchmark LLM generation performance-from traditional ones, like machine translation and summarization, where gold standard references are readily available, to subjective tasks without clear gold standards, such as academic peer review.
  GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidate and reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard. In experiments on a human-annotated dataset, GEM demonstrates competitive correlations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4o Examiner, and outperforms all other baselines. Additionally, GEM is more robust against strategic manipulations, such as rephrasing or elongation, which can artificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner.
  We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) which evaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviews for academic research papers. Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inherits its robustness properties. Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents data contamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of new open-access research papers and peer reviews each year. We show GRE-bench results of various popular LLMs on their peer review capabilities using the ICLR2023 dataset.

<title>Optimal Oblivious Subspace Embeddings with Near-optimal Sparsity</title>

Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.

<title>Efficient Depth Estimation for Unstable Stereo Camera Systems on AR Glasses</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10013</link>

arXiv:2411.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is a fundamental component in augmented reality (AR), which requires low latency for real-time processing. However, preprocessing such as rectification and non-ML computations such as cost volume require significant amount of latency exceeding that of an ML model itself, which hinders the real-time processing required by AR. Therefore, we develop alternative approaches to the rectification and cost volume that consider ML acceleration (GPU and NPUs) in recent hardware. For pre-processing, we eliminate it by introducing homography matrix prediction network with a rectification positional encoding (RPE), which delivers both low latency and robustness to unrectified images. For cost volume, we replace it with a group-pointwise convolution-based operator and approximation of cosine similarity based on layernorm and dot product. Based on our approaches, we develop MultiHeadDepth (replacing cost volume) and HomoDepth (MultiHeadDepth + removing pre-processing) models. MultiHeadDepth provides 11.8-30.3% improvements in accuracy and 22.9-25.2% reduction in latency compared to a state-of-the-art depth estimation model for AR glasses from industry. HomoDepth, which can directly process unrectified images, reduces the end-to-end latency by 44.5%. We also introduce a multi-task learning method to handle misaligned stereo inputs on HomoDepth, which reduces the AbsRel error by 10.0-24.3%. The overall results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches, which not only reduce the inference latency but also improve the model performance.

<title>Omni-IML: Towards Unified Image Manipulation Localization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.14823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods mostly rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on the target IML task, while joint training on multiple IML tasks causes significant performance degradation, hindering real applications.
  To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model designed to unify IML across diverse tasks.
  Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalization through three key components: (1) a Modal Gate Encoder, which adaptively selects the optimal encoding modality per sample, (2) a Dynamic Weight Decoder, which dynamically adjusts decoder filters to the task at hand, and (3) an Anomaly Enhancement module that leverages box supervision to highlight the tampered regions and facilitate the learning of task-agnostic features.
  Beyond localization, to support interpretation of the tampered images, we construct Omni-273k, a large high-quality dataset that includes natural language descriptions of tampered artifact. It is annotated through our automatic, chain-of-thoughts annotation technique.
  We also design a simple-yet-effective interpretation module to better utilize these descriptive annotations.
  Our extensive experiments show that our single Omni-IML model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four major IML tasks, providing a valuable solution for practical deployment and a promising direction of generalist models in image forensics. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.

<title>Empirical Bayes Estimation for Lasso-Type Regularizers: Analysis of Automatic Relevance Determination</title>

arXiv:2501.11280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.

arXiv:2501.14246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies demonstrate that specific areas of the brain are connected to human emotional responses, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments conducted on SEED, SEED-IV and MPED datasets indicate that our method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent decades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes are susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant seems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two prevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these diseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal solution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders. Here, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine learning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed method comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed using a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3) feature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4) classification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550 features.

Abstract: Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.

arXiv:2502.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning an agent model behaving like humans, which can jointly perceive, predict, and act in egocentric worlds. Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, which prevents them from learning from each other. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions within a single transformer. EgoAgent introduces two innovations to learn from the causal and temporally intertwined nature of these abilities: (1) Interleaved sequential modeling of states and actions with the causal attention mechanism, and (2) A joint embedding-action-prediction architecture featuring temporal asymmetric predictor-observer branches. Integrating these designs based on JEPA, EgoAgent unifies these capabilities in a cohesive learning framework. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field. Our demo can be viewed at https://landiff.github.io/.

Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.

Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.

Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) has widespread applications in industrial automation. Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely 19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size boxes.

Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon sequestration, making it essential for sustainable land management and climate change mitigation. However, large-scale SOC monitoring remains challenging due to spatial variability, temporal dynamics, and multiple influencing factors. We present WALGREEN, a platform that enhances SOC inference by overcoming limitations of current applications. Leveraging machine learning and diverse soil samples, WALGREEN generates predictive models using historical public and private data. Built on cloud-based technologies, it offers a user-friendly interface for researchers, policymakers, and land managers to access carbon data, analyze trends, and support evidence-based decision-making. Implemented in Python, Java, and JavaScript, WALGREEN integrates Google Earth Engine and Sentinel Copernicus via scripting, OpenLayers, and Thymeleaf in a Model-View-Controller framework. This paper aims to advance soil science, promote sustainable agriculture, and drive critical ecosystem responses to climate change.

Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction plays a pivotal role in deciphering cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address the limitations of traditional experimental methods and existing computational approaches in cross-modal feature fusion and false-negative suppression, we propose SCMPPI-a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework. By effectively integrating sequence-based features (AAC, DPC, ESMC-CKSAAP) with network topology (Node2Vec embeddings) and incorporating an enhanced contrastive learning strategy with negative sample filtering, SCMPPI achieves superior prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy(98.13%) and AUC(99.69%), along with excellent cross-species generalization (AUC>99%). Successful applications in CD9 networks, Wnt pathway analysis, and cancer-specific networks further highlight its potential for disease target discovery, establishing SCMPPI as a powerful tool for multimodal biological data analysis.

Summary: <br />
The paper addresses the increasing fraudulent activities in various domains by proposing a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection using Spatial Graph Neural Networks. Current GNN-based methods face limitations in disrupting the graph topology and increasing prediction uncertainty by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. DHMP overcomes these limitations by leveraging a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, applying shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently, and incorporating a customized sampling strategy for training. This adaptive approach allows nodes to balance signal contributions based on their labels, leading to improved fraud detection performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DHMP over existing methods, emphasizing the significance of separating signals with different frequencies for enhanced fraud detection. <div>

Abstract: Fraudulent activities have significantly increased across various domains, such as e-commerce, online review platforms, and social networks, making fraud detection a critical task. Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to fraud detection tasks due to their strong inductive learning capabilities. However, existing spatial GNN-based methods often enhance the graph structure by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing to align with the homophilic bias of GNNs. Unfortunately, this approach can disrupt the original graph topology and increase uncertainty in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection. DHMP leverages a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating the low-pass inductive bias of traditional GNNs. It then applies shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and incorporates a customized sampling strategy for training. This allows nodes to adaptively balance the contributions of various signals based on their labels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DHMP outperforms existing methods, highlighting the importance of separating signals with different frequencies for improved fraud detection.

Summary: 
This paper takes a data-centric perspective on learning theory, focusing on optimizing training data rather than algorithms. The study explores the performance of a learning rule when trained on a limited number of selected data points from a larger population. It investigates the ability to achieve comparable performance by selecting fewer data points, particularly in mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. The research also delves into error rates in binary classification and stochastic convex optimization, providing insights into optimal data selection bounds. The findings contribute to understanding how data selection impacts learning outcomes and offer insights for future research directions.  <br /> <div>

Abstract: Learning theory has traditionally followed a model-centric approach, focusing on designing optimal algorithms for a fixed natural learning task (e.g., linear classification or regression). In this paper, we adopt a complementary data-centric perspective, whereby we fix a natural learning rule and focus on optimizing the training data. Specifically, we study the following question: given a learning rule $\mathcal{A}$ and a data selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform when trained on at most $n$ data points selected from a population of $N$ points? We investigate when it is possible to select $n \ll N$ points and achieve performance comparable to training on the entire population.
  We address this question across a variety of empirical risk minimizers. Our results include optimal data-selection bounds for mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. Additionally, we establish two general results: a taxonomy of error rates in binary classification and in stochastic convex optimization. Finally, we propose several open questions and directions for future research.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning faces challenges in designing effective reward functions, especially for complex tasks in unstructured environments. While traditional approaches rely on human comparative feedback, this study explores multi-level human feedback in the form of episode scores. This type of feedback offers more informative signals about the reward function and can handle non-Markovian rewards. The proposed algorithm efficiently learns both the reward function and the optimal policy from this feedback, achieving sublinear regret. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's empirical effectiveness in learning from multi-level human feedback.

Abstract: Designing an effective reward function has long been a challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly for complex tasks in unstructured environments. To address this, various learning paradigms have emerged that leverage different forms of human input to specify or refine the reward function. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a prominent approach that utilizes human comparative feedback, expressed as a preference for one behavior over another, to tackle this problem. In contrast to comparative feedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided in the form of a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers more coarse but informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary feedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on the evaluation of an entire episode. We propose an algorithm to efficiently learn both the reward function and the optimal policy from this form of feedback. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through extensive simulations.

<div> neural networks, backpropagation algorithm, Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), biological plausibility, alternative learning approaches

Summary:
The study introduces Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA) as a biologically inspired alternative to the backpropagation algorithm for training artificial neural networks. EDLA eliminates the need for layer-wise backpropagation by diffusing a global error signal throughout paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers. Experimental results demonstrate that EDLA networks achieve high accuracy in tasks such as parity check, regression, and image classification, with performance influenced by factors like learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Additionally, EDLA networks show the ability to extract meaningful features, akin to traditional neural networks. These findings suggest EDLA as a promising alternative for training feedforward networks and advocate for further exploration of its application to biologically inspired neural networks.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Text2SQL, Reasoning capabilities, Reinforcement Learning, Benchmark datasets <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the impact of reasoning capabilities on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in translating natural language questions into SQL queries, particularly in complex scenarios involving multiple tables and intricate patterns. Various training strategies, including Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with reasoning traces, Reinforcement Learning (RL) with different rewarding functions, and a combination of SFT and RL, were compared across four benchmark datasets. The results indicate that general-purpose reasoning in ZSL is not effective for complex Text2SQL tasks, while small LLMs benefit more from SFT with reasoning. RL shows overall benefits, especially when employing fine-grained metrics as rewards. The findings suggest that with RL and innovative text2SQL rewards, smaller LLMs can achieve comparable performance to much larger models on challenging datasets like Bird. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensates for the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, exploring the use of different rewarding functions, both the established EXecution accuracy (EX) and a mix with fine-grained ones that also account the precision, recall, and cardinality of partially correct answers; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets. The use of the fine-grained metrics turns out to be the most effective RL strategy. Thanks to RL and the novel text2SQL rewards, the 7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 400+ Billion ones (including gpt-4o) on the Bird dataset.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs. While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.

<div> Neural Networks, Adversarial Robustness, Evaluation Metric, Robustness Difference Index, Clustering Features
Summary:<br /><br />Deep neural networks (DNNs) are prone to adversarial samples, leading to concerns about their reliability in critical tasks. Current methods for assessing adversarial robustness are time-consuming or complex. To address this, a new metric called Robustness Difference Index (RDI) based on sample clustering features is proposed. RDI quantifies model robustness by analyzing feature vector distances across the decision boundary. It is attack-independent and computationally efficient, showing high correlation with standard metrics like attack success rate (ASR). RDI's average computation time is significantly lower compared to existing methods using the PGD attack. The open-source code for RDI is available at the provided link. <div>
arXiv:2504.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently, methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming, while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based on sample clustering features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD attack. Our open-source code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDI-B1DA.

Summary: 
This study explores utilizing the internal memory of deep learning models, specifically large Transformers like Gemma 3, for wildfire occurrence prediction. A modular architecture is introduced, customizing the input and output networks while freezing the pretrained Transformer layers to prevent overfitting. By transforming tabular wildfire data into the required format for Gemma 3's mid-layer Transformer blocks, the model achieves improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to standard baselines. Ablation studies confirm the consistent contribution of frozen Transformer layers to better representations, highlighting the potential for reusing large-model mid-layers as a learned internal world. This approach enables more data-efficient and interpretable solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk management. <div>
arXiv:2504.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models, especially large Transformers, carry substantial "memory" in their intermediate layers -- an \emph{internal world} that encodes a wealth of relational and contextual knowledge. This work harnesses that internal world for wildfire occurrence prediction by introducing a modular architecture built upon Gemma 3, a state-of-the-art multimodal model. Rather than relying on Gemma 3's original embedding and positional encoding stacks, we develop a custom feed-forward module that transforms tabular wildfire features into the hidden dimension required by Gemma 3's mid-layer Transformer blocks. We freeze these Gemma 3 sub-layers -- thus preserving their pretrained representation power -- while training only the smaller input and output networks. This approach minimizes the number of trainable parameters and reduces the risk of overfitting on limited wildfire data, yet retains the benefits of Gemma 3's broad knowledge. Evaluations on a Moroccan wildfire dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to standard feed-forward and convolutional baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the frozen Transformer layers consistently contribute to better representations, underscoring the feasibility of reusing large-model mid-layers as a learned internal world. Our findings suggest that strategic modular reuse of pretrained Transformers can enable more data-efficient and interpretable solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk management.

<div> Keywords: SSMs, in-context retrieval, Transformer-based language models, Gather-and-Aggregate mechanism, attention components  
Summary: 
SSMs and Transformer-based language models both utilize a Gather-and-Aggregate (G&amp;A) mechanism for in-context retrieval. This mechanism involves Gather Heads extracting relevant information and Aggregate Heads integrating it for a final representation, critical for various tasks. The concentration of G&amp;A in a few heads shows their importance as bottlenecks. Disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head can drastically reduce model performance on tasks like MMLU. While SSMs struggle with in-context retrieval due to smoother attention patterns, hybrid models can leverage attention components for retrieval tasks. The study suggests potential ways to combine the strengths of Transformers and SSMs, such as incorporating attention-based variants in pure SSM models for improved retrieval performance. The findings highlight the significance of G&amp;A mechanisms in model performance and suggest avenues for enhancing model capabilities.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SSMs offer efficient processing of long sequences with fixed state sizes, but struggle with algorithmic tasks like retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&amp;A) mechanism. A Gather Head first identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model types, G&amp;A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example, disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar G&amp;A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the significance of G&amp;A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs manifest in how they implement G&amp;A, leading to smoother attention patterns rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&amp;A relies on. Thus, while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example, in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&amp;A head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.

Summary:
The study aims to develop machine learning models for predicting emergency department (ED) waiting room occupancy at two time scales: hourly and daily. By forecasting waiting counts ahead of time, these models can assist in resource planning and improve hospital efficiency. Using data from a hospital in the southeastern United States, eleven machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated. The TSiTPlus model performed best for hourly predictions, while the XCMPlus model was most accurate for daily predictions. The models showed varying accuracy across different hours and patient volumes. Implementing these predictive models could help hospitals make proactive staffing decisions and intervene earlier to reduce overcrowding in emergency care settings. <div>
arXiv:2504.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding remains a major challenge, causing delays in care and increased operational strain. Hospital management often reacts to congestion after it occurs. Machine learning predictive modeling offers a proactive approach by forecasting patient flow metrics, such as waiting count, to improve resource planning and hospital efficiency.
  Objective: This study develops machine learning models to predict ED waiting room occupancy at two time scales. The hourly model forecasts the waiting count six hours ahead (e.g., a 1 PM prediction for 7 PM), while the daily model estimates the average waiting count for the next 24 hours (e.g., a 5 PM prediction for the following day's average). These tools support staffing decisions and enable earlier interventions to reduce overcrowding.
  Methods: Data from a partner hospital's ED in the southeastern United States were used, integrating internal metrics and external features. Eleven machine learning algorithms, including traditional and deep learning models, were trained and evaluated. Feature combinations were optimized, and performance was assessed across varying patient volumes and hours.
  Results: TSiTPlus achieved the best hourly prediction (MAE: 4.19, MSE: 29.32). The mean hourly waiting count was 18.11, with a standard deviation of 9.77. Accuracy varied by hour, with MAEs ranging from 2.45 (11 PM) to 5.45 (8 PM). Extreme case analysis at one, two, and three standard deviations above the mean showed MAEs of 6.16, 10.16, and 15.59, respectively. For daily predictions, XCMPlus performed best (MAE: 2.00, MSE: 6.64), with a daily mean of 18.11 and standard deviation of 4.51.
  Conclusions: These models accurately forecast ED waiting room occupancy and support proactive resource allocation. Their implementation has the potential to improve patient flow and reduce overcrowding in emergency care settings.

ZipR1 is a new RL-based post-training method designed to encourage token sparsity in well-posed MLLMs, aiming to reduce computational overhead while maintaining model performance. This method treats the token reduction ratio as the efficiency reward and answer accuracy as the performance reward, optimizing the inference-consistent efficiency-performance tradeoff. Experimental results show that ZipR1 can effectively reduce the token ratio of Qwen2/2.5-VL from 80% to 25% across 13 image and video benchmarks, with only minimal accuracy reduction.

arXiv:2504.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead by selectively processing a subset of salient tokens while preserving model performance. Despite the effectiveness of such designs, how to actively encourage token sparsity of well-posed MLLMs remains under-explored, which fundamentally limits the achievable acceleration effect during inference. In this paper, we propose a simple RL-based post-training method named \textbf{ZipR1} that treats the token reduction ratio as the efficiency reward and answer accuracy as the performance reward.
  In this way, our method can jointly alleviate the computation and memory bottlenecks via directly optimizing the inference-consistent efficiency-performance tradeoff. Experimental results demonstrate that ZipR1 can reduce the token ratio of Qwen2/2.5-VL from 80\% to 25\% with a minimal accuracy reduction on 13 image and video benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA) as a method for merging model checkpoints in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The study explores weighting parameters based on performance metrics such as training loss and training steps to improve model performance. By using a formula with a penalty factor to adjust weight distribution, MWA requires only one hyperparameter regardless of the number of checkpoints. Experiments on three fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that MWA consistently outperforms the naive uniform average of checkpoints. Loss-weighted merging, in particular, results in up to 5% higher task accuracy compared to the baseline uniform merge and even surpasses the performance of individual checkpoints. These findings validate the effectiveness of checkpoint merging for PEFT and emphasize the importance of using metric-driven weighting heuristics to enhance model performance efficiently. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Checkpoint merging is a technique for combining multiple model snapshots into a single superior model, potentially reducing training time for large language models. This paper explores checkpoint merging in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), where only small adapter modules (e.g. LoRA) are trained. We propose Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA), a simple yet effective method to merge model checkpoints by weighting their parameters according to performance metrics. In particular, we investigate weighting by training loss and by training steps, under the intuition that lower-loss or later-step checkpoints are more valuable. We introduce a formula with a penalty factor to adjust weight distribution, requiring only one hyperparameter regardless of the number of checkpoints. Experiments on three fine-tuning tasks (mathematical reasoning, preference alignment, and general instruction tuning) show that MWA consistently produces merged models that outperform the naive uniform average of checkpoints. Notably, loss-weighted merging often yields the best results, delivering up to 5% higher task accuracy than the baseline uniform merge and even surpassing the final individual checkpoint's performance. These findings validate checkpoint merging for PEFT and demonstrate that a metric-driven weighting heuristic can efficiently boost model performance with minimal computational overhead.

<br />  
Summary:  
PARallel Draft (PARD) is a novel speculative decoding method designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass. It introduces a conditional drop token method to accelerate training, leading to a 3x improvement in draft model training efficiency. PARD's target-independence property allows easy adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models across various model sizes, minimizing adaptation costs. By optimizing the inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x, achieving 311.5 tokens per second. <div>
arXiv:2504.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x.

Abstract: Recently, foundation models such as OpenAI's O1 and O3, along with DeepSeek's R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capacities and problem-solving skills acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), with wide applications in mathematics, coding, science, intelligent agents, and virtual assistants. In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover, models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Dynamic quality of service, User-service interactions, Snowflake Factorization, Tensor model, Missing QoS data prediction

Summary:
The article introduces a novel Non-negative Snowflake Factorization of tensors model to predict unobserved Quality of Service (QoS) data in user-service interactions. The model utilizes a snowflake core tensor to enhance learning capabilities and employs a Single Latent Factor-based, Nonnegative Multiplication Update on Tensor (SLF-NMUT) for parameter learning. Through empirical results, it is shown that the proposed model accurately learns dynamic user-service interaction patterns and provides improved predictions for missing QoS data. The rich temporal patterns in user behavior and service conditions are effectively captured, aiding in a comprehensive understanding of user choices and service performance in Web services. The model's ability to handle a large amount of unobserved QoS data contributes to a more accurate prediction of user preferences and service conditions, ultimately improving the overall user experience.

Abstract: Dynamic quality of service (QoS) data exhibit rich temporal patterns in user-service interactions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and service conditions in Web service. As the number of users and services increases, there is a large amount of unobserved QoS data, which significantly affects users'choice of services. To predict unobserved QoS data, we propose a Non-negative Snowflake Factorization of tensors model. This method designs a snowflake core tensor to enhance the model's learning capability. Additionally, it employs a single latent factor-based, nonnegative multiplication update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) for parameter learning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately learns dynamic user-service interaction patterns, thereby yielding improved predictions for missing QoS data.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful, discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries. Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art graph based, operator learning, and neural field methods. Notably, our method supports real time inference and zero-shot super-resolution, enabling efficient training on low-resolution meshes while maintaining high accuracy on full-scale discretizations.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on transfer-based black-box attacks where adversarial samples from a single surrogate model are used on target models. Existing methods often have lower Attack Success Rates in targeted attacks as the adversarial examples overfit the surrogate model. The proposed method, Mitigate perturbation Co-adaptation by DropConnect (MCD), enhances transferability by creating diverse variants of the surrogate model. Extensive experiments on CNN- and Transformer-based models demonstrate MCD's effectiveness, achieving 13% higher average ASRs when transferring from a CNN-based to Transformer-based models. MCD enhances self-ensemble methods by introducing more diversification across variants while preserving semantic information. Moreover, MCD shows significant performance gains when scaling the compute for crafting adversarial examples.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of transfer-based black-box attack, where adversarial samples generated using a single surrogate model are directly applied to target models. Compared with untargeted attacks, existing methods still have lower Attack Success Rates (ASRs) in the targeted setting, i.e., the obtained adversarial examples often overfit the surrogate model but fail to mislead other models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the pixels or features in these adversarial examples collaborate in a highly dependent manner to maximize the success of an adversarial attack on the surrogate model, which we refer to as perturbation co-adaptation. Then, we propose to Mitigate perturbation Co-adaptation by DropConnect (MCD) to enhance transferability, by creating diverse variants of surrogate model at each optimization iteration. We conduct extensive experiments across various CNN- and Transformer-based models to demonstrate the effectiveness of MCD. In the challenging scenario of transferring from a CNN-based model to Transformer-based models, MCD achieves 13% higher average ASRs compared with state-of-the-art baselines. MCD boosts the performance of self-ensemble methods by bringing in more diversification across the variants while reserving sufficient semantic information for each variant. In addition, MCD attains the highest performance gain when scaling the compute of crafting adversarial examples.

Abstract: Environmental biotechnologies, such as drinking water biofilters, rely on complex interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding physical-chemical environments. Predicting the performance of these systems is challenging due to high-dimensional, sparse datasets that lack diversity and fail to fully capture system behaviour. Accurate predictive models require innovative, science-guided approaches. In this study, we present the first application of Buckingham Pi theory to modelling biofilter performance. This dimensionality reduction technique identifies meaningful, dimensionless variables that enhance predictive accuracy and improve model interpretability. Using these variables, we developed the Environmental Buckingham Pi Neural Network (EnviroPiNet), a physics-guided model benchmarked against traditional data-driven methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoder neural networks. Our findings demonstrate that the EnviroPiNet model achieves an R^2 value of 0.9236 on the testing dataset, significantly outperforming PCA and autoencoder methods. The Buckingham Pi variables also provide insights into the physical and chemical relationships governing biofilter behaviour, with implications for system design and optimization. This study highlights the potential of combining physical principles with AI approaches to model complex environmental systems characterized by sparse, high-dimensional datasets.

<div> HTM, SPRT, data drift detection, anomaly identification, multidimensional supervised scenario 
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to detecting and controlling data drift using a hybrid framework of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The proposed method eliminates the need for frequent retraining and offers low false positive rates, outperforming traditional techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index. Furthermore, the study explores the application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenarios for anomaly detection by combining outputs through a neural network. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the hybrid framework, providing valuable insights for real-time deployment, particularly in domains such as Telecom. <div>
arXiv:2504.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.

Summary:
The Xeno-Canto bird audio repository is a vital resource for studying bird vocalizations worldwide. However, extracting labeled datasets from this repository for machine learning faces challenges due to label noise from non-target sounds. To address this, a cleaning process involving audio preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised outlier detection was proposed. Different neural network dimensionality reduction techniques were applied, with varying effectiveness across bird species datasets. The study showed that the cleaning process can reduce label noise but performance varies among species. This research highlights the importance of addressing label noise in bird species datasets sourced from Xeno-Canto recordings for enhancing machine learning models' accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Xeno-Canto bird audio repository is an invaluable resource for those interested in vocalizations and other sounds made by birds around the world. This is particularly the case for machine learning researchers attempting to improve on the bird species recognition accuracy of classification models. However, the task of extracting labeled datasets from the recordings found in this crowd-sourced repository faces several challenges. One challenge of particular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird species label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds are also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds, anthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds can result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In this work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) to reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We investigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two flavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE (Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at detecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant variation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next. We believe that the results of this investigation demonstrate that the application of our cleaning process can meaningfully reduce the label noise of bird species datasets derived from Xeno-Canto audio repository but results vary across species.

Summary:
Autoencoder models based on LSTM and CNN were developed to reconstruct topographic sequences from ICESat-2 data and derive embeddings. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was then applied to visualize the embeddings, showing that they preserved the overall structure but generated more compact clusters compared to the original ICESat-2 data. This indicates the potential of embeddings to reduce the number of required labeled samples for machine learning tasks on ICESat-2 data. The study aimed to address the limitations of supervised learning methods that rely heavily on manually collected labels, which require significant time and effort. By exploring the use of unsupervised autoencoders on unlabeled data, the researchers were able to generate meaningful embeddings that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning tasks utilizing ICESat-2 data. <div>

Abstract: The Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides high-resolution measurements of sea ice height. Recent studies have developed machine learning methods on ICESat-2 data, primarily focusing on surface type classification. However, the heavy reliance on manually collected labels requires significant time and effort for supervised learning, as it involves cross-referencing track measurements with overlapping background optical imagery. Additionally, the coincidence of ICESat-2 tracks with background images is relatively rare due to the different overpass patterns and atmospheric conditions. To address these limitations, this study explores the potential of unsupervised autoencoder on unlabeled data to derive latent embeddings. We develop autoencoder models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to reconstruct topographic sequences from ICESat-2 and derive embeddings. We then apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce dimensions and visualize the embeddings. Our results show that embeddings from autoencoders preserve the overall structure but generate relatively more compact clusters compared to the original ICESat-2 data, indicating the potential of embeddings to lessen the number of required labels samples.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel non-parametric approach for estimating multivariate probability density functions using minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Traditional density estimators, such as histograms, struggle with capturing complex and nonuniform distributions accurately. The proposed method addresses this issue by leveraging tensor factorization techniques, specifically the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. By utilizing MDL-based binning and quantile cuts, the method is able to capture local variations and multimodal patterns effectively. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic data and a real dry bean classification dataset. This new approach shows promise for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This study addresses the challenge of learning from a small number of labeled vertices in graph data without a class oracle. Three experiments were conducted where assumptions were gradually relaxed. The results showed that prototypical models outperformed discriminative models when there were fewer than 20 samples per class. The performance of Graph Convolutional Networks decreased by 9% when the class oracle assumption was dropped, while prototypical networks only lost 1% on average. In the experiment where the number and distribution of classes were unknown, both models saw a further decrease in performance by 1%. This highlights the effectiveness of prototypical models in few-shot learning tasks in graph data when limited labeled data is available.  <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ample availability of graph data, obtaining vertex labels is a tedious and expensive task. Therefore, it is desirable to learn from a few labeled vertices only. Existing few-shot learners assume a class oracle, which provides labeled vertices for a desired class. However, such an oracle is not available in a real-world setting, i.e., when drawing a vertex for labeling it is unknown to which class the vertex belongs. Few-shot learners are often combined with prototypical networks, while classical semi-supervised vertex classification uses discriminative models, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In this paper, we train our models by iteratively prompting a human annotator with vertices to annotate. We perform three experiments where we continually relax our assumptions. First, we assume a class oracle, i.e., the human annotator is provided with an equal number of vertices to label for each class. We denote this as "Balanced Sampling''. In the subsequent experiment, "Unbalanced Sampling,'' we replace the class oracle with $k$-medoids clustering and draw vertices to label from the clusters. In the last experiment, the "Unknown Number of Classes,'' we no longer assumed we knew the number and distribution of classes. Our results show that prototypical models outperform discriminative models in all experiments when fewer than $20$ samples per class are available. While dropping the assumption of the class oracle for the "Unbalanced Sampling'' experiment reduces the performance of the GCN by $9\%$, the prototypical network loses only $1\%$ on average. For the "Unknown Number of Classes'' experiment, the average performance for both models decreased further by $1\%$.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed weather forecasting by improving both its accuracy and computational efficiency. However, before any forecast can begin, weather centers must identify the current atmospheric state from vast amounts of observational data. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model producing global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25-degree resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 1.5B-parameter spatio-temporal latent diffusion model trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, Appa can be conditioned on any type of observations to infer the posterior distribution of plausible state trajectories, without retraining. Our unified probabilistic framework flexibly tackles multiple inference tasks -- reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting -- using the same model, eliminating the need for task-specific architectures or training procedures. Experiments demonstrate physical consistency on a global scale and good reconstructions from observations, while showing competitive forecasting skills. Our results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.

Abstract: The Design2Code problem, which involves converting digital designs into functional source code, is a significant challenge in software development due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Traditional approaches often struggle with accurately interpreting the intricate visual details and structural relationships inherent in webpage designs, leading to limitations in automation and efficiency.

The article introduces TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method for efficient parameter adaptation in large language models. TLoRA decomposes weight updates into three matrices, leveraging two fixed random matrices and one trainable matrix along with layer-wise scaling factors to achieve comparable performance to existing methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters.

arXiv:2504.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor. This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates, underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior. Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient model adaptation.

<title>Non-Asymptotic Guarantees for Average-Reward Q-Learning with Adaptive Stepsizes</title>

<div> Keywords: Q-learning, asynchronous implementation, adaptive stepsizes, stochastic approximation, convergence rate <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This work introduces a novel finite-time analysis for the convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. The algorithm utilizes adaptive stepsizes as local clocks for each state-action pair, enabling a rate of convergence of O(1/k) to the optimal relative Q-function. By incorporating a centering step, pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function is achieved at the same rate. The necessity of adaptive stepsizes is highlighted, as they counteract asynchronous updates and serve as implicit importance sampling. The algorithm is seen as a non-Markovian stochastic approximation scheme due to strong correlations introduced by adaptive stepsizes. Approaches to address this challenge involve a time-inhomogeneous Markovian reformulation and a combination of time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain concentration inequalities to mitigate correlations. The tools developed in this study can have broad applications in analyzing stochastic approximation algorithms with adaptive stepsizes. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A key feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which serve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates generated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the mean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm. Moreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function, also at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive stepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to the correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a form of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of asynchronous updates.
  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update depend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making the algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our approach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous Markovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of almost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain concentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the adaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are likely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with adaptive stepsizes.

<div> Keywords: link prediction, dynamic graph learning, graph neural networks, common neighbor interaction, message passing scheme 

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach called High-order Graph Neural Networks with Common Neighbor Awareness (HGNN-CNA) for improving link prediction in dynamic graph learning (DGL). The proposed model addresses the limitation of traditional dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) by incorporating multi-hop common neighbors to capture complex node interactions. By fusing correlation scores from common neighbors into the message-passing process, the HGNN-CNA directly considers common neighbor interactions in DGL. Experimental results on real dynamic graphs show that HGNN-CNA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in link prediction accuracy. This highlights the significance of considering common neighbor interactions in dynamic graph learning tasks for improved performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in dynamic graph learning (DGL), inherently shaped by the topology of the DG. Recent advancements in dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN), primarily by modeling the relationships among nodes via a message passing scheme, have significantly improved link prediction performance. However, DGNNs heavily rely on the pairwise node interactions, which neglect the common neighbor interaction in DGL. To address this limitation, we propose a High-order Graph Neural Networks with Common Neighbor Awareness (HGNN-CNA) for link prediction with two-fold ideas: a) estimating correlation score by considering multi-hop common neighbors for capturing the complex interaction between nodes; b) fusing the correlation into the message-passing process to consider common neighbor interaction directly in DGL. Experimental results on three real DGs demonstrate that the proposed HGNN-CNA acquires a significant accuracy gain over several state-of-the-art models on the link prediction task.

Summary:
Dynamic Action Interpolation (DAI) is a new framework proposed to address the sample inefficiency issue in reinforcement learning (RL). It integrates expert and RL actions using a time-varying weight $\alpha(t)$ without the need for complex architectural modifications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that DAI accelerates value function learning while ensuring convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations on MuJoCo continuous control tasks show significant improvements in both early-stage and final performance, with performance gains of over 160% on average and more than 50% respectively. Notably, the Humanoid task exhibits a 4x improvement in early performance and a 2x gain at convergence. These results challenge the conventional wisdom that intricate architectural changes are essential for achieving sample-efficient RL. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from severe sample inefficiency, especially during early training, requiring extensive environmental interactions to perform competently. Existing methods tend to solve this by incorporating prior knowledge, but introduce significant architectural and implementation complexity. We propose Dynamic Action Interpolation (DAI), a universal yet straightforward framework that interpolates expert and RL actions via a time-varying weight $\alpha(t)$, integrating into any Actor-Critic algorithm with just a few lines of code and without auxiliary networks or additional losses. Our theoretical analysis shows that DAI reshapes state visitation distributions to accelerate value function learning while preserving convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations across MuJoCo continuous control tasks demonstrate that DAI improves early-stage performance by over 160\% on average and final performance by more than 50\%, with the Humanoid task showing a 4$\times$ improvement early on and a 2$\times$ gain at convergence. These results challenge the assumption that complex architectural modifications are necessary for sample-efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Methods based on implicit neural representation have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) tasks, but they neglect the potential value of the frequency domain, leading to sub-optimal performance. We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency. FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA) captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Visual feature map proves the superiority of FIM in enriching detail characterization. Frequency error map validates IISA productively improve the frequency fidelity. Local attribution map validates FCSA effectively captures global context.

Summary:
This paper presents a method to enforce stationary behavior in AI models while preserving trend and seasonal patterns in non-stationary data. By utilizing techniques such as Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), trend and seasonal information crucial for learning temporal dependencies are embedded in the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The proposed method was tested on two non-stationary time-series datasets, and four deep learning models trained on the resulting latent vectors demonstrated competitive predictive performance compared to existing techniques using RMSE as the evaluation metric. This approach offers a solution to the limitations of traditional models that require a stationary training environment and highlights the importance of preserving trend and seasonal information for accurate predictive tasks in dynamic systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models have garnered significant research attention towards predictive task automation. However, a stationary training environment is an underlying assumption for most models and such models simply do not work on non-stationary data since a stationary relationship is learned. The existing solutions propose making data stationary prior to model training and evaluation. This leads to loss of trend and seasonal patterns which are vital components for learning temporal dependencies of the system under study. This research aims to address this limitation by proposing a method for enforcing stationary behaviour within the latent space while preserving trend and seasonal information. The method deploys techniques including Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), to learn information vital for efficient approximation of trend and seasonal information which is then stored as embeddings within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The approach's ability to preserve trend and seasonal information was evaluated on two time-series non-stationary datasets. For predictive performance evaluation, four deep learning models were trained on the latent vector representations of the datasets after application of the proposed method and all models produced competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques using RMSE as the performance metric.

However, the lack of uncertainty quantification in DL models poses challenges for reliability. This paper introduces Interval Neural Networks (INNs) for incorporating uncertainty quantification in SysID tasks.

A DL framework is proposed for training INNs, integrating a UQ loss function and parameterization tricks to handle interval parameter constraints. The concept of "elasticity" for underlying uncertainty causes is introduced, and ILSTM and INODE architectures are validated through SysID experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness. <br /> <div>

Abstract: System Identification (SysID) is crucial for modeling and understanding dynamical systems using experimental data. While traditional SysID methods emphasize linear models, their inability to fully capture nonlinear dynamics has driven the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) as a more powerful alternative. However, the lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in DL-based models poses challenges for reliability and safety, highlighting the necessity of incorporating UQ. This paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing and learning Interval Neural Networks (INNs) to perform UQ in SysID tasks. INNs are derived by transforming the learnable parameters (LPs) of pre-trained neural networks into interval-valued LPs without relying on probabilistic assumptions. By employing interval arithmetic throughout the network, INNs can generate Prediction Intervals (PIs) that capture target coverage effectively. We extend Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) into Interval LSTM (ILSTM) and Interval NODE (INODE) architectures, providing the mathematical foundations for their application in SysID. To train INNs, we propose a DL framework that integrates a UQ loss function and parameterization tricks to handle constraints arising from interval LPs. We introduce novel concept "elasticity" for underlying uncertainty causes and validate ILSTM and INODE in SysID experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness.

<div> Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent, Optimization, Fractional Calculus, Exponential Tempering, Memory Mechanism<br />
Summary:<br />
Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent (TFGD) is introduced as an optimization framework that combines fractional calculus with exponential tempering to improve gradient-based learning. By incorporating a tempered memory mechanism with fractional coefficients and exponential decay, TFGD addresses issues like oscillatory updates and slow convergence in noisy, high-dimensional landscapes. The algorithm has convergence guarantees in convex settings and stochastic variants, achieving rates of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$ error decay, respectively. With the same time complexity as SGD and memory overhead scaling with the parameter dimension, TFGD outperforms SGD on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, yielding higher test accuracy and faster convergence. The tempered memory mechanism is particularly effective for medical classification tasks, enhancing stable gradient averaging and positioning TFGD as a robust alternative in theoretical and applied machine learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent (TFGD), a novel optimization framework that synergizes fractional calculus with exponential tempering to enhance gradient-based learning. Traditional gradient descent methods often suffer from oscillatory updates and slow convergence in high-dimensional, noisy landscapes. TFGD addresses these limitations by incorporating a tempered memory mechanism, where historical gradients are weighted by fractional coefficients $|w_j| = \binom{\alpha}{j}$ and exponentially decayed via a tempering parameter $\lambda$. Theoretical analysis establishes TFGD's convergence guarantees: in convex settings, it achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate with alignment coefficient $d_{\alpha,\lambda} = (1 - e^{-\lambda})^{-\alpha}$, while stochastic variants attain $\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$ error decay. The algorithm maintains $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time complexity equivalent to SGD, with memory overhead scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d/\lambda)$ for parameter dimension $d$. Empirical validation on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset demonstrates TFGD's superiority, achieving 98.25\% test accuracy (vs. 92.11\% for SGD) and 2$\times$ faster convergence. The tempered memory mechanism proves particularly effective in medical classification tasks, where feature correlations benefit from stable gradient averaging. These results position TFGD as a robust alternative to conventional optimizers in both theoretical and applied machine learning.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel Context-Aware uplift model based on the Two-Stage training approach (TSCAN) to address sample selection bias in Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation. The model comprises CAN-U and CAN-D sub-models to train an uplift model and directly model uplift effects without relying on traditional regularization techniques. CAN-D corrects errors estimated by CAN-U and manages interactions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features using a Context-Aware Attention Layer. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of TSCAN, which is deployed for real-world merchant diagnosis on an online food ordering platform in China, demonstrating its practical utility and impact. <div>

Abstract: A primary challenge in ITE estimation is sample selection bias. Traditional approaches utilize treatment regularization techniques such as the Integral Probability Metrics (IPM), re-weighting, and propensity score modeling to mitigate this bias. However, these regularizations may introduce undesirable information loss and limit the performance of the model. Furthermore, treatment effects vary across different external contexts, and the existing methods are insufficient in fully interacting with and utilizing these contextual features. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware uplift model based on the Two-Stage training approach (TSCAN), comprising CAN-U and CAN-D sub-models. In the first stage, we train an uplift model, called CAN-U, which includes the treatment regularizations of IPM and propensity score prediction, to generate a complete dataset with counterfactual uplift labels. In the second stage, we train a model named CAN-D, which utilizes an isotonic output layer to directly model uplift effects, thereby eliminating the reliance on the regularization components. CAN-D adaptively corrects the errors estimated by CAN-U through reinforcing the factual samples, while avoiding the negative impacts associated with the aforementioned regularizations. Additionally, we introduce a Context-Aware Attention Layer throughout the two-stage process to manage the interactions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features, thereby modeling the varying treatment effect in different contexts. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of TSCAN. Ultimately, the deployment of our model for real-world merchant diagnosis on one of China's largest online food ordering platforms validates its practical utility and impact.

Summary:
Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in understanding brain activity and functional architecture through connectivity patterns. However, decoding task-specific information from neuroimaging data faces challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios and limited sample sizes. This review focuses on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices encode inter-channel relationships. By utilizing Riemannian metrics and treating the space of SPD matrices as a Riemannian manifold, geometric analysis is enabled. The SPD learning framework unifies methodologies that leverage the manifold's geometry to process covariance features, advancing brain imaging analytics. This approach addresses the complexities of neuroimaging data and offers new insights into neural processing mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: Neuroimaging provides a critical framework for characterizing brain activity by quantifying connectivity patterns and functional architecture across modalities. While modern machine learning has significantly advanced our understanding of neural processing mechanisms through these datasets, decoding task-specific signatures must contend with inherent neuroimaging constraints, for example, low signal-to-noise ratios in raw electrophysiological recordings, cross-session non-stationarity, and limited sample sizes. This review focuses on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where often symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices under full-rank conditions encode inter-channel relationships. By equipping the space of SPD matrices with Riemannian metrics (e.g., affine-invariant or log-Euclidean), their space forms a Riemannian manifold enabling geometric analysis. We unify methodologies operating on this manifold under the SPD learning framework, which systematically leverages the SPD manifold's geometry to process covariance features, thereby advancing brain imaging analytics.

Summary:
The article introduces FACTM, a novel Bayesian model that combines factor analysis with correlated topic modeling to analyze multimodal data with structured data modalities such as text or single cell sequencing. The model is optimized using variational inference and includes a method for rotating latent factors to improve interpretability with binary features. Experimental results on text, video, music, and COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in identifying clusters in structured data and integrating them with simple modalities by inferring shared, interpretable factors. By incorporating multiple data modalities and dealing with structured data effectively, FACTM provides valuable insights into underlying phenomena in various domains.

Abstract: Integrating various data modalities brings valuable insights into underlying phenomena. Multimodal factor analysis (FA) uncovers shared axes of variation underlying different simple data modalities, where each sample is represented by a vector of features. However, FA is not suited for structured data modalities, such as text or single cell sequencing data, where multiple data points are measured per each sample and exhibit a clustering structure. To overcome this challenge, we introduce FACTM, a novel, multi-view and multi-structure Bayesian model that combines FA with correlated topic modeling and is optimized using variational inference. Additionally, we introduce a method for rotating latent factors to enhance interpretability with respect to binary features. On text and video benchmarks as well as real-world music and COVID-19 datasets, we demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in identifying clusters in structured data, and integrating them with simple modalities via the inference of shared, interpretable factors.

<div> Compression, Transformers, Entropy, Dynamic Sparsity, FFN module 
Summary:
- Transformers show a unique bias in data compression, preferring lower-entropy distributions over perfectly aligning with the target distribution.
- The FFN module plays a crucial role in driving this bias in Transformers.
- Models exhibit redundancy within their parameters, enabling compression through dynamic sparsity.
- Larger Transformers exhibit a stronger preference for bypassing attention computations and have a lower proportion of active neurons.
- Training instability in larger models is strongly correlated with sudden increases in dead neurons.
<br /><br />Summary: Compression has been a critical aspect in understanding the success of Transformers. An exploration of this reveals that Transformers have a tendency to learn lower-entropy distributions, favoring compression beyond just approaching the target distribution. The FFN module is instrumental in driving this bias. Additionally, models exhibit redundancy within parameters enabling compression through dynamic sparsity. Larger Transformers show a preference for bypassing attention computations and have a lower proportion of active neurons. Training instability in larger models is linked to sudden increases in dead neurons, indicating a need for further exploration of dynamic sparsity patterns in attention and FFN modules. <div>

Abstract: Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of Transformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a criterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often remains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression and to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of the target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is typically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In this work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We find that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression: beyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning lower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the model size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly aligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its information content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical role in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational redundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within their parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through dynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers, particularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for this, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing attention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of active neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger models strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy and dynamic sparsity.

<div> sensitivity, adversarial examples, machine learning, non-learned decision rules, iterative optimizers 

Summary: 
This article explores the sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, specifically iterative optimizers, to adversarial examples. The study, inspired by deep unfolding techniques, reveals that non-learned iterative optimizers exhibit similar vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks as traditional machine learning models. Attacking these optimizers can alter the optimization objective surface and affect the sought minima. The research demonstrates how leveraging the concept of iterative optimizers as machine learning models can enhance robustness through adversarial training. Rigorous proofs and numerical experiments show the vulnerability of various optimizers and the effectiveness of unfolding and adversarial training in increasing robustness. This analysis sheds light on the importance of considering adversarial sensitivity in non-learned decision rules, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating adversarial training strategies to enhance model resilience. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and adversarial training.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel method, called \$PINN, for computing global uncertainty in solving partial differential equations using a Bayesian framework. By combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks with domain decomposition, the method ensures solution continuity across subdomains by imposing flux continuity at the interfaces. Computational experiments on 1D and 2D spatial domains demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of \$PINN in recovering global uncertainty by precisely computing local uncertainty in each subdomain concurrently. The method, based on conservative PINNs, shows robustness by accurately predicting global uncertainty even with up to 15% random noise added to training data and for different domain sizes. This approach offers a promising solution for efficient quantification of uncertainties in big multi-scale problems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.

Abstract: We study the Active Simple Hypothesis Testing (ASHT) problem, a simpler variant of the Fixed Budget Best Arm Identification problem. In this work, we provide novel game theoretic formulation of the upper bounds of the ASHT problem. This formulation allows us to leverage tools of differential games and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to propose an approximately optimal algorithm that is computationally tractable compared to prior work. However, the optimal algorithm still suffers from a curse of dimensionality and instead we use a novel link to Blackwell Approachability to propose an algorithm that is far more efficient computationally. We show that this new algorithm, although not proven to be optimal, is always better than static algorithms in all instances of ASHT and is numerically observed to attain the optimal exponent in various instances.

<div> approximation, rounding function, differentiable optimization, machine learning, sigmoid window functions

Summary:<br />
The article introduces novel smooth approximations to the traditional rounding function, catering to differentiable optimization and machine learning applications. The proposed constructions involve two techniques: localized sigmoid window functions at integers and normalized weighted sums of sigmoid derivatives for local densities. These methods mimic the step-like nature of rounding and enable smooth interpolation between integers while allowing for a controlled balance between smoothness and accuracy. As the sharpness parameter increases, both methods approach the classical rounding function. By focusing on a small set of nearest integers, computational efficiency is maintained without compromising precision. These techniques offer fully differentiable alternatives to hard rounding, especially useful in scenarios requiring gradient-based approaches. <div>

Abstract: We propose novel smooth approximations to the classical rounding function, suitable for differentiable optimization and machine learning applications. Our constructions are based on two approaches: (1) localized sigmoid window functions centered at each integer, and (2) normalized weighted sums of sigmoid derivatives representing local densities. The first method approximates the step-like behavior of rounding through differences of shifted sigmoids, while the second method achieves smooth interpolation between integers via density-based weighting. Both methods converge pointwise to the classical rounding function as the sharpness parameter k tends to infinity, and allow controlled trade-offs between smoothness and approximation accuracy. We demonstrate that by restricting the summation to a small set of nearest integers, the computational cost remains low without sacrificing precision. These constructions provide fully differentiable alternatives to hard rounding, which are valuable in contexts where gradient-based methods are essential.

Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing," i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.

Abstract: Unsustainable exploitation of the oceans exacerbated by global warming is threatening coastal communities worldwide. Accurate and timely monitoring of maritime activity is an essential step to effective governance and to inform future policy. In support of this complex global-scale effort, we built Atlantes, a deep learning based system that provides the first-ever real-time view of vessel behavior at global scale. Atlantes leverages a series of bespoke transformers to distill a high volume, continuous stream of GPS messages emitted by hundreds of thousands of vessels into easily quantifiable behaviors. The combination of low latency and high performance enables operationally relevant decision-making and successful interventions on the high seas where illegal and exploitative activity is too common. Atlantes is already in use by hundreds of organizations worldwide. Here we provide an overview of the model and infrastructure that enables this system to function efficiently and cost-effectively at global-scale and in real-time.

Machine learning-based approaches for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention. This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with desired properties.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated score function to debias kernel density estimation (SD-KDE). In our approach, each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.

Abstract: We introduce Ring-topology Decentralized Federated Learning (RDFL) for distributed model training, aiming to avoid the inherent risks of centralized failure in server-based FL. However, RDFL faces the challenge of low information-sharing efficiency due to the point-to-point communication manner when handling inherent data heterogeneity. Existing studies to mitigate data heterogeneity focus on personalized optimization of models, ignoring that the lack of shared information constraints can lead to large differences among models, weakening the benefits of collaborative learning. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Divide-and-conquer RDFL framework (DRDFL) that uses a feature generation model to extract personalized information and invariant shared knowledge from the underlying data distribution, ensuring both effective personalization and strong generalization. Specifically, we design a \textit{PersonaNet} module that encourages class-specific feature representations to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, facilitating the learning of discriminative latent representations tailored to local data distributions. Meanwhile, the \textit{Learngene} module is introduced to encapsulate shared knowledge through an adversarial classifier to align latent representations and extract globally invariant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRDFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various data heterogeneity settings.

Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

Abstract: The electrification of powertrains is rising as the objective for a more viable future is intensified. To ensure continuous and reliable operation without undesirable malfunctions, it is essential to monitor the internal temperatures of machines and keep them within safe operating limits. Conventional modeling methods can be complex and usually require expert knowledge. With the amount of data collected these days, it is possible to use information models to assess thermal behaviors. This paper investigates artificial intelligence techniques for monitoring the cooling efficiency of induction machines. Experimental data was collected under specific operating conditions, and three machine-learning models have been developed. The optimal configuration for each approach was determined through rigorous hyperparameter searches, and the models were evaluated using a variety of metrics. The three solutions performed well in monitoring the condition of the machine even under transient operation, highlighting the potential of data-driven methods in improving the thermal management.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) excel where phase matters, yet their multi-sheeted decision surfaces defy standard explainability and calibration tools. We propose a \emph{Newton-Puiseux} framework that fits a local polynomial surrogate to a high-uncertainty input and analytically decomposes this surrogate into fractional-power series. The resulting Puiseux expansions, dominant Puiseux coefficients, and phase-aligned curvature descriptors deliver closed-form estimates of robustness and over-confidence that gradient - or perturbation-based methods (saliency, LIME, SHAP) cannot provide. On a controlled $\mathbb{C}^2$ helix the surrogate attains RMSE $< 0.09$ while recovering the number of decision sheets; quartic coefficients predict adversarial flip radii within $10^{-3}$. On the real-world MIT-BIH arrhythmia corpus, Puiseux-guided, phase-aware temperature scaling lowers expected calibration error from 0.087 to 0.034, contributing to the advancement of CVNNs. Full code, pre-trained weights, and scripts are at https://github.com/piotrmgs/puiseux-cvnn.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in formal theorem proving, but their token-level processing often fails to capture the inherent hierarchical nature of mathematical proofs. We introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Attention}, a regularization method that aligns LLMs' attention mechanisms with mathematical reasoning structures. Our approach establishes a five-level hierarchy from foundational elements to high-level concepts, ensuring structured information flow in proof generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves proof success rates by 2.05\% on miniF2F and 1.69\% on ProofNet while reducing proof complexity by 23.81\% and 16.50\% respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Car-pe/HAGBP.

<title>HetGL2R: Learning to Rank Critical Road Segments via Attributed Heterogeneous Graph Random Walks</title>

Abstract: Accurately identifying critical nodes with high spatial influence in road networks is essential for enhancing the efficiency of traffic management and urban planning. However, existing node importance ranking methods mainly rely on structural features and topological information, often overlooking critical factors such as origin-destination (OD) demand and route information. This limitation leaves considerable room for improvement in ranking accuracy. To address this issue, we propose HetGL2R, an attributed heterogeneous graph learning approach for ranking node importance in road networks. This method introduces a tripartite graph (trip graph) to model the structure of the road network, integrating OD demand, route choice, and various structural features of road segments. Based on the trip graph, we design an embedding method to learn node representations that reflect the spatial influence of road segments. The method consists of a heterogeneous random walk sampling algorithm (HetGWalk) and a Transformer encoder. HetGWalk constructs multiple attribute-guided graphs based on the trip graph to enrich the diversity of semantic associations between nodes. It then applies a joint random walk mechanism to convert both topological structures and node attributes into sequences, enabling the encoder to capture spatial dependencies more effectively among road segments. Finally, a listwise ranking strategy is employed to evaluate node importance. To validate the performance of our method, we construct two synthetic datasets using SUMO based on simulated road networks. Experimental results demonstrate that HetGL2R significantly outperforms baselines in incorporating OD demand and route choice information, achieving more accurate and robust node ranking. Furthermore, we conduct a case study using real-world taxi trajectory data from Beijing, further verifying the practicality of the proposed method.

<title>Convergence Properties of Natural Gradient Descent for Minimizing KL Divergence</title>

Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence plays a central role in probabilistic machine learning, where it commonly serves as the canonical loss function. Optimization in such settings is often performed over the probability simplex, where the choice of parameterization significantly impacts convergence. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate systems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family ($\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\eta$ coordinates). We compare Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the coordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient is a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence rates of GD in the $\theta$ and $\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine reparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in $\eta$ and $\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\frac{2}{c}$, respectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of $2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them. Although this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence in continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in discrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to noise, outperforming GD. Our analysis hinges on bounding the spectrum and condition number of the Hessian of the KL divergence at the optimum, which coincides with the Fisher information matrix.

<title>TeleSparse: Practical Privacy-Preserving Verification of Deep Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19274</link>

Abstract: Verification of the integrity of deep learning inference is crucial for understanding whether a model is being applied correctly. However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead.
  We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range.
  TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.

<title>Anyprefer: An Agentic Framework for Preference Data Synthesis</title>

arXiv:2504.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment performance across four main applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and 16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a ubiquitous concept in numerous domains, including the legal system. AI has the potential to revolutionize the functioning of the judiciary and the dispensation of justice. Incorporating AI into the legal system offers the prospect of enhancing decision-making for judges, lawyers, and legal professionals, while concurrently providing the public with more streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective services. The integration of AI into the legal landscape offers manifold benefits, encompassing tasks such as document review, legal research, contract analysis, case prediction, and decision-making. By automating laborious and error-prone procedures, AI has the capacity to alleviate the burden associated with these arduous tasks. Consequently, courts around the world have begun embracing AI technology as a means to enhance the administration of justice. However, alongside its potential advantages, the use of AI in the judiciary poses a range of ethical challenges. These ethical quandaries must be duly addressed to ensure the responsible and equitable deployment of AI systems. This article delineates the principal ethical challenges entailed in employing AI within the judiciary and provides recommendations to effectively address these issues.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative learning paradigm, K-Flow, an algorithm that flows along the $K$-amplitude. Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the $K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective, K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the resolution of image generation.

<title>Rethinking Label-specific Features for Label Distribution Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.

<title>$O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>

arXiv:2504.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.

Abstract: We introduce Hyperparameter Controller (HyperController), a computationally efficient algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during training of reinforcement learning neural networks. HyperController optimizes hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments, HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.

<title>Bi-directional Model Cascading with Proxy Confidence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in deferrals to more costly models.

Abstract: We consider a model of Bayesian observational learning in which a sequence of agents receives a private signal about an underlying binary state of the world. Each agent makes a decision based on its own signal and its observations of previous agents. A central planner seeks to improve the accuracy of these signals by allocating a limited budget to enhance signal quality across agents. We formulate and analyze the budget allocation problem and propose two optimal allocation strategies. At least one of these strategies is shown to maximize the probability of achieving a correct information cascade.

Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67, SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.

arXiv:2504.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph without requiring full knowledge of the entire graph. These substructures are typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying specific local clusters when very few labeled data is given, which we term semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of nodes and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts results in the low-label rates regime.

Abstract: We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning from high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable values are missing. We suppose that the variables are missing not at random (MNAR). The missingness model, denoted by $S(y)$, is the function that maps any point $y$ in $R^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that are seen. In this work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:
  (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the true value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and $\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$ subseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise, $x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., "?"). We design an algorithm that learns $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon, using $poly(d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.
  (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in [d] : v_i^T y <= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in $R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating remarkable capabilities across various applications, present significant challenges during inference due to their substantial model size, especially when deployed on edge devices. Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable performance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43% end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.

Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in control tasks but faces significant challenges in real-world applications, primarily due to the absence of safety guarantees during the learning process. Existing methods often struggle with ensuring safe exploration, leading to potential system failures and restricting applications primarily to simulated environments. Traditional approaches such as reward shaping and constrained policy optimization can fail to guarantee safety during initial learning stages, while model-based methods using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) may hinder efficient exploration and performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Soft Actor-Critic with Control Lyapunov Function (SAC-CLF), a framework that enhances stability and safety through three key innovations: (1) a task-specific CLF design method for safe and optimal performance; (2) dynamic adjustment of constraints to maintain robustness under unmodeled dynamics; and (3) improved control input smoothness while ensuring safety. Experimental results on a classical nonlinear system and satellite attitude control demonstrate the effectiveness of SAC-CLF in overcoming the shortcomings of existing methods.

However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average of 10\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.

<title>DISCO: learning to DISCover an evolution Operator for multi-physics-agnostic prediction</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network, which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator). Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

<title>Identification and Estimation of Long-Term Treatment Effects with Monotone Missing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19527</link>

Abstract: Estimating long-term treatment effects has a wide range of applications in various domains. A key feature in this context is that collecting long-term outcomes typically involves a multi-stage process and is subject to monotone missing, where individuals missing at an earlier stage remain missing at subsequent stages. Despite its prevalence, monotone missing has been rarely explored in previous studies on estimating long-term treatment effects. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the sequential missingness assumption for identification. We propose three novel estimation methods, including inverse probability weighting, sequential regression imputation, and sequential marginal structural model (SeqMSM). Considering that the SeqMSM method may suffer from high variance due to severe data sparsity caused by monotone missing, we further propose a novel balancing-enhanced approach, BalanceNet, to improve the stability and accuracy of the estimation methods. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

<title>Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent (APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.

Abstract: Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery.

<title>Quantifying Memory Utilization with Effective State-Size</title>

arXiv:2504.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory, to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}} (ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with \textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators}, encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention, convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more efficient and effective sequence models.

arXiv:2504.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training. In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons, few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and performance.

<title>Soft-Label Caching and Sharpening for Communication-Efficient Federated Distillation</title>

arXiv:2504.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes, such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets, including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical step towards AI safety in healthcare.

Abstract: Incremental learning that learns new classes over time after the model's deployment is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly for industrial edge systems, where it is difficult to communicate with a remote server to conduct computation-intensive learning. As more classes are expected to learn after their execution for edge devices. In this paper, we propose LODAP, a new on-device incremental learning framework for edge systems. The key part of LODAP is a new module, namely Efficient Incremental Module (EIM). EIM is composed of normal convolutions and lightweight operations. During incremental learning, EIM exploits some lightweight operations, called adapters, to effectively and efficiently learn features for new classes so that it can improve the accuracy of incremental learning while reducing model complexity as well as training overhead. The efficiency of LODAP is further enhanced by a data pruning strategy that significantly reduces the training data, thereby lowering the training overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny- ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that LODAP improves the accuracy by up to 4.32\% over existing methods while reducing around 50\% of model complexity. In addition, evaluations on real edge systems demonstrate its applicability for on-device machine learning. The code is available at https://github.com/duanbiqing/LODAP.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for medical imaging task.

<title>Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.

<title>Hardware/Software Co-Design of RISC-V Extensions for Accelerating Sparse DNNs on FPGAs</title>

arXiv:2504.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The customizability of RISC-V makes it an attractive choice for accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). It can be achieved through instruction set extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and person detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.

arXiv:2504.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown advantages in numerous graph structure tasks but their self-attention mechanism ignores the generalization bias of graphs, with existing methods mainly compensating for this bias from aspects like position encoding, attention bias and relative distance yet still having sub-optimal performance and being insufficient by only considering the structural perspective of generalization bias. To address this, this paper proposes Grafourierformer, which innovatively combines GT with inductive bias containing Frequency-Structure information by applying Graph Fourier Transform to the Attention Matrix: specifically, eigenvalues from the Graph Laplacian matrix are used to construct an Eigenvalue matrix mask (reflecting node positions and structural relationships with neighboring nodes to enable consideration of node range structural characteristics and focus on local graph details), and inverse Fourier transform is employed to extract node high-frequency and low-frequency features, calculate low-frequency and high-frequency energy, and construct a node frequency-energy matrix to filter the eigenvalue matrix mask, allowing attention heads to incorporate both graph structural information and node frequency information optimization, adaptively distinguish global trends from local details, and effectively suppress redundant information interference. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show Grafourierformer consistently outperforms GNN and GT-based models in graph classification and node classification tasks, with ablation experiments further validating the effectiveness and necessity of the method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the natural language processing paradigm but impose substantial demands on memory and computational resources. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory consumption of LLMs. However, advanced single-precision quantization methods experience significant accuracy degradation when quantizing to ultra-low bits. Existing mixed-precision quantization methods are quantized by groups with coarse granularity. Employing high precision for group data leads to substantial memory overhead, whereas low precision severely impacts model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose FineQ, software-hardware co-design for low-bit fine-grained mixed-precision quantization of LLMs. First, FineQ partitions the weights into finer-grained clusters and considers the distribution of outliers within these clusters, thus achieving a balance between model accuracy and memory overhead. Then, we propose an outlier protection mechanism within clusters that uses 3 bits to represent outliers and introduce an encoding scheme for index and data concatenation to enable aligned memory access. Finally, we introduce an accelerator utilizing temporal coding that effectively supports the quantization algorithm while simplifying the multipliers in the systolic array. FineQ achieves higher model accuracy compared to the SOTA mixed-precision quantization algorithm at a close average bit-width. Meanwhile, the accelerator achieves up to 1.79x energy efficiency and reduces the area of the systolic array by 61.2%.

<title>If Concept Bottlenecks are the Question, are Foundation Models the Answer?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs (e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing "VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that, depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

Abstract: Brenier proved that under certain conditions on a source and a target probability measure there exists a strictly convex function such that its gradient is a transport map from the source to the target distribution. This function is called the Brenier potential. Furthermore, detailed information on the H\"older regularity of the Brenier potential is available. In this work we develop the statistical learning theory of generative adversarial neural networks that learn the Brenier potential. As by the transformation of densities formula, the density of the generated measure depends on the second derivative of the Brenier potential, we develop the universal approximation theory of ReCU networks with cubic activation $\mathtt{ReCU}(x)=\max\{0,x\}^3$ that combines the favorable approximation properties of H\"older functions with a Lipschitz continuous density. In order to assure the convexity of such general networks, we introduce an adversarial training procedure for a potential function represented by the ReCU networks that combines the classical discriminator cross entropy loss with a penalty term that enforces (strict) convexity. We give a detailed decomposition of learning errors and show that for a suitable high penalty parameter all networks chosen in the adversarial min-max optimization problem are strictly convex. This is further exploited to prove the consistency of the learning procedure for (slowly) expanding network capacity. We also implement the described learning algorithm and apply it to a number of standard test cases from Gaussian mixture to image data as target distributions. As predicted in theory, we observe that the convexity loss becomes inactive during the training process and the potentials represented by the neural networks have learned convexity.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due to their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.

<title>Contextures: The Mechanism of Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress.
  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts.
  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.

Abstract: Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on both node- and graph-level tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Finally, by incorporating recent advances in graph contrastive learning, HU-GNN maintains diverse, structurally faithful embeddings. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

<title>TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

arXiv:2504.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the universal approximation capability of single-layer, single-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms with minimal attached structures. Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input domain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This allows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates the target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention layer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating any continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\infty$-norm. Furthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable function under $L_p$-norm for $1\leq p <\infty$. Lastly, we also extend our techniques and show that, for the first time, single-head cross-attention achieves the same universal approximation guarantees.

<title>Convergence Analysis of Asynchronous Federated Learning with Gradient Compression for Non-Convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: Gradient compression is an effective technique for reducing communication costs in federated learning (FL), and error feedback (EF) is usually adopted to remedy the compression errors. However, there remains a lack of systematic study on these techniques in asynchronous FL. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different frameworks. We firstly consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and provide an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a superior convergence rate than prior studies. Then, we consider a variant framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC. We show sufficient conditions for its convergence to the optimum, indicating the interaction between asynchronous delay and compression rate. Our analysis also demonstrates that asynchronous delay amplifies the variance caused by compression, thereby hindering convergence, and such an impact is exacerbated by high data heterogeneity. Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation despite asynchronous delay, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term. Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well.

Abstract: Federated learning with heterogeneous data and personalization has received significant recent attention. Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the context of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore combining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a constant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm whose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted samples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a constant factor.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances model performance by utilizing knowledge from related domains, particularly when labeled data is scarce. While existing research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains. Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.

arXiv:2504.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot \sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent $k_*>2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion), $\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p} a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where $\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network. Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative objective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Abstract: There are many different nature-inspired algorithms in the literature, and almost all such algorithms have algorithm-dependent parameters that need to be tuned. The proper setting and parameter tuning should be carried out to maximize the performance of the algorithm under consideration. This work is the extension of the recent work on parameter tuning by Joy et al. (2024) presented at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2024), and the Firefly Algorithm (FA) is tuned using three different methods: the Monte Carlo method, the Quasi-Monte Carlo method and the Latin Hypercube Sampling. The FA with the tuned parameters is then used to solve a set of six different optimization problems, and the possible effect of parameter setting on the quality of the optimal solutions is analyzed. Rigorous statistical hypothesis tests have been carried out, including Student's t-tests, F-tests, non-parametric Friedman tests and ANOVA. Results show that the performance of the FA is not influenced by the tuning methods used. In addition, the tuned parameter values are largely independent of the tuning methods used. This indicates that the FA can be flexible and equally effective in solving optimization problems, and any of the three tuning methods can be used to tune its parameters effectively.

Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent and evolving threat to modern networked systems, capable of causing large-scale service disruptions. The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within high-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and intelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional methods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each offer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack environments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a detailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to large-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method that leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative features. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively ranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental evaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only improves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational efficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality. These results point to the potential of integrating generative learning models into cybersecurity pipelines to build more adaptive and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: The de-identification of private information in medical data is a crucial process to mitigate the risk of confidentiality breaches, particularly when patient personal details are not adequately removed before the release of medical records. Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing patient privacy protection.

Abstract: This paper presents two attack strategies designed to evade detection in ADMM-based systems by preventing significant changes to the residual during the attacked iteration. While many detection algorithms focus on identifying false data injection through residual changes, we show that our attacks remain undetected by keeping the residual largely unchanged. The first strategy uses a random starting point combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure stealth, with potential for refinement by enhancing the orthogonal component to increase system disruption. The second strategy builds on the first, targeting financial gains by manipulating reactive power and pushing the system to its upper voltage limit, exploiting operational constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed attack-resilient mechanism is demonstrated through case studies on the IEEE 14-bus system. A comparison of the two strategies, along with commonly used naive attacks, reveals trade-offs between simplicity, detectability, and effectiveness, providing insights into ADMM system vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the need for more robust monitoring algorithms to protect against advanced attack strategies.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in smart home environments, has introduced considerable security and privacy concerns due to their persistent connectivity and interaction with cloud services. Despite advancements in IoT security, effective privacy measures remain uncovered, with existing solutions often relying on cloud-based threat detection that exposes sensitive data or outdated allow-lists that inadequately restrict non-essential network traffic. This work presents ML-IoTrim, a system for detecting and mitigating non-essential IoT traffic (i.e., not influencing the device operations) by analyzing network behavior at the edge, leveraging Machine Learning to classify network destinations. Our approach includes building a labeled dataset based on IoT device behavior and employing a feature-extraction pipeline to enable a binary classification of essential vs. non-essential network destinations. We test our framework in a consumer smart home setup with IoT devices from five categories, demonstrating that the model can accurately identify and block non-essential traffic, including previously unseen destinations, without relying on traditional allow-lists. We implement our solution on a home access point, showing the framework has strong potential for scalable deployment, supporting near-real-time traffic classification in large-scale IoT environments with hundreds of devices. This research advances privacy-aware traffic control in smart homes, paving the way for future developments in IoT device privacy.

Abstract: This paper explores the strategic use of modern synthetic data generation and advanced data perturbation techniques to enhance security, maintain analytical utility, and improve operational efficiency when managing large datasets, with a particular focus on the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector. We contrast these advanced methods encompassing generative models like GANs, sophisticated context-aware PII transformation, configurable statistical perturbation, and differential privacy with traditional anonymization approaches.
  The goal is to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets that retain high utility for complex machine learning tasks and analytics, a critical need in the data-sensitive industries like BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, and Telecommunications. We discuss how these modern techniques potentially offer significant improvements in balancing privacy preservation while maintaining data utility compared to older methods. Furthermore, we examine the potential for operational gains, such as reduced overhead and accelerated analytics, by using these privacy-enhanced datasets. We also explore key use cases where these methods can mitigate regulatory risks and enable scalable, data-driven innovation without compromising sensitive customer information.

Abstract: Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22% of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance, and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) applications often benefit from structured sparsity, a technique that efficiently reduces model complexity and simplifies handling of sparse data in hardware. Sparse systolic tensor arrays - specifically designed to accelerate these structured-sparse ML models - play a pivotal role in enabling efficient computations. As ML is increasingly integrated into safety-critical systems, it is of paramount importance to ensure the reliability of these systems. This paper introduces an online error-checking technique capable of detecting and locating permanent faults within sparse systolic tensor arrays before computation begins. The new technique relies on merely four test vectors and exploits the weight values already loaded within the systolic array to comprehensively test the system. Fault-injection campaigns within the gate-level netlist, while executing three well-established Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, which is shown to achieve very high fault coverage, while incurring minimal performance and area overheads.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics. A popular approach to unsupervised AD is clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD (Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.

Abstract: We evaluate the current state of collective communication on GPU-based supercomputers for large language model (LLM) training at scale. Existing libraries such as RCCL and Cray-MPICH exhibit critical limitations on systems such as Frontier -- Cray-MPICH underutilizes network and compute resources, while RCCL suffers from severe scalability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce PCCL, a communication library with highly optimized implementations of all-gather and reduce-scatter operations tailored for distributed deep learning workloads. PCCL is designed to maximally utilize all available network and compute resources and to scale efficiently to thousands of GPUs. It achieves substantial performance improvements, delivering 6-33x speedups over RCCL and 28-70x over Cray-MPICH for all-gather on 2048 GCDs of Frontier. These gains translate directly to end-to-end performance: in large-scale GPT-3-style training, PCCL provides up to 60% and 40% speedups over RCCL for 7B and 13B parameter models, respectively.

Abstract: Video summarization creates an abridged version (i.e., a summary) that provides a quick overview of the video while retaining pertinent information. In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS, Mr.HiSum, and the WikiHow test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization on the target datasets.

Abstract: The local least squares estimator for a regression curve cannot provide optimal results when non-Gaussian noise is present. Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that residuals often exhibit distributional properties different from those of a normal distribution, making it worthwhile to consider estimation based on other norms. It is suggested that $L_p$-norm estimators be used to minimize the residuals when these exhibit non-normal kurtosis. In this paper, we propose a local polynomial $L_p$-norm regression that replaces weighted least squares estimation with weighted $L_p$-norm estimation for fitting the polynomial locally. We also introduce a new method for estimating the parameter $p$ from the residuals, enhancing the adaptability of the approach. Through numerical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate our method's superiority over local least squares in one-dimensional data and show promising outcomes for higher dimensions, specifically in 2D.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law. General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning, progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks (BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.

Abstract: Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data. Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%) and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable, resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual effort and computational cost.

Abstract: Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework, grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation. Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators' quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated videos will be publicly available.

Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.

Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.

Abstract: Ensuring safety and robustness of robot skills is becoming crucial as robots are required to perform increasingly complex and dynamic tasks. The former is essential when performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic robot skills learned from demonstrations. Specifically, we build on neural contractive dynamical systems to provide robust extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a full-body obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability via diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in complex environments where implicit scene representations, such as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are necessary. To this end, our framework called Signed Distance Field Diffeomorphic Transform, leverages SDFs and flow-based diffeomorphisms to achieve contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world robotic tasks in a kitchen environment. Our results show that our approach locally adapts the learned contractive vector field while staying close to the learned dynamics and without introducing highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Nash equilibrium is perhaps the best-known solution concept in game theory. Such a solution assigns a strategy to each player which offers no incentive to unilaterally deviate. While a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to always exist, the problem of finding one in general-sum games is PPAD-complete, generally considered intractable. Regret minimization is an efficient framework for approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. However, in general-sum games, such algorithms are only guaranteed to converge to a coarse-correlated equilibrium (CCE), a solution concept where players can correlate their strategies. In this work, we use meta-learning to minimize the correlations in strategies produced by a regret minimizer. This encourages the regret minimizer to find strategies that are closer to a Nash equilibrium. The meta-learned regret minimizer is still guaranteed to converge to a CCE, but we give a bound on the distance to Nash equilibrium in terms of our meta-loss. We evaluate our approach in general-sum imperfect information games. Our algorithms provide significantly better approximations of Nash equilibria than state-of-the-art regret minimization techniques.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models' refusal behavior is primarily encoded in a single direction in their latent space, making it vulnerable to targeted attacks. Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to improve robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question remains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying representation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for evaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear refusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety fine-tuning (SSFT).
  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the refusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding space adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between harmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal representation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain approximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly higher than in reference models. This concentrated representation leads to more effective and transferable refusal vectors for ablation attacks: LAT models show improved robustness when attacked with vectors from reference models but become more vulnerable to self-generated vectors compared to SSFT and AT. Our findings suggest that LAT's training perturbations enable a more comprehensive representation of refusal behavior, highlighting both its potential strengths and vulnerabilities for improving model safety.

Abstract: We propose a parametric integral probability metric (IPM) to measure the discrepancy between two probability measures. The proposed IPM leverages a specific parametric family of discriminators, such as single-node neural networks with ReLU activation, to effectively distinguish between distributions, making it applicable in high-dimensional settings. By optimizing over the parameters of the chosen discriminator class, the proposed IPM demonstrates that its estimators have good convergence rates and can serve as a surrogate for other IPMs that use smooth nonparametric discriminator classes. We present an efficient algorithm for practical computation, offering a simple implementation and requiring fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we explore its applications in various tasks, such as covariate balancing for causal inference and fair representation learning. Across such diverse applications, we demonstrate that the proposed IPM provides strong theoretical guarantees, and empirical experiments show that it achieves comparable or even superior performance to other methods.

Abstract: In the forthcoming era of 6G networks, characterized by unprecedented data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive connectivity, effective management of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is essential. VNFs are software-based counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and scalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and convergence using $\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of next-generation networks.

Abstract: We present a framework for adaptive-stepsize MCMC sampling based on time-rescaled Langevin dynamics, in which the stepsize variation is dynamically driven by an additional degree of freedom. Our approach augments the phase space by an additional variable which in turn defines a time reparameterization. The use of an auxiliary relaxation equation allows accumulation of a moving average of a local monitor function and provides for precise control of the timestep while circumventing the need to modify the drift term in the physical system. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement and can be readily combined with any off-the-peg fixed-stepsize Langevin integrator. As a particular example, we consider control of the stepsize by monitoring the norm of the log-posterior gradient, which takes inspiration from the Adam optimizer, the stepsize being automatically reduced in regions of steep change of the log posterior and increased on plateaus, improving numerical stability and convergence speed. As in Adam, the stepsize variation depends on the recent history of the gradient norm, which enhances stability and improves accuracy compared to more immediate control approaches. We demonstrate the potential benefit of this method--both in accuracy and in stability--in numerical experiments including Neal's funnel and a Bayesian neural network for classification of MNIST data.

Abstract: Regret minimization is a general approach to online optimization which plays a crucial role in many algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. The literature mainly focuses on solving individual games in isolation. However, in practice, players often encounter a distribution of similar but distinct games. For example, when trading correlated assets on the stock market, or when refining the strategy in subgames of a much larger game. Recently, offline meta-learning was used to accelerate one-sided equilibrium finding on such distributions. We build upon this, extending the framework to the more challenging self-play setting, which is the basis for most state-of-the-art equilibrium approximation algorithms for domains at scale. When selecting the strategy, our method uniquely integrates information across all decision states, promoting global communication as opposed to the traditional local regret decomposition. Empirical evaluation on normal-form games and river poker subgames shows our meta-learned algorithms considerably outperform other state-of-the-art regret minimization algorithms.

Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Building on these findings, we propose a set of design suggestions, rooted in empirical observations, that align AI assistance with human goals of clarity, completeness, creativity, and efficiency, through hybrid planning, adaptive execution, and decision-point support. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems. All data and code are available on our project page (https://minnesotanlp.github.io/LawFlow-website/).

Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive (spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges, possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems, establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.

<title>Modeling Regime Structure and Informational Drivers of Stock Market Volatility via the Financial Chaos Index</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the structural dynamics of stock market volatility through the Financial Chaos Index, a tensor- and eigenvalue-based measure designed to capture realized volatility via mutual fluctuations among asset prices. Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior and perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a regime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law distribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023 identifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and high-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress, statistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the segmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that shape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors derived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net regression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index. Our findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and geopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility dynamics across regimes. Together, these results offer a unified empirical perspective on how systemic uncertainty governs both the realized evolution of financial markets and the anticipatory behavior embedded in implied volatility measures.

Abstract: While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing: users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/galmog/REED-VAE

<title>Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents</title>

Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Rapid developments in advanced sensing and imaging have significantly enhanced information visibility, opening opportunities for predictive modeling of complex dynamic systems. However, sensing signals acquired from such complex systems are often distributed across 3D geometries and rapidly evolving over time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.

Abstract: Semantic reasoning aims to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge, with OWL ontologies serving as a standardized framework for organizing information. A key challenge in semantic reasoning is verifying ontology consistency. However, state-of-the-art reasoners are computationally expensive, and their efficiency decreases as ontology sizes grow. While classical machine learning models have been explored for consistency checking, they struggle to capture complex relationships within ontologies. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for simple reasoning tasks but perform poorly on structured reasoning. The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers a way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper proposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that transforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM architecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model input. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving $95\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work will explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) into experimental nuclear and particle physics has driven significant progress in simulation and reconstruction workflows. However, traditional simulation frameworks such as Geant4 remain computationally intensive, especially for Cherenkov detectors, where simulating optical photon transport through complex geometries and reflective surfaces introduces a major bottleneck. To address this, we present an open, standalone fast simulation tool for Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov Light (DIRC) detectors, with a focus on the High-Performance DIRC (hpDIRC) at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our framework incorporates a suite of generative models tailored to accelerate particle identification (PID) tasks by offering a scalable, GPU-accelerated alternative to full Geant4-based simulations. Designed with accessibility in mind, our simulation package enables both DL researchers and physicists to efficiently generate high-fidelity large-scale datasets on demand, without relying on complex traditional simulation stacks. This flexibility supports the development and benchmarking of novel DL-driven PID methods. Moreover, this fast simulation pipeline represents a critical step toward enabling EIC-wide PID strategies that depend on virtually unlimited simulated samples, spanning the full acceptance of the hpDIRC.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have shown potential in various applications. However, accurately reconstructing the image or providing clear details via image super-resolution remains challenging. This paper introduces Quantum Fourier Gaussian Network (QFGN), a quantum-based machine learning model for better signal representations. The frequency spectrum is well balanced by penalizing the low-frequency components, leading to the improved expressivity of quantum circuits. The results demonstrate that with minimal parameters, QFGN outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Despite noise on hardware, the model achieves accuracy comparable to that of SIREN, highlighting the potential applications of quantum machine learning in this field.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components, involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and breadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent view of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with the knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map future research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven character-animation technologies. This survey is intended as a resource for researchers and developers entering the field of generative AI animation or adjacent fields.

Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models, enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework, ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks: categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses, surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, but their 3D convolutional structures introduce high computational costs and limited generalization in few-shot scenarios. Domain shifts caused by sensor differences and environmental variations further hinder cross-dataset adaptability. Metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) prototype networks mitigate this problem, yet their performance is sensitive to prototype quality, especially with limited samples. To overcome these challenges, a dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features, alleviating domain shift. Experiments on four publicly available HSI datasets illustrate that the proposal achieves superior performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: Circuit compilation, a crucial process for adapting quantum algorithms to hardware constraints, often operates as a ``black box,'' with limited visibility into the optimization techniques used by proprietary systems or advanced open-source frameworks. Due to fundamental differences in qubit technologies, efficient compiler design is an expensive process, further exposing these systems to various security threats. In this work, we take a first step toward evaluating one such challenge affecting compiler confidentiality, specifically, reverse-engineering compilation methodologies. We propose a simple ML-based framework to infer underlying optimization techniques by leveraging structural differences observed between original and compiled circuits. The motivation is twofold: (1) enhancing transparency in circuit optimization for improved cross-platform debugging and performance tuning, and (2) identifying potential intellectual property (IP)-protected optimizations employed by commercial systems. Our extensive evaluation across thousands of quantum circuits shows that a neural network performs the best in detecting optimization passes, with individual pass F1-scores reaching as high as 0.96. Thus, our initial study demonstrates the viability of this threat to compiler confidentiality and underscores the need for active research in this area.

Abstract: Climate change affects ocean temperature, salinity and sea level, impacting monsoons and ocean productivity. Future projections by Global Climate Models based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change. However, CMIP models have significant bias compared to reanalysis in the Bay of Bengal for the time period when both projections and reanalysis are available. For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6 projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the three deep neural models has been completed. We found that the UNet architecture trained using a climatology-removed CNRM-CM6 projection as input and climatology-removed ORAS5 as output gives the best bias-corrected projections. Our novel deep learning-based method for correcting CNRM-CM6 data has a 15% reduction in RMSE compared EDCDF.

Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming state-of-the-art process reward models.

Abstract: We measure the effects of several implementation choices for the Dynamic Embedded Topic Model, as applied to five distinct diachronic corpora, with the goal of isolating important decisions for its use and further development. We identify priorities that will maximize utility in applied scholarship, including the practical scalability of vocabulary size to best exploit the strengths of embedded representations, and more flexible modeling of intervals to accommodate the uneven temporal distributions of historical writing. Of similar importance, we find performance is not significantly or consistently affected by several aspects that otherwise limit the model's application or might consume the resources of a grid search.

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

<title>Test Set Sizing for the Ridge Regression</title>

Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish except for m and the number of features, n. This is the first time that such a split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first two terms asymptotically, and it appears that practically there is no difference.

<title>The effect of the number of parameters and the number of local feature patches on loss landscapes in distributed quantum neural networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum neural networks hold promise for tackling computationally challenging tasks that are intractable for classical computers. However, their practical application is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from complex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local minima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits increases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization challenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical data, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across multiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent quantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this study, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss landscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via Hessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that increasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss landscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches significantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding suggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit regularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing generalization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization challenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising strategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning models for classical data tasks.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of human rights considerations into AI regulatory frameworks across different IEEE regions - specifically the United States (Region 1-6), Europe (Region 8), China (part of Region 10), and Singapore (part of Region 10). While all acknowledge the transformative potential of AI and the necessity of ethical guidelines, their regulatory approaches significantly differ. Europe exhibits a rigorous framework with stringent protections for individual rights, while the U.S. promotes innovation with less restrictive regulations. China emphasizes state control and societal order in its AI strategies. In contrast, Singapore's advisory framework encourages self-regulation and aligns closely with international norms. This comparative analysis underlines the need for ongoing global dialogue to harmonize AI regulations that safeguard human rights while promoting technological advancement, reflecting the diverse perspectives and priorities of each region.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Abstract: Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements, executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads. In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems. NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves 31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.

Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art (SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy guardrail models. %
On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created, our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92} points over Aegis-LlamaGuard and \textbf{21.62} over \texttt{gpt-4o}, respectively. Lastly, our guardrail synthetic data generation process that uses custom task-specific guardrail poli

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a pivotal paradigm in artificial intelligence to align large models with human preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to simultaneously conduct the online decision-making and statistical inference on the optimal model using human preference data based on dynamic contextual information. Our approach introduces an efficient decision strategy that achieves both the optimal regret bound and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators. A key challenge in RLHF is handling the dependent online human preference outcomes with dynamic contexts. To address this, in the methodological aspect, we propose a two-stage algorithm starting with $\epsilon$-greedy followed by exploitations; in the theoretical aspect, we tailor anti-concentration inequalities and matrix martingale concentration techniques to derive the uniform estimation rate and asymptotic normality of the estimators using dependent samples from both stages. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art strategies. We apply the proposed framework to analyze the human preference data for ranking large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset, yielding insightful results on the performance of different large language models for medical anatomy knowledge.

Abstract: Recent studies observed a surprising concept on model test error called the double descent phenomenon, where the increasing model complexity decreases the test error first and then the error increases and decreases again. To observe this, we work on a two layer neural network model with a ReLU activation function designed for binary classification under supervised learning. Our aim is to observe and investigate the mathematical theory behind the double descent behavior of model test error for varying model sizes. We quantify the model size by the ratio of number of training samples to the dimension of the model. Due to the complexity of the empirical risk minimization procedure, we use the Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem to find a suitable candidate for the global training loss.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+ significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: We present a machine learning analysis of circular dichroism spectra of globular proteins from the SP175 database, using the optimal transport-based $1$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_1$ (with order $p=1$) and the manifold learning algorithm $t$-SNE. Our results demonstrate that $\mathcal{W}_1$ is consistent with both Euclidean and Manhattan metrics while exhibiting robustness to noise. On the other hand, $t$-SNE uncovers meaningful structure in the high-dimensional data. The clustering in the $t$-SNE embedding is primarily determined by proteins with distinct secondary structure compositions: one cluster predominantly contains $\beta$-rich proteins, while the other consists mainly of proteins with mixed $\alpha/\beta$ and $\alpha$-helical content.

Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender, ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training. In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.

Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the dynamic optimization of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset. The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical value in building high-quality language generation systems.

Abstract: When implementing prediction models for high-stakes real-world applications such as medicine, finance, and autonomous systems, quantifying prediction uncertainty is critical for effective risk management. Traditional approaches to uncertainty quantification, such as confidence and prediction intervals, provide probability coverage guarantees for the expected outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the realized outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\epsilon$. Instead, this paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic framework for quantifying uncertainty in continuous and binary outcomes using confidence sets for outcome excursions, where the goal is to identify a subset of the feature space where the expected or realized outcome exceeds a specific value. The proposed method constructs data-dependent inner and outer confidence sets that aim to contain the true feature subset for which the expected or realized outcomes of these features exceed a specified threshold. We establish theoretical guarantees for the probability that these confidence sets contain the true feature subset, both asymptotically and for finite sample sizes. The framework is validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its utility in contexts such as housing price prediction and time to sepsis diagnosis in healthcare. This approach provides a unified method for uncertainty quantification that is broadly applicable across various continuous and binary prediction models.

Abstract: Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

Abstract: We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike' feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).

Abstract: Straight line equation $y=mx$ with slope $m$, when singularly perturbed as $ay^3+y=mx$ with a positive parameter $a$, results in S-shaped curves or S-curves on a real plane. As $a\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a cumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that describes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable. As $a\rightarrow\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$ resembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work, we propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform distribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves are superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally linear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of natural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of enzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form as a statistical model. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing flower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern recognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can be represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our parametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to initial conditions depending on the data at hand.

Abstract: We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for mechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary differential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural networks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a Hamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This NINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI plant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force actuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required for stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural networks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and stability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a nonlinear mass-spring system.

<title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks</title>

Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.

<title>FlashOverlap: A Lightweight Design for Efficiently Overlapping Communication and Computation</title>

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various applications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU communication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly on consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution, overlapping computation and communication latency is an effective technique for mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an efficient and adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to maintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously optimize for all of those features.
  To address the issue, we propose FlashOverlap, a lightweight design characterized by tile-wise overlapping, interference-free computation, and communication agnosticism. FlashOverlap utilizes a novel signaling mechanism to identify tile-wise data dependency without interrupting the computation process, and reorders data to contiguous addresses, enabling communication by simply calling NCCL APIs. Experiments show that such a lightweight design achieves up to 1.65x speedup, outperforming existing works in most cases.

<title>Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities</title>

Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

Abstract: Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits their practical adoption. To address this challenge, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, due to their reliance on external systems to learn from, require digital environments (e.g., simulators) with very simple interfaces, which in turn constrain significantly the implementation of such environments. In particular, these environments are implemented either as separate processes or as state machines, leading to synchronization and communication overheads in the first case, and to unstructured programming in the second.
  We propose a new domain-specific, co-routine-based, compiled language, called Rulebook, designed to automatically generate the state machine required to interact with machine learning (ML) algorithms and similar applications, with no performance overhead. Rulebook allows users to express programs without needing to be aware of the specific interface required by the ML components. By decoupling the execution model of the program from the syntactical encoding of the program, and thus without the need for manual state management, Rulebook allows to create larger and more sophisticated environments at a lower development cost.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities. However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort. This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM, an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.

Abstract: Social financial technology focuses on trust, sustainability, and social responsibility, which require advanced technologies to address complex financial tasks in the digital era. With the rapid growth in online transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML) models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of subtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in noisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets. To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network (QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of 82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead. Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its robustness across various error conditions. Our findings highlight QFDNN potential to enhance trust and security in social financial technology by accurately detecting fraudulent transactions while supporting sustainability through its resource-efficient design and minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams, each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team. We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.

<title>GAN-SLAM: Real-Time GAN Aided Floor Plan Creation Through SLAM</title>

Abstract: SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment. SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel 'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a 2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps. The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems. Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field, improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.

Abstract: SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes. To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning, with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and nonlinear processing.

Abstract: Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly, resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks, and collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations, multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments. Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025 that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research, academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems, multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally, we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to convolutional approaches for vision tasks such as image classification, leveraging patch-based representations instead of raw pixels. These methods construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human perception, especially in deeper layers.

Abstract: Accurate weather classification from low-quality traffic camera imagery remains a challenging task, particularly under adverse nighttime conditions. In this study, we propose a scalable framework that combines generative domain adaptation with efficient contrastive learning to enhance classification performance. Using CycleGAN-based domain translation, we improve the quality of nighttime images, enabling better feature extraction by downstream models. While the baseline EVA-02 model employing CLIP-based contrastive loss achieves an overall accuracy of 96.55\%, it exhibits a significant performance gap between daytime (97.21\%) and nighttime conditions (63.40\%). Replacing CLIP with the lightweight SigLIP-2 (Sigmoid contrastive loss) achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 94.00\%, with substantial improvements in nighttime performance (85.90\% accuracy). The combination of Vision-SigLIP-2, Text-SigLIP-2, CycleGAN, and contrastive training achieves the best nighttime accuracy (85.90\%) among all models tested, while EVA-02 with CycleGAN maintains the highest overall accuracy (97.01\%) and per-class accuracies. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining domain adaptation and efficient contrastive learning to build practical, resource-efficient weather classification systems for intelligent transportation infrastructure.

Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric variations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.

However, the substantial memory overhead caused by their vast number of parameters, combined with the high computational demands of the attention mechanism, poses significant challenges in achieving low latency and high throughput for LLM inference services. Recent advancements, driven by groundbreaking research, have significantly accelerated progress in this field. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of these methods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level strategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important areas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling, decoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation paradigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment, multi-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging scenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and auxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several niche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to further advance the field of LLM inference serving.

Abstract: Traffic light perception is an essential component of the camera-based perception system for autonomous vehicles, enabling accurate detection and interpretation of traffic lights to ensure safe navigation through complex urban environments. In this work, we propose a modularized perception framework that integrates state-of-the-art detection models with a novel real-time association and decision framework, enabling seamless deployment into an autonomous driving stack. To address the limitations of existing public datasets, we introduce the ATLAS dataset, which provides comprehensive annotations of traffic light states and pictograms across diverse environmental conditions and camera setups. This dataset is publicly available at https://url.fzi.de/ATLAS. We train and evaluate several state-of-the-art traffic light detection architectures on ATLAS, demonstrating significant performance improvements in both accuracy and robustness. Finally, we evaluate the framework in real-world scenarios by deploying it in an autonomous vehicle to make decisions at traffic light-controlled intersections, highlighting its reliability and effectiveness for real-time operation.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys, particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1. Our fundings demonstrate the potential of ML framework for accelerated search of high-performance, Co- and Ni-free, soft magnetic materials.

Abstract: The increased demand for data privacy and security in machine learning (ML) applications has put impetus on effective edge training on Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes. Edge training aims to leverage speed, energy efficiency and adaptability within the resource constraints of the nodes. Deploying and training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based models at the edge, although accurate, posit significant challenges from the back-propagation algorithm's complexity, bit precision trade-offs, and heterogeneity of DNN layers. This paper presents a Dynamic Tsetlin Machine (DTM) training accelerator as an alternative to DNN implementations. DTM utilizes logic-based on-chip inference with finite-state automata-driven learning within the same Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) package. Underpinned on the Vanilla and Coalesced Tsetlin Machine algorithms, the dynamic aspect of the accelerator design allows for a run-time reconfiguration targeting different datasets, model architectures, and model sizes without resynthesis. This makes the DTM suitable for targeting multivariate sensor-based edge tasks. Compared to DNNs, DTM trains with fewer multiply-accumulates, devoid of derivative computation. It is a data-centric ML algorithm that learns by aligning Tsetlin automata with input data to form logical propositions enabling efficient Look-up-Table (LUT) mapping and frugal Block RAM usage in FPGA training implementations. The proposed accelerator offers 2.54x more Giga operations per second per Watt (GOP/s per W) and uses 6x less power than the next-best comparable design.

Abstract: An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with software enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables an AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination. Digital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running what-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault diagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using continuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly possible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced analyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine learning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based approach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV before reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate anomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and assist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two machine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the predicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across waypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor and actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores reaching 99\% across multiple vessels.

Abstract: Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.

<title>semi-PD: Towards Efficient LLM Serving via Phase-Wise Disaggregated Computation and Unified Storage</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19867</link>

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories: 1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs. The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3) storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and 4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high request rates.
  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM) level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency constraints on Llama series models.

<title>Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Training with Adaptive Expert Replication</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a widely adopted solution to continue scaling model sizes without a corresponding linear increase in compute. During MoE model training, each input token is dynamically routed to a subset of experts -- sparsely-activated feed-forward networks -- within each transformer layer. The distribution of tokens assigned to each expert varies widely and rapidly over the course of training. To handle the wide load imbalance across experts, current systems are forced to either drop tokens assigned to popular experts, degrading convergence, or frequently rebalance resources allocated to each expert based on popularity, incurring high state migration overheads.
  To break this performance-accuracy tradeoff, we introduce SwiftMoE, an adaptive MoE training system. The key insight of SwiftMoE is to decouple the placement of expert parameters from their large optimizer state. SwiftMoE statically partitions the optimizer of each expert across all training nodes. Meanwhile, SwiftMoE dynamically adjusts the placement of expert parameters by repurposing existing weight updates, avoiding migration overheads. In doing so, SwiftMoE right-sizes the GPU resources allocated to each expert, on a per-iteration basis, with minimal overheads. Compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, DeepSpeed and FlexMoE, SwiftMoE is able to achieve a 30.5% and 25.9% faster time-to-convergence, respectively.

Abstract: The Dynamic Task Assignment Problem (DTAP) concerns matching resources to tasks in real time while minimizing some objectives, like resource costs or task cycle time. In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case, involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS. To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on different time horizons and across instances.

<title>On Stopping Times of Power-one Sequential Tests: Tight Lower and Upper Bounds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals $\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where $\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases. Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form; our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.

<title>Enhancing short-term traffic prediction by integrating trends and fluctuations with attention mechanism</title>

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the interaction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep learning models often struggle with these challenges because their architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model. Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness and precision of traffic prediction models.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for generating lasers via second harmonic generation (SHG) are highly sought in today's technology. However, discovering novel materials with considerable SHG is challenging due to the time-consuming and costly nature of both experimental methods and first-principles calculations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach using the Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) to predict NLO properties. Sourcing data from the Novel Opto-Electronic Materials Discovery (NOEMD) database and using the Kurtz-Perry (KP) coefficient as the key target, we developed a robust model capable of accurately estimating nonlinear optical responses. Our results demonstrate that the model achieves 82.5% accuracy at a tolerated absolute error up to 1 pm/V and relative error not exceeding 0.5. This work highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating the discovery and design of advanced optical materials with desired properties.

Abstract: Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity, as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water. Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity, and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However, monitoring weed management methods is challenging as commonly rely on on-ground field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In order to tackle this problem, we leverage Earth Observation (EO) data and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed an ML approach for mapping four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and No practice) in orchards using satellite image time series (SITS) data from two different sources: Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS). The findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.

Abstract: The widespread use of Exogenous Organic Matter in agriculture necessitates monitoring to assess its effects on soil and crop health. This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the potential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective monitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and sustainability.

<title>Knowledge Distillation of Domain-adapted LLMs for Question-Answering in Telecom</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the approaches to reduce the size of Large Language Models (LLMs). A LLM with smaller number of model parameters (student) is trained to mimic the performance of a LLM of a larger size (teacher model) on a specific task. For domain-specific tasks, it is not clear if teacher or student model, or both, must be considered for domain adaptation. In this work, we study this problem from perspective of telecom domain Question-Answering (QA) task. We systematically experiment with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) of teacher only, SFT of student only and SFT of both prior to KD. We design experiments to study the impact of vocabulary (same and different) and KD algorithms (vanilla KD and Dual Space KD, DSKD) on the distilled model. Multi-faceted evaluation of the distillation using 14 different metrics (N-gram, embedding and LLM-based metrics) is considered. Experimental results show that SFT of teacher improves performance of distilled model when both models have same vocabulary, irrespective of algorithm and metrics. Overall, SFT of both teacher and student results in better performance across all metrics, although the statistical significance of the same depends on the vocabulary of the teacher models.

Abstract: Since the emergence of autonomous driving technology, it has advanced rapidly over the past decade. It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous vehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the roads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant challenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting with surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of surrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change decision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors but also predicting their future motions without any direct communication. However, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of surrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a social intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), coupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework can be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated environment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach enhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on roads.

Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant effectiveness across various languages, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts. Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual understanding capabilities of current LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B (target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

Abstract: The ability to explain why a machine learning model arrives at a particular prediction is crucial when used as decision support by human operators of critical systems. The provided explanations must be provably correct, and preferably without redundant information, called minimal explanations. In this paper, we aim at finding explanations for predictions made by tree ensembles that are not only minimal, but also minimum with respect to a cost function.
  To this end, we first present a highly efficient oracle that can determine the correctness of explanations, surpassing the runtime performance of current state-of-the-art alternatives by several orders of magnitude when computing minimal explanations.
  Secondly, we adapt an algorithm called MARCO from related works (calling it m-MARCO) for the purpose of computing a single minimum explanation per prediction, and demonstrate an overall speedup factor of two compared to the MARCO algorithm which enumerates all minimal explanations.
  Finally, we study the obtained explanations from a range of use cases, leading to further insights of their characteristics. In particular, we observe that in several cases, there are more than 100,000 minimal explanations to choose from for a single prediction. In these cases, we see that only a small portion of the minimal explanations are also minimum, and that the minimum explanations are significantly less verbose, hence motivating the aim of this work.

Abstract: Online texts with toxic content are a clear threat to the users on social media in particular and society in general. Although many platforms have adopted various measures (e.g., machine learning-based hate-speech detection systems) to diminish their effect, toxic content writers have also attempted to evade such measures by using cleverly modified toxic words, so-called human-written text perturbations. Therefore, to help build automatic detection tools to recognize those perturbations, prior methods have developed sophisticated techniques to generate diverse adversarial samples. However, we note that these ``algorithms"-generated perturbations do not necessarily capture all the traits of ``human"-written perturbations. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset of human-written perturbations, named as NoisyHate, that was created from real-life perturbations that are both written and verified by human-in-the-loop. We show that perturbations in NoisyHate have different characteristics than prior algorithm-generated toxic datasets show, and thus can be in particular useful to help develop better toxic speech detection solutions. We thoroughly validate NoisyHate against state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, and black box APIs, such as Perspective API, on two tasks, such as perturbation normalization and understanding.

Abstract: In the field of computer vision, fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a prevalent strategy for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tasks. Different from most prior work that has focused on advancing learning algorithms, we systematically examined how pre-trained model size, pre-training dataset size, and training strategies impact generalization and confidence calibration on downstream tasks. We evaluated 100 models across diverse pre-trained model sizes, five pre-training datasets, and five data augmentations through extensive experiments on four distribution shift datasets totaling over 120,000 GPU hours. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of pre-trained model selection, with optimal choices substantially improving OOD accuracy over algorithm improvement alone. Additionally, we find that larger models and bigger pre-training datasets not only enhance OOD performance but also improve calibration, helping to mitigate overconfidence, contrary to some prior studies that found modern deep networks to calibrate worse than classical shallow models. Our work underscores the overlooked importance of pre-trained model selection for out-of-distribution generalization and calibration.

Abstract: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This study aims to use machine learning approaches to analyze longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) of patients with AD and identify signs and symptoms that can predict AD onset earlier. We used a case-control design with longitudinal EHRs from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2004 to 2021. Cases were VHA patients with AD diagnosed after 1/1/2016 based on ICD-10-CM codes, matched 1:9 with controls by age, sex and clinical utilization with replacement. We used a panel of AD-related keywords and their occurrences over time in a patient's longitudinal EHRs as predictors for AD prediction with four machine learning models. We performed subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and validated the model in a hold-out and "unseen" VHA stations group. Model discrimination, calibration, and other relevant metrics were reported for predictions up to ten years before ICD-based diagnosis. The study population included 16,701 cases and 39,097 matched controls. The average number of AD-related keywords (e.g., "concentration", "speaking") per year increased rapidly for cases as diagnosis approached, from around 10 to over 40, while remaining flat at 10 for controls. The best model achieved high discriminative accuracy (ROCAUC 0.997) for predictions using data from at least ten years before ICD-based diagnoses. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.99) and consistent across subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity, except for patients younger than 65 (ROCAUC 0.746). Machine learning models using AD-related keywords identified from EHR notes can predict future AD diagnoses, suggesting its potential use for identifying AD risk using EHR notes, offering an affordable way for early screening on large population.

Abstract: When each edge device of a network only perceives a local part of the environment, collaborative inference across multiple devices is often needed to predict global properties of the environment. In safety-critical applications, collaborative inference must be robust to significant network failures caused by environmental disruptions or extreme weather. Existing collaborative learning approaches, such as privacy-focused Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), typically assume a centralized setup or that one device never fails. However, these assumptions make prior approaches susceptible to significant network failures. To address this problem, we first formalize the problem of robust collaborative inference over a dynamic network of devices that could experience significant network faults. Then, we develop a minimalistic yet impactful method called Multiple Aggregation with Gossip Rounds and Simulated Faults (MAGS) that synthesizes simulated faults via dropout, replication, and gossiping to significantly improve robustness over baselines. We also theoretically analyze our proposed approach to explain why each component enhances robustness. Extensive empirical results validate that MAGS is robust across a range of fault rates-including extreme fault rates.

Abstract: We present conservative distributed multi-task learning in stochastic linear contextual bandits with heterogeneous agents. This extends conservative linear bandits to a distributed setting where M agents tackle different but related tasks while adhering to stage-wise performance constraints. The exact context is unknown, and only a context distribution is available to the agents as in many practical applications that involve a prediction mechanism to infer context, such as stock market prediction and weather forecast. We propose a distributed upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, DiSC-UCB. Our algorithm constructs a pruned action set during each round to ensure the constraints are met. Additionally, it includes synchronized sharing of estimates among agents via a central server using well-structured synchronization steps. We prove the regret and communication bounds on the algorithm. We extend the problem to a setting where the agents are unaware of the baseline reward. For this setting, we provide a modified algorithm, DiSC-UCB2, and we show that the modified algorithm achieves the same regret and communication bounds. We empirically validated the performance of our algorithm on synthetic data and real-world Movielens-100K data.

Abstract: Issues can arise when research focused on fairness, transparency, or safety is conducted separately from research driven by practical deployment concerns and vice versa. This separation creates a growing need for translational work that bridges the gap between independently studied concepts that may be fundamentally related. This paper explores connections between two seemingly unrelated concepts of predictive inconsistency that share intriguing parallels. The first, known as predictive multiplicity, occurs when models that perform similarly (e.g., nearly equivalent training loss) produce conflicting predictions for individual samples. This concept is often emphasized in algorithmic fairness research as a means of promoting transparency in ML model development. The second concept, predictive churn, examines the differences in individual predictions before and after model updates, a key challenge in deploying ML models in consumer-facing applications. We present theoretical and empirical results that uncover links between these previously disconnected concepts.

<title>Hyperparameters in Continual Learning: A Reality Check</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train a model on a sequence of tasks (i.e., a CL scenario) while balancing the trade-off between plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (retaining prior knowledge). The dominantly adopted conventional evaluation protocol for CL algorithms selects the best hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, mini-batch size, regularization strengths, etc.) within a given scenario and then evaluates the algorithms using these hyperparameters in the same scenario. However, this protocol has significant shortcomings: it overestimates the CL capacity of algorithms and relies on unrealistic hyperparameter tuning, which is not feasible for real-world applications. From the fundamental principles of evaluation in machine learning, we argue that the evaluation of CL algorithms should focus on assessing the generalizability of their CL capacity to unseen scenarios. Based on this, we propose the Generalizable Two-phase Evaluation Protocol (GTEP) consisting of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation phases. Both phases share the same scenario configuration (e.g., number of tasks) but are generated from different datasets. Hyperparameters of CL algorithms are tuned in the first phase and applied in the second phase to evaluate the algorithms. We apply this protocol to class-incremental learning, both with and without pretrained models. Across more than 8,000 experiments, our results show that most state-of-the-art algorithms fail to replicate their reported performance, highlighting that their CL capacity has been significantly overestimated in the conventional evaluation protocol. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/GTEP.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4--5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.

Abstract: In meteorology, finding similar weather patterns or analogs in historical datasets can be useful for data assimilation, forecasting, and postprocessing. In climate science, analogs in historical and climate projection data are used for attribution and impact studies. However, most of the time, those large weather and climate datasets are nearline. This means that they must be downloaded, which takes a lot of bandwidth and disk space, before the computationally expensive search can be executed. We propose a dimension reduction technique based on autoencoder (AE) neural networks to compress the datasets and perform the search in an interpretable, compressed latent space. A distance-regularized Siamese twin autoencoder (DIRESA) architecture is designed to preserve distance in latent space while capturing the nonlinearities in the datasets. Using conceptual climate models of different complexities, we show that the latent components thus obtained provide physical insight into the dominant modes of variability in the system. Compressing datasets with DIRESA reduces the online storage and keeps the latent components uncorrelated, while the distance (ordering) preservation and reconstruction fidelity robustly outperform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and other dimension reduction techniques such as UMAP or variational autoencoders.

Abstract: We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps. We evaluated our method on 15 complex 3D indoor environments, with 4 additional scenarios later included in the results, showcasing the generalizability of the model across diverse conditions. Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.

Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild statistical assumptions. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.

Abstract: We investigate the implications of removing bias in ReLU networks regarding their expressivity and learning dynamics. We first show that two-layer bias-free ReLU networks have limited expressivity: the only odd function two-layer bias-free ReLU networks can express is a linear one. We then show that, under symmetry conditions on the data, these networks have the same learning dynamics as linear networks. This enables us to give analytical time-course solutions to certain two-layer bias-free (leaky) ReLU networks outside the lazy learning regime. While deep bias-free ReLU networks are more expressive than their two-layer counterparts, they still share a number of similarities with deep linear networks. These similarities enable us to leverage insights from linear networks to understand certain ReLU networks. Overall, our results show that some properties previously established for bias-free ReLU networks arise due to equivalence to linear networks.

Abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) leverage a compositional structure to model non-stationary processes. DGPs typically rely on local inducing point approximations across intermediate GP layers. Recent advances in DGP inference have shown that incorporating global Fourier features from the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) can enhance the DGPs' capability to capture complex non-stationary patterns. This paper extends the use of these features to compositional GPs involving linear transformations. In particular, we introduce Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE)--based RKHS Fourier features that allow for adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through convolution operations. This convolutional formulation relates our work to recently proposed deep latent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling nonlinear dynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features within a doubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved predictive performance across various regression tasks.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are essential but labor-intensive due to high publication volumes and inefficient keyword-based filtering. To streamline this process, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing efficiency and accuracy in corpus filtration while minimizing manual effort. Our open-source tool LLMSurver presents a visual interface to utilize LLMs for literature filtration, evaluate the results, and refine queries in an interactive way. We assess the real-world performance of our approach in filtering over 8.3k articles during a recent survey construction, comparing results with human efforts. The findings show that recent LLM models can reduce filtering time from weeks to minutes. A consensus scheme ensures recall rates >98.8%, surpassing typical human error thresholds and improving selection accuracy. This work advances literature review methodologies and highlights the potential of responsible human-AI collaboration in academic research.

Abstract: The computationally cheap machine learning architecture of random feature maps can be viewed as a single-layer feedforward network in which the weights of the hidden layer are random but fixed and only the outer weights are learned via linear regression. The internal weights are typically chosen from a prescribed distribution. The choice of the internal weights significantly impacts the accuracy of random feature maps. We address here the task of how to best select the internal weights. In particular, we consider the forecasting problem whereby random feature maps are used to learn a one-step propagator map for a dynamical system. We provide a computationally cheap hit-and-run algorithm to select good internal weights which lead to good forecasting skill. We show that the number of good features is the main factor controlling the forecasting skill of random feature maps and acts as an effective feature dimension. Lastly, we compare random feature maps with single-layer feedforward neural networks in which the internal weights are now learned using gradient descent. We find that random feature maps have superior forecasting capabilities whilst having several orders of magnitude lower computational cost.

Abstract: Classification of sets of inputs (e.g., images and texts) is an active area of research within both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). A common way to represent a set of vectors is to model them as linear subspaces. In this contribution, we present a prototype-based approach for learning on the manifold formed from such linear subspaces, the Grassmann manifold. Our proposed method learns a set of subspace prototypes capturing the representative characteristics of classes and a set of relevance factors automating the selection of the dimensionality of the subspaces. This leads to a transparent classifier model which presents the computed impact of each input vector on its decision. Through experiments on benchmark image and text datasets, we have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed classifier, compared to the transformer-based models in terms of not only performance and explainability but also computational resource requirements.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic graphs, such as those found in social networks, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms, is crucial for capturing evolving relationships and delivering relevant insights over time. Traditional approaches primarily rely on graph neural networks with temporal components or sequence generation models, which often focus narrowly on the historical context of target nodes. This limitation restricts the ability to adapt to new and emerging patterns in dynamic graphs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Graph modeling (RAG4DyG), which enhances dynamic graph predictions by incorporating contextually and temporally relevant examples from broader graph structures. Our approach includes a time- and context-aware contrastive learning module to identify high-quality demonstrations and a graph fusion strategy to effectively integrate these examples with historical contexts. The proposed framework is designed to be effective in both transductive and inductive scenarios, ensuring adaptability to previously unseen nodes and evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAG4DyG in improving predictive accuracy and adaptability for dynamic graph modeling. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiaWu/RAG4DyG.

Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.

Abstract: QUIC, a new and increasingly used transport protocol, enhances TCP by offering improved security, performance, and stream multiplexing. These features, however, also impose challenges for network middle-boxes that need to monitor and analyze web traffic. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of HTTP/3 responses in a given QUIC connection by an observer. This estimation reveals server behavior, client-server interactions, and data transmission efficiency, which is crucial for various applications such as designing a load balancing solution and detecting HTTP/3 flood attacks. The proposed scheme transforms QUIC connection traces into image sequences and uses machine learning (ML) models, guided by a tailored loss function, to predict response counts. Evaluations on more than seven million images-derived from 100,000 traces collected across 44,000 websites over four months-achieve up to 97% accuracy in both known and unknown server settings and 92% accuracy on previously unseen complete QUIC traces.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.

Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.

Abstract: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the consistency of rewards across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Raibows/CREAM.

Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are typically constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. We propose a methodology that enables simulating populations of Reinforcement Learning agents at evolutionary scale. More specifically, we derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Policy Gradient (PG) and Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), tailored for evolutionary simulations where agents undergo random pairwise interactions in stateless normal-form games. We demonstrate our approach by simulating the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. In our experiments, 200,000 PG or LOLA agents evolve in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game provides distinct insights into how populations evolve under both naive and advanced MARL rules, including compelling ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects social evolution.

<title>Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models</title>

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while matching synchronous accuracy.

Abstract: Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4% in IID and up to 15.8% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2%.

<title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>

Abstract: Timely updating of Internet of Things (IoT) data is crucial for immersive vehicular metaverse services. However, challenges such as latency caused by massive data transmissions, privacy risks associated with user data, and computational burdens on metaverse service providers (MSPs) hinder continuous collection of high-quality data. To address these issues, we propose an immersion-aware model trading framework that facilitates data provision for services while ensuring privacy through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional metric, the immersion of model (IoM), which assesses model value comprehensively by considering freshness and accuracy of learning models, as well as the amount and potential value of raw data used for training. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to incentivize metaverse users (MUs) to contribute high-value models under resource constraints. The trading interactions between MSPs and MUs are modeled as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains, where MSPs as leaders determine rewards, while MUs as followers optimize resource allocation. Furthermore, considering dynamic network conditions and privacy concerns, we formulate the reward decisions of MSPs as a multi-agent Markov decision process. To solve this, we develop a fully distributed dynamic reward algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, without accessing any private information about MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving improvements in IoM of 38.3% and 37.2%, and reductions in training time to reach the target accuracy of 43.5% and 49.8%, on average, for the MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been a major goal of psychology. While there have been previous attempts to instantiate such theories by building computational models, we currently do not have one model that captures the human mind in its entirety. A first step in this direction is to create a model that can predict human behavior in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behavior in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on a novel, large-scale data set called Psych-101. Psych-101 reaches an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from over 60,000 participants performing over 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behavior of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but also generalizes to new cover stories, structural task modifications, and entirely new domains. Furthermore, we find that the model's internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after finetuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behavior across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories and present a case study to demonstrate this.

<title>ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

Abstract: It has recently been demonstrated empirically that in-context learning emerges in transformers when certain distributional properties are present in the training data, but this ability can also diminish upon further training. We provide a new theoretical understanding of these phenomena by identifying simplified distributional properties that give rise to the emergence and eventual disappearance of in-context learning. We do so by first analyzing a simplified model that uses a gating mechanism to choose between an in-weight and an in-context predictor. Through a combination of a generalization error and regret analysis we identify conditions where in-context and in-weight learning emerge. These theoretical findings are then corroborated experimentally by comparing the behaviour of a full transformer on the simplified distributions to that of the stylized model, demonstrating aligned results. We then extend the study to a full large language model, showing how fine-tuning on various collections of natural language prompts can elicit similar in-context and in-weight learning behaviour.

Abstract: The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved $74.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $87.38\%$ on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached $67.00\%$ test accuracy and an AUC of $68.20\%$, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving $88.10\%$ and $74.80\%$ test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.

Abstract: We consider fair resource allocation in sequential decision-making environments modeled as weakly coupled Markov decision processes, where resource constraints couple the action spaces of $N$ sub-Markov decision processes (sub-MDPs) that would otherwise operate independently. We adopt a fairness definition using the generalized Gini function instead of the traditional utilitarian (total-sum) objective. After introducing a general but computationally prohibitive solution scheme based on linear programming, we focus on the homogeneous case where all sub-MDPs are identical. For this case, we show for the first time that the problem reduces to optimizing the utilitarian objective over the class of "permutation invariant" policies. This result is particularly useful as we can exploit Whittle index policies in the restless bandits setting while, for the more general setting, we introduce a count-proportion-based deep reinforcement learning approach. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method in achieving fairness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks. Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.

Abstract: While deep-learning models have demonstrated skillful El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts up to one year in advance, they are predominantly trained on climate model simulations that provide thousands of years of training data at the expense of introducing climate model biases. Simpler Linear Inverse Models (LIMs) trained on the much shorter observational record also make skillful ENSO predictions but do not capture predictable nonlinear processes. This motivates a hybrid approach, combining the LIMs modest data needs with a deep-learning non-Markovian correction of the LIM. For O(100 yr) datasets, our resulting Hybrid model is more skillful than the LIM while also exceeding the skill of a full deep-learning model. Additionally, while the most predictable ENSO events are still identified in advance by the LIM, they are better predicted by the Hybrid model, especially in the western tropical Pacific for leads beyond about 9 months, by capturing the subsequent asymmetric (warm versus cold phases) evolution of ENSO.

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring focuses on forecasting future states of ongoing process executions, such as predicting the outcome of a particular case. In recent years, the application of machine learning models in this domain has garnered significant scientific attention. When using historical execution data, which may contain biases or exhibit unfair behavior, these biases may be encoded into the trained models. Consequently, when such models are deployed to make decisions or guide interventions for new cases, they risk perpetuating this unwanted behavior. This work addresses group fairness in predictive process monitoring by investigating independence, i.e. ensuring predictions are unaffected by sensitive group membership. We explore independence through metrics for demographic parity such as $\Delta$DP, as well as recently introduced, threshold-independent distribution-based alternatives. Additionally, we propose a composite loss function existing of binary cross-entropy and a distribution-based loss (Wasserstein) to train models that balance predictive performance and fairness, and allow for customizable trade-offs. The effectiveness of both the fairness metrics and the composite loss functions is validated through a controlled experimental setup.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent. Our code is available at https://github.com/HKBU-LAGAS/Locle.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is a fundamental task in transportation research, however the scope of current research has mainly focused on a single data modality of loop detectors. Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have made possible novel solutions for efficient, accurate and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drone-captured data can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of multi-source traffic speed prediction, simultaneously using drone and loop detector data. A simple yet effective graph-based model HiMSNet is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestions and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverages and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the added value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.

Abstract: We study the problem of online clustering within the multi-armed bandit framework under the fixed confidence setting. In this multi-armed bandit problem, we have $M$ arms, each providing i.i.d. samples that follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with an {\em unknown} mean and a known unit covariance. The arms are grouped into $K$ clusters based on the distance between their means using the Single Linkage (SLINK) clustering algorithm on the means of the arms. Since the true means are unknown, the objective is to obtain the above clustering of the arms with the minimum number of samples drawn from the arms, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We introduce a novel algorithm, Average Tracking Bandit Online Clustering (ATBOC), and prove that this algorithm is order optimal, meaning that the upper bound on its expected sample complexity for given error probability $\delta$ is within a factor of 2 of an instance-dependent lower bound as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, we propose a computationally more efficient algorithm, Lower and Upper Confidence Bound-based Bandit Online Clustering (LUCBBOC), inspired by the LUCB algorithm for best arm identification. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of LUCBBOC is comparable to that of ATBOC. We numerically assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on both synthetic datasets and the real-world MovieLens dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on bandit online clustering that allows arms with different means in a cluster and $K$ greater than 2.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of integrated circuit design, detecting Hardware Trojans (HTs) within a multi entity based design cycle presents significant challenges. This research proposes an innovative machine learning-based methodology for identifying malicious logic gates in gate-level netlists. By focusing on path retrace algorithms. The methodology is validated across three distinct cases, each employing different machine learning models to classify HTs. Case I utilizes a decision tree algorithm for node-to-node comparisons, significantly improving detection accuracy through the integration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Case II introduces a graph-to-graph classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model, enabling the differentiation between normal and Trojan-infected circuit designs. Case III applies GNN-based node classification to identify individual compromised nodes and its location. Additionally, nearest neighbor (NN) method has been combined with GNN graph-to-graph in Case II and GNN node-to-node in Case III. Despite the potential of GNN model graph-to-graph classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the first nearest neighbor (1st NN) achieving 73.2% accuracy and the second nearest neighbor (2nd NN) method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 62.8%. Similarly, GNN model node-to-node classification, NN approach demonstrated superior performance, with the 1st NN achieving 93% accuracy and the 2nd NN method reaching 97.7%. In comparison, the GNN model achieved an accuracy of 79.8%. However, higher and higher NN will lead to large code coverage for the identification of HTs.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop optimization (HILO) is a promising approach for personalizing visual prostheses by iteratively refining stimulus parameters based on user feedback. Previous work demonstrated HILO's efficacy in simulation, but its performance with human participants remains untested. Here we evaluate HILO using sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision to assess its ability to optimize stimulation strategies under realistic conditions. Participants selected between phosphenes generated by competing encoders to iteratively refine a deep stimulus encoder (DSE). We tested HILO in three conditions: standard optimization, threshold misspecifications, and out-of-distribution parameter sampling. Participants consistently preferred HILO-generated stimuli over both a naive encoder and the DSE alone, with log odds favoring HILO across all conditions. We also observed key differences between human and simulated decision-making, highlighting the importance of validating optimization strategies with human participants. These findings support HILO as a viable approach for adapting visual prostheses to individuals. Clinical relevance: Validating HILO with sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision is an important step toward personalized calibration of future visual prostheses.

<title>Implicit bias of Normalized Steepest Descent in Multiclass Classification: Sign Descent, Spectral Descent, and Adam</title>

Abstract: In the optimization of overparameterized models, different gradient-based methods can achieve zero training error yet converge to distinctly different solutions inducing different generalization properties. Despite a decade of research on implicit optimization bias, important questions remain open even in the foundational case of linear classification with separable data. We address this gap by characterizing the implicit bias of both Adam and Sign gradient descent (SignGD) in multi-class cross-entropy minimization: we prove that their iterates converge to solutions maximizing the margin with respect to the classifier matrix's max-norm, and we establish the corresponding convergence rates. We then generalize our analysis to p-norm normalized steepest descent (NSD) algorithms. This includes Spectral Descent, which we show converges to the max-margin solution with respect to the spectral norm. A key insight is that the analysis of general entry-wise and Schatten p-norms can be reduced to the analysis of NSD with max-norm (i.e., SignGD) by exploiting a natural ordering property between all p-norms relative to the max-norm and its dual sum-norm. Our results demonstrate that the multi-class linear setting, which is inherently richer than the binary counterpart, provides the most transparent playground for studying implicit biases of matrix-parameter optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Federated Learning is vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, where malicious clients can inject poisoned updates to influence the global model's behavior. While existing defense mechanisms have made notable progress, they fail to protect against adversaries that aim to induce targeted backdoors under different learning and attack configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce DROP (Distillation-based Reduction Of Poisoning), a novel defense mechanism that combines clustering and activity-tracking techniques with extraction of benign behavior from clients via knowledge distillation to tackle stealthy adversaries that manipulate low data poisoning rates and diverse malicious client ratios within the federation. Through extensive experimentation, our approach demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing defenses across a wide range of learning configurations. Finally, we evaluate existing defenses and our method under the challenging setting of non-IID client data distribution and highlight the challenges of designing a resilient FL defense in this setting.

Abstract: Learning well-separated features in high-dimensional spaces, such as text or image embeddings, is crucial for many machine learning applications. Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) models are transforming many scientific disciplines. However, the development of good modeling practices to increase the trustworthiness of SciML has lagged behind its application, limiting its potential impact. The goal of this paper is to start a discussion on establishing consensus-based good practices for predictive SciML. We identify key challenges in applying existing computational science and engineering guidelines, such as verification and validation protocols, and provide recommendations to address these challenges. Our discussion focuses on predictive SciML, which uses machine learning models to learn, improve, and accelerate numerical simulations of physical systems. While centered on predictive applications, our 16 recommendations aim to help researchers conduct and document their modeling processes rigorously across all SciML domains.

Abstract: We evaluate methods for causal representation learning (CRL) on a simple, real-world system where these methods are expected to work. The system consists of a controlled optical experiment specifically built for this purpose, which satisfies the core assumptions of CRL and where the underlying causal factors (the inputs to the experiment) are known, providing a ground truth. We select methods representative of different approaches to CRL and find that they all fail to recover the underlying causal factors. To understand the failure modes of the evaluated algorithms, we perform an ablation on the data by substituting the real data-generating process with a simpler synthetic equivalent. The results reveal a reproducibility problem, as most methods already fail on this synthetic ablation despite its simple data-generating process. Additionally, we observe that common assumptions on the mixing function are crucial for the performance of some of the methods but do not hold in the real data. Our efforts highlight the contrast between the theoretical promise of the state of the art and the challenges in its application. We hope the benchmark serves as a simple, real-world sanity check to further develop and validate methodology, bridging the gap towards CRL methods that work in practice. We make all code and datasets publicly available at github.com/simonbing/CRLSanityCheck

Abstract: Cybersecurity threats are growing, making network intrusion detection essential. Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.

<title>Differential Privacy Personalized Federated Learning Based on Dynamically Sparsified Client Updates</title>

Abstract: Personalized federated learning is extensively utilized in scenarios characterized by data heterogeneity, facilitating more efficient and automated local training on data-owning terminals. This includes the automated selection of high-performance model parameters for upload, thereby enhancing the overall training process. However, it entails significant risks of privacy leakage. Existing studies have attempted to mitigate these risks by utilizing differential privacy. Nevertheless, these studies present two major limitations: (1) The integration of differential privacy into personalized federated learning lacks sufficient personalization, leading to the introduction of excessive noise into the model. (2) It fails to adequately control the spatial scope of model update information, resulting in a suboptimal balance between data privacy and model effectiveness in differential privacy federated learning. In this paper, we propose a differentially private personalized federated learning approach that employs dynamically sparsified client updates through reparameterization and adaptive norm(DP-pFedDSU). Reparameterization training effectively selects personalized client update information, thereby reducing the quantity of updates. This approach minimizes the introduction of noise to the greatest extent possible. Additionally, dynamic adaptive norm refers to controlling the norm space of model updates during the training process, mitigating the negative impact of clipping on the update information. These strategies substantially enhance the effective integration of differential privacy and personalized federated learning. Experimental results on EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves superior performance and is well-suited for more complex personalized federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.

Abstract: Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.

<title>Permutation Learning with Only N Parameters: From SoftSort to Self-Organizing Gaussians</title>

Abstract: Sorting and permutation learning are key concepts in optimization and machine learning, especially when organizing high-dimensional data into meaningful spatial layouts. The Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, while effective, requires N*N parameters to determine a full permutation matrix, making it computationally expensive for large datasets. Low-rank matrix factorization approximations reduce memory requirements to 2NM (with M << N), but they still struggle with very large problems. SoftSort, by providing a continuous relaxation of the argsort operator, allows differentiable 1D sorting, but it faces challenges with multidimensional data and complex permutations. In this paper, we present a novel method for learning permutations using only N parameters, which dramatically reduces storage costs. Our method extends SoftSort by iteratively shuffling the N indices of the elements and applying a few SoftSort optimization steps per iteration. This modification significantly improves sorting quality, especially for multidimensional data and complex optimization criteria, and outperforms pure SoftSort. Our method offers improved memory efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches, while maintaining high-quality permutation learning. Its dramatically reduced memory requirements make it particularly well-suited for large-scale optimization tasks, such as "Self-Organizing Gaussians", where efficient and scalable permutation learning is critical.

Abstract: Recent remarkable advances in learning theory have established that, for total concept classes, list replicability, global stability, differentially private (DP) learnability, and shared-randomness replicability all coincide with the finiteness of Littlestone dimension. Does this equivalence extend to partial concept classes?
  We answer this question by proving that the list replicability number of $d$-dimensional $\gamma$-margin half-spaces satisfies \[ \frac{d}{2}+1 \le \mathrm{LR}(H^d_\gamma) \le d, \] which grows with dimension. Consequently, for partial classes, list replicability and global stability do not necessarily follow from bounded Littlestone dimension, pure DP-learnability, or shared-randomness replicability.
  Applying our main theorem, we resolve several open problems:
  $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of infinite-dimensional large-margin half-spaces to a total concept class has unbounded Littlestone dimension, answering an open question of Alon et al. (FOCS '21).
  $\bullet$ The maximum list-replicability number of any finite set of points and homogeneous half-spaces in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $d$, resolving a problem of Chase et al. (FOCS '23).
  $\bullet$ Every disambiguation of the Gap Hamming Distance problem in the large gap regime has unbounded public-coin randomized communication complexity. This answers an open question of Fang et al. (STOC '25).
  $\bullet$ There exists a partial concept class with Littlestone dimension $1$ such that all its disambiguations have infinite Littlestone dimension. This answers a question of Cheung et al. (ICALP '23).
  Our lower bound follows from a topological argument based on the local Borsuk-Ulam theorem of Chase, Chornomaz, Moran, and Yehudayoff (STOC '24). For the upper bound, we construct a list-replicable learning rule using the generalization properties of SVMs.

Our algorithm leverages the Bregman proximal gradient framework to overcome the challenge of estimating the global $L$-smooth constant in the classic proximal gradient algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our model and algorithm.

Abstract: In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of LLMs has prompted researchers to integrate language descriptions into graphs, aiming to enhance model encoding capabilities from a data-centric perspective. This graph representation is called text-attributed graphs (TAGs). A review of prior advancements highlights that graph structure learning (GSL) is a pivotal technique for improving data utility, making it highly relevant to efficient TAG learning. However, most GSL methods are tailored for traditional graphs without textual information, underscoring the necessity of developing a new GSL paradigm. Despite clear motivations, it remains challenging: (1) How can we define a reasonable optimization objective for GSL in the era of LLMs, considering the massive parameters in LLM? (2) How can we design an efficient model architecture that enables seamless integration of LLM for this optimization objective? For Question 1, we reformulate existing GSL optimization objectives as a tree optimization framework, shifting the focus from obtaining a well-trained edge predictor to a language-aware tree sampler. For Question 2, we propose decoupled and training-free model design principles for LLM integration, shifting the focus from computation-intensive fine-tuning to more efficient inference. Based on this, we propose Large Language and Tree Assistant (LLaTA), which leverages tree-based LLM in-context learning to enhance the understanding of topology and text, enabling reliable inference and generating improved graph structure. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that LLaTA enjoys flexibility-incorporated with any backbone; scalability-outperforms other LLM-enhanced graph learning methods; effectiveness-achieves SOTA predictive performance.

Abstract: The integration of heterogeneous multi-omics datasets at a systems level remains a central challenge for developing analytical and computational models in precision cancer diagnostics. This paper introduces Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning framework that utilizes messenger-RNA, micro-RNA sequences, and DNA methylation samples together with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for cancer classification across 31 different cancer types. The proposed approach combines differential gene expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle and uses trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and exhibits low experimental variability in comparison to related deep learning-based models. The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN were validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates robust predictive performance and interpretability with potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.

Abstract: We study regret minimization under privacy constraints in episodic inhomogeneous linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), motivated by the growing use of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized decision-making systems that rely on sensitive user data. In this setting, both transition probabilities and reward functions are assumed to be linear in a feature mapping $\phi(s, a)$, and we aim to ensure privacy through joint differential privacy (JDP), a relaxation of differential privacy suited to online learning. Prior work has established suboptimal regret bounds by privatizing the LSVI-UCB algorithm, which achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3 H^4 K})$ regret in the non-private setting. Building on recent advances that improve this to near minimax optimal regret $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{H^{3}K})$ via LSVI-UCB++ with Bernstein-style bonuses, we design a new differentially private algorithm by privatizing LSVI-UCB++ and adapting techniques for variance-aware analysis from offline RL. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + H^{15/4} d^{7/6} K^{1/2} / \epsilon)$, improving over previous private methods. Empirical results show that our algorithm retains near-optimal utility compared to non-private baselines, indicating that privacy can be achieved with minimal performance degradation in this setting.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become increasingly popular and deployed in safety-critical applications. In such applications, we want to give certified probabilistic guarantees on performance under adversarial attacks. We propose a novel method, CIVET, for certified training of VAEs. CIVET depends on the key insight that we can bound worst-case VAE error by bounding the error on carefully chosen support sets at the latent layer. We show this point mathematically and present a novel training algorithm utilizing this insight. We show in an extensive evaluation across different datasets (in both the wireless and vision application areas), architectures, and perturbation magnitudes that our method outperforms SOTA methods achieving good standard performance with strong robustness guarantees.

Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

<title>Precise High-Dimensional Asymptotics for Quantifying Heterogeneous Transfers</title>

Abstract: The problem of learning one task with samples from another task is central to transfer learning (TL). In this paper, we examine a fundamental question: When does combining the data samples from a source task and a target task perform better than single-task learning with the target task alone? This question is motivated by an intriguing phenomenon known as negative transfer often observed in the TL literature. Precise quantification of TL effects -- even within simple statistical models -- has remained elusive in the statistical learning literature. A critical challenge is that to compare TL to single-task learning, we would need to compare the risks between two different estimators in a very precise way. In particular, the comparative advantage of one estimator over another would depend on the specific distribution shifts between the two tasks. This paper applies recent developments in the random matrix theory literature to tackle this challenge in a high-dimensional linear regression setting with two tasks. We provide precise high-dimensional asymptotics for the bias and variance of hard parameter sharing (HPS) estimators in the proportional limit, when the sample sizes of both tasks increase proportionally with dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics are expressed as a function of the sample sizes of both tasks, the covariate shift between their feature population covariate matrices, and the model shift. We provide illustrative examples of our results in a random-effects model to determine positive and negative transfers. For example, we can identify a phase transition in the high-dimensional linear regression setting from positive transfer to negative transfer under a model shift between the source and target tasks. The finding regarding phase transition can be extended to a multiple-task learning setting where the feature covariates are shared across all tasks.

<title>A Bayesian approach to modeling topic-metadata relationships</title>

Abstract: The objective of advanced topic modeling is not only to explore latent topical structures, but also to estimate relationships between the discovered topics and theoretically relevant metadata. Methods used to estimate such relationships must take into account that the topical structure is not directly observed, but instead being estimated itself in an unsupervised fashion, usually by common topic models. A frequently used procedure to achieve this is the method of composition, a Monte Carlo sampling technique performing multiple repeated linear regressions of sampled topic proportions on metadata covariates. In this paper, we propose two modifications of this approach: First, we substantially refine the existing implementation of the method of composition from the R package stm by replacing linear regression with the more appropriate Beta regression. Second, we provide a fundamental enhancement of the entire estimation framework by substituting the current blending of frequentist and Bayesian methods with a fully Bayesian approach. This allows for a more appropriate quantification of uncertainty. We illustrate our improved methodology by investigating relationships between Twitter posts by German parliamentarians and different metadata covariates related to their electoral districts, using the Structural Topic Model to estimate topic proportions.

<title>Understanding Dataset Difficulty with $\mathcal{V}$-Usable Information</title>

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficulty -- w.r.t. a model $\mathcal{V}$ -- as the lack of $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ (Xu et al., 2019), where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for $\mathcal{V}$. We further introduce $\textit{pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-information}$ (PVI) for measuring the difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution. While standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset, $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ and PVI also permit the converse: for a given model $\mathcal{V}$, we can compare different datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same dataset. Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different input attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover annotation artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to enable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) for Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM), also known as Energy Disaggregation, through Bayesian Optimization. NIALM offers a cost-effective alternative to smart meters for measuring the energy consumption of electric devices and appliances. NIALM methods analyze the entire power consumption signal of a household and predict the type of appliances as well as their individual power consumption (i.e., their contributions to the aggregated signal). We enable NIALM domain experts and practitioners who typically have no deep data analytics or Machine Learning (ML) skills to benefit from state-of-the-art ML approaches to NIALM. Further, we conduct a survey and benchmarking of the state of the art and show that in many cases, simple and basic ML models and algorithms, such as Decision Trees, outperform the state of the art. Finally, we present our open-source tool, AutoML4NIALM, which will facilitate the exploitation of existing methods for NIALM in the industry.

Abstract: The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses challenges for manual knowledge curation and synthesis. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines.
  We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs, GPT and LLaMA representatives on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero or few shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps. We find issues like missing information and hallucinations in LLM outputs. These results offer practical insights for applying LLMs in BioNLP.

<title>Causal Q-Aggregation for CATE Model Selection</title>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is at the core of personalized decision making. While there is a plethora of models for CATE estimation, model selection is a nontrivial task, due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Recent empirical work provides evidence in favor of proxy loss metrics with double robust properties and in favor of model ensembling. However, theoretical understanding is lacking. Direct application of prior theoretical work leads to suboptimal oracle model selection rates due to the non-convexity of the model selection problem. We provide regret rates for the major existing CATE ensembling approaches and propose a new CATE model ensembling approach based on Q-aggregation using the doubly robust loss. Our main result shows that causal Q-aggregation achieves statistically optimal oracle model selection regret rates of $\frac{\log(M)}{n}$ (with $M$ models and $n$ samples), with the addition of higher-order estimation error terms related to products of errors in the nuisance functions. Crucially, our regret rate does not require that any of the candidate CATE models be close to the truth. We validate our new method on many semi-synthetic datasets and also provide extensions of our work to CATE model selection with instrumental variables and unobserved confounding.

<title>FetaFix: Automatic Fault Localization and Repair of Deep Learning Model Conversions</title>

Abstract: Converting deep learning models between frameworks is a common step to maximize model compatibility across devices and leverage optimization features that may be exclusively provided in one deep learning framework. However, this conversion process may be riddled with bugs, making the converted models either undeployable or problematic, considerably degrading their prediction correctness.
  In this paper, we propose an automated approach for fault localization and repair, FetaFix, during model conversion between deep learning frameworks. FetaFix is capable of detecting and fixing faults introduced in model input, parameters, hyperparameters, and the model graph during conversion. FetaFix uses a set of fault types (mined from surveying common conversion issues reported in code repositories and forums) to localize potential conversion faults in the converted target model and then repair them appropriately, e.g., replacing the parameters of the target model with those from the source model. This is done iteratively for every image in the dataset, comparing output label differences between the source model and the converted target model until all differences are resolved. We evaluate the effectiveness of FetaFix in fixing model conversion bugs of three widely used image recognition models converted across four different deep learning frameworks. Overall, FetaFix was able to fix $462$ out of $755$ detected conversion faults, either completely repairing or significantly improving the performance of $14$ out of the $15$ erroneous conversion cases.

<title>An $\ell^1$-Plug-and-Play Approach for MPI Using a Zero Shot Denoiser with Evaluation on the 3D Open MPI Dataset</title>

Abstract: Objective: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior.
  Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data.
  Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data.
  Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts.

<title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff Based on the Conditional-Distribution Perception Measure</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a memoryless source model in the asymptotic limit of large block-lengths. The perception measure is based on a divergence between the distributions of the source and reconstruction sequences \emph{conditioned} on the encoder output, first proposed by Mentzer et al. We consider the case when there is no shared randomness between the encoder and the decoder and derive a single-letter characterization of the RDP function for the case of discrete memoryless sources. This is in contrast to the marginal-distribution metric case (introduced by Blau and Michaeli), whose RDP characterization remains open when there is no shared randomness. The achievability scheme is based on lossy source coding with a posterior reference map. For the case of continuous valued sources under the squared error distortion measure and the squared quadratic Wasserstein perception measure, we also derive a single-letter characterization and show that the decoder can be restricted to a noise-adding mechanism. Interestingly, the RDP function characterized for the case of zero perception loss coincides with that of the marginal metric, and further zero perception loss can be achieved with a 3-dB penalty in minimum distortion. Finally we specialize to the case of Gaussian sources, and derive the RDP function for Gaussian vector case and propose a reverse water-filling type solution. We also partially characterize the RDP function for a mixture of Gaussian vector sources.

Abstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained widespread adoption for retrieval tasks due to its minimal requirement for manual annotations. However, popular training frameworks typically learn from binary (positive/negative) relevance, making them ineffective at incorporating desired rankings. As a result, the poor ranking performance of these models forces systems to employ a re-ranker, which increases complexity, maintenance effort and inference time. To address this, we introduce Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a training framework designed to learn from continuous ranking scores beyond binary relevance. GCL encodes both relevance and ranking information into a unified embedding space by applying ranking scores to the loss function. This enables a single-stage retrieval system. In addition, during our research, we identified a lack of public multi-modal datasets that benchmark both retrieval and ranking capabilities. To facilitate this and future research for ranked retrieval, we curated a large-scale MarqoGS-10M dataset using GPT-4 and Google Shopping, providing ranking scores for each of the 10 million query-document pairs. Our results show that GCL achieves a 29.3% increase in NDCG@10 for in-domain evaluations and 6.0% to 10.0% increases for cold-start evaluations compared to the finetuned CLIP baseline with MarqoGS-10M. Additionally, we evaluated GCL offline on a proprietary user interaction data. GCL shows an 11.2% gain for in-domain evaluations. The dataset and the method are available at: https://github.com/marqo-ai/GCL.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human motion intention (HMI) is beneficial for exoskeleton robots to improve the wearing comfort level and achieve natural human-robot interaction. A classifier trained on labeled source subjects (domains) performs poorly on unlabeled target subject since the difference in individual motor characteristics. The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method has become an effective way to this problem. However, the labeled data are collected from multiple source subjects that might be different not only from the target subject but also from each other. The current UDA methods for HMI recognition ignore the difference between each source subject, which reduces the classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper considers the differences between source subjects and develops a novel theory and algorithm for UDA to recognize HMI, where the margin disparity discrepancy (MDD) is extended to multi-source UDA theory and a novel weight-aware-based multi-source UDA algorithm (WMDD) is proposed. The source domain weight, which can be adjusted adaptively by the MDD between each source subject and target subject, is incorporated into UDA to measure the differences between source subjects. The developed multi-source UDA theory is theoretical and the generalization error on target subject is guaranteed. The theory can be transformed into an optimization problem for UDA, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. Moreover, a lightweight network is employed to guarantee the real-time of classification and the adversarial learning between feature generator and ensemble classifiers is utilized to further improve the generalization ability. The extensive experiments verify theoretical analysis and show that WMDD outperforms previous UDA methods on HMI recognition tasks.

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are extensively used in critical infrastructures ensuring efficient, reliable, and continuous operations. However, their increasing connectivity and addition of advanced features make them vulnerable to cyber threats, potentially leading to severe disruptions in essential services. In this context, honeypots play a vital role by acting as decoy targets within ICS networks, or on the Internet, helping to detect, log, analyze, and develop mitigations for ICS-specific cyber threats. Deploying ICS honeypots, however, is challenging due to the necessity of accurately replicating industrial protocols and device characteristics, a crucial requirement for effectively mimicking the unique operational behavior of different industrial systems. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the significant manual effort required in also mimicking the control logic the PLC would execute, in order to capture attacker traffic aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure operations. In this paper, we propose LLMPot, a novel approach for designing honeypots in ICS networks harnessing the potency of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMPot aims to automate and optimize the creation of realistic honeypots with vendor-agnostic configurations, and for any control logic, aiming to eliminate the manual effort and specialized knowledge traditionally required in this domain. We conducted extensive experiments focusing on a wide array of parameters, demonstrating that our LLM-based approach can effectively create honeypot devices implementing different industrial protocols and diverse control logic.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.

Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.

Abstract: In this work, we study the learnability of quantum circuits in the near term. We demonstrate the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes, motivating their use as a theoretical tool for near-term learning problems. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting, and show that such circuits can be learned in our setting with only a linear overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case quantum statistical query lower bounds for learning, within diamond distance, random quantum circuits with depth at least logarithmic and at most linear in the system size. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher using existing learning algorithms. To show the correctness of our distinguisher, we prove a new variation of the quantum no free lunch theorem.

<title>Building a stable classifier with the inflated argmax</title>

Abstract: We propose a new framework for algorithmic stability in the context of multiclass classification. In practice, classification algorithms often operate by first assigning a continuous score (for instance, an estimated probability) to each possible label, then taking the maximizer -- i.e., selecting the class that has the highest score. A drawback of this type of approach is that it is inherently unstable, meaning that it is very sensitive to slight perturbations of the training data, since taking the maximizer is discontinuous. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a pipeline for constructing stable classifiers from data, using bagging (i.e., resampling and averaging) to produce stable continuous scores, and then using a stable relaxation of argmax, which we call the "inflated argmax," to convert these scores to a set of candidate labels. The resulting stability guarantee places no distributional assumptions on the data, does not depend on the number of classes or dimensionality of the covariates, and holds for any base classifier. Using a common benchmark data set, we demonstrate that the inflated argmax provides necessary protection against unstable classifiers, without loss of accuracy.

arXiv:2405.18176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic approach for generating prediction intervals with any ML model. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, leveraging latent variable modeling for uncertainty estimation. Through extensive empirical evaluation of diverse simulated distributions and 11 real-world tabular datasets, SEMF consistently produces narrower prediction intervals while maintaining the desired coverage probability, outperforming traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, without using the quantile (pinball) loss, SEMF allows point predictors, including gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, to be calibrated with conformal quantile regression. The results indicate that SEMF enhances uncertainty quantification under diverse data distributions and is particularly effective for models that otherwise struggle with inherent uncertainty representation.

<title>ReDistill: Residual Encoded Distillation for Peak Memory Reduction of CNNs</title>

Abstract: The expansion of neural network sizes and the enhanced resolution of modern image sensors result in heightened memory and power demands to process modern computer vision models. In order to deploy these models in extremely resource-constrained edge devices, it is crucial to reduce their peak memory, which is the maximum memory consumed during the execution of a model. A naive approach to reducing peak memory is aggressive down-sampling of feature maps via pooling with large stride, which often results in unacceptable degradation in network performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose residual encoded distillation (ReDistill) for peak memory reduction in a teacher-student framework, in which a student network with less memory is derived from the teacher network using aggressive pooling. We apply our distillation method to multiple problems in computer vision, including image classification and diffusion-based image generation. For image classification, our method yields 4x-5x theoretical peak memory reduction with less degradation in accuracy for most CNN-based architectures. For diffusion-based image generation, our proposed distillation method yields a denoising network with 4x lower theoretical peak memory while maintaining decent diversity and fidelity for image generation. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to other feature-based and response-based distillation methods when applied to the same student network. The code is available at https://github.com/mengtang-lab/ReDistill.

<title>Accessible, At-Home Detection of Parkinson's Disease via Multi-task Video Analysis</title>

Abstract: Limited accessibility to neurological care leads to underdiagnosed Parkinson's Disease (PD), preventing early intervention. Existing AI-based PD detection methods primarily focus on unimodal analysis of motor or speech tasks, overlooking the multifaceted nature of the disease. To address this, we introduce a large-scale, multi-task video dataset consisting of 1102 sessions (each containing videos of finger tapping, facial expression, and speech tasks captured via webcam) from 845 participants (272 with PD). We propose a novel Uncertainty-calibrated Fusion Network (UFNet) that leverages this multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy. UFNet employs independent task-specific networks, trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty quantification, followed by self-attended fusion of features, with attention weights dynamically adjusted based on task-specific uncertainties. To ensure patient-centered evaluation, the participants were randomly split into three sets: 60% for training, 20% for model selection, and 20% for final performance evaluation. UFNet significantly outperformed single-task models in terms of accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and sensitivity while maintaining non-inferior specificity. Withholding uncertain predictions further boosted the performance, achieving 88.0+-0.3%$ accuracy, 93.0+-0.2% AUROC, 79.3+-0.9% sensitivity, and 92.6+-0.3% specificity, at the expense of not being able to predict for 2.3+-0.3% data (+- denotes 95% confidence interval). Further analysis suggests that the trained model does not exhibit any detectable bias across sex and ethnic subgroups and is most effective for individuals aged between 50 and 80. Requiring only a webcam and microphone, our approach facilitates accessible home-based PD screening, especially in regions with limited healthcare resources.

<title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>

arXiv:2407.17214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.

<title>W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2408.08444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers, relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG, a method that draws weak training signals from the downstream task (such as OpenQA) of an LLM, and fine-tunes the retriever to prioritize passages that most benefit the task. Specifically, we rerank the top-$k$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that the LLM will generate the correct answer for a question given each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive fine-tuning examples for dense retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets to demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models, achieving results comparable to models fine-tuned with human-labeled data.

<title>Position: From Correlation to Causation: Max-Pooling-Based Multi-Instance Learning Leads to More Robust Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Although attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) algorithms have achieved impressive performance on slide-level whole slide image (WSI) classification tasks, they are prone to mistakenly focusing on irrelevant patterns such as staining conditions and tissue morphology, leading to incorrect patch-level predictions and unreliable interpretability. In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.

<title>Adaptive Sample Aggregation In Transfer Learning</title>

arXiv:2408.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer Learning aims to optimally aggregate samples from a target distribution, with related samples from a so-called source distribution to improve target risk. Multiple procedures have been proposed over the last two decades to address this problem, each driven by one of a multitude of possible divergence measures between source and target distributions. A first question asked in this work is whether there exist unified algorithmic approaches that automatically adapt to many of these divergence measures simultaneously.
  We show that this is indeed the case for a large family of divergences proposed across classification and regression tasks, as they all happen to upper-bound the same measure of continuity between source and target risks, which we refer to as a weak modulus of transfer. This more unified view allows us, first, to identify algorithmic approaches that are simultaneously adaptive to these various divergence measures via a reduction to particular confidence sets. Second, it allows for a more refined understanding of the statistical limits of transfer under such divergences, and in particular, reveals regimes with faster rates than might be expected under coarser lenses.
  We then turn to situations that are not well captured by the weak modulus and corresponding divergences: these are situations where the aggregate of source and target data can improve target performance significantly beyond what's possible with either source or target data alone. We show that common such situations -- as may arise, e.g., under certain causal models with spurious correlations -- are well described by a so-called strong modulus of transfer which supersedes the weak modulus. We finally show that the strong modulus also admits adaptive procedures, which achieve near optimal rates in terms of the unknown strong modulus, and therefore apply in more general settings.

Abstract: Generating diverse VLSI layout patterns is essential for various downstream tasks in design for manufacturing, as design rules continually evolve during the development of new technology nodes. However, existing training-based methods for layout pattern generation rely on large datasets. In practical scenarios, especially when developing a new technology node, obtaining such extensive layout data is challenging. Consequently, training models with large datasets becomes impractical, limiting the scalability and adaptability of prior approaches. To this end, we propose PatternPaint, a diffusion-based framework capable of generating legal patterns with limited design-rule-compliant training samples. PatternPaint simplifies complex layout pattern generation into a series of inpainting processes with a template-based denoising scheme. Furthermore, we perform few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results show that using a sub-3nm technology node (Intel 18A), our model is the only one that can generate legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings among all previous works and achieves a high diversity score. Additionally, our few-shot finetuning can boost the legality rate with 1.87X improvement compared to the original pretrained model. As a result, we demonstrate a production-ready approach for layout pattern generation in developing new technology nodes.

Abstract: Online sellers and advertisers are recommended keyphrases for their listed products, which they bid on to enhance their sales. One popular paradigm that generates such recommendations is Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC), which involves tagging/mapping keyphrases to items. We outline the limitations of using traditional item-query based tagging or mapping techniques for keyphrase recommendations on E-Commerce platforms. We introduce GraphEx, an innovative graph-based approach that recommends keyphrases to sellers using extraction of token permutations from item titles. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying on traditional metrics such as precision/recall can be misleading in practical applications, thereby necessitating a combination of metrics to evaluate performance in real-world scenarios. These metrics are designed to assess the relevance of keyphrases to items and the potential for buyer outreach. GraphEx outperforms production models at eBay, achieving the objectives mentioned above. It supports near real-time inferencing in resource-constrained production environments and scales effectively for billions of items.

Abstract: Since the entry of kernel theory in the field of quantum machine learning, quantum kernel methods (QKMs) have gained increasing attention with regard to both probing promising applications and delivering intriguing research insights. Benchmarking these methods is crucial to gain robust insights and to understand their practical utility. In this work, we present a comprehensive large-scale study examining QKMs based on fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) across a manifold of design choices. Our investigation encompasses both classification and regression tasks for five dataset families and 64 datasets, systematically comparing the use of FQKs and PQKs quantum support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This resulted in over 20,000 models that were trained and optimized using a state-of-the-art hyperparameter search to ensure robust and comprehensive insights. We delve into the importance of hyperparameters on model performance scores and support our findings through rigorous correlation analyses. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis addressing the design freedom of PQKs and explore the underlying principles responsible for learning. Our goal is not to identify the best-performing model for a specific task but to uncover the mechanisms that lead to effective QKMs and reveal universal patterns.

Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.

Abstract: Developing dedicated mixed-signal neuromorphic computing systems optimized for real-time sensory-processing in extreme edge-computing applications requires time-consuming design, fabrication, and deployment of full-custom neuromorphic processors. To ensure that initial prototyping efforts, exploring the properties of different network architectures and parameter settings, lead to realistic results, it is important to use simulation frameworks that match as best as possible the properties of the final hardware. This is particularly challenging for neuromorphic hardware platforms made using mixed-signal analog/digital circuits, due to the variability and noise sensitivity of their components. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a software spiking neural network simulator explicitly designed to account for the properties of mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits, including device mismatch variability.
  The simulator, called ARCANA (A Realistic Simulation Framework for Analog/Digital Neuromorphic Architectures), is designed to reproduce the dynamics of mixed-signal synapse and neuron electronic circuits with autogradient differentiation for parameter optimization and GPU acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by matching software simulation results with measurements made from an existing neuromorphic processor. We show how the results obtained provide a reliable estimate of the behavior of the spiking neural network trained in software, once deployed in hardware. This framework enables the development and innovation of new learning rules and processing architectures in neuromorphic embedded systems.

Abstract: Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art neural audio compression models have progressively adopted residual vector quantization (RVQ). Despite this success, these models employ a fixed number of codebooks per frame, which can be suboptimal in terms of rate-distortion tradeoff, particularly in scenarios with simple input audio, such as silence. To address this limitation, we propose variable bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) for audio codecs, which allows for more efficient coding by adapting the number of codebooks used per frame. Furthermore, we propose a gradient estimation method for the non-differentiable masking operation that transforms from the importance map to the binary importance mask, improving model training via a straight-through estimator. We demonstrate that the proposed training framework achieves superior results compared to the baseline method and shows further improvement when applied to the current state-of-the-art codec.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding text and images. We study the processing of visual tokens in the language model component of LLaVA, a prominent VLM. Our approach focuses on analyzing the localization of object information, the evolution of visual token representations across layers, and the mechanism of integrating visual information for predictions. Through ablation studies, we demonstrated that object identification accuracy drops by over 70\% when object-specific tokens are removed. We observed that visual token representations become increasingly interpretable in the vocabulary space across layers, suggesting an alignment with textual tokens corresponding to image content. Finally, we found that the model extracts object information from these refined representations at the last token position for prediction, mirroring the process in text-only language models for factual association tasks. These findings provide crucial insights into how VLMs process and integrate visual information, bridging the gap between our understanding of language and vision models, and paving the way for more interpretable and controllable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Despite the impressive text-to-image (T2I) synthesis capabilities of diffusion models, they often struggle to understand compositional relationships between objects and attributes, especially in complex settings. Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.

Abstract: One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) restricts communication between the server and clients to a single round, significantly reducing communication costs and minimizing privacy leakage risks compared to traditional Federated Learning (FL), which requires multiple rounds of communication. However, existing OSFL frameworks remain vulnerable to distributional heterogeneity, as they primarily focus on model heterogeneity while neglecting data heterogeneity. To bridge this gap, we propose FedHydra, a unified, data-free, OSFL framework designed to effectively address both model and data heterogeneity. Unlike existing OSFL approaches, FedHydra introduces a novel two-stage learning mechanism. Specifically, it incorporates model stratification and heterogeneity-aware stratified aggregation to mitigate the challenges posed by both model and data heterogeneity. By this design, the data and model heterogeneity issues are simultaneously monitored from different aspects during learning. Consequently, FedHydra can effectively mitigate both issues by minimizing their inherent conflicts. We compared FedHydra with five SOTA baselines on four benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous OSFL methods in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Fed-SA-A4D7.

Abstract: This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored to the unsupervised classification of short text data. While the Multinomial probability vector is traditionally assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution, this work explores an alternative formulation based on the Beta-Liouville distribution, which offers a more flexible correlation structure than the Dirichlet. We examine the theoretical properties of the Beta-Liouville distribution, with particular focus on its conjugacy with the Multinomial likelihood. This property enables the derivation of update equations for a CAVI (Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference) algorithm, facilitating approximate posterior inference of the model parameters. In addition, we introduce a stochastic variant of the CAVI algorithm to enhance scalability. The paper concludes with empirical examples demonstrating effective strategies for selecting the Beta-Liouville hyperparameters.

Abstract: Large-scale distributed model training requires simultaneous training on up to thousands of machines. Faulty machine detection is critical when an unexpected fault occurs in a machine. From our experience, a training task can encounter two faults per day on average, possibly leading to a halt for hours. To address the drawbacks of the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual scrutiny, we propose Minder, an automatic faulty machine detector for distributed training tasks. The key idea of Minder is to automatically and efficiently detect faulty distinctive monitoring metric patterns, which could last for a period before the entire training task comes to a halt. Minder has been deployed in our production environment for over one year, monitoring daily distributed training tasks where each involves up to thousands of machines. In our real-world fault detection scenarios, Minder can accurately and efficiently react to faults within 3.6 seconds on average, with a precision of 0.904 and F1-score of 0.893.

<title>Causal-discovery-based root-cause analysis and its application in time-series prediction error diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Recent rapid advancements of machine learning have greatly enhanced the accuracy of prediction models, but most models remain "black boxes", making prediction error diagnosis challenging, especially with outliers. This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive experiments show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods.

Abstract: Human-annotated content is often used to train machine learning (ML) models. However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study explores the similarity between human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images across diverse socio-economic contexts (RQ1) and their impact on ML model performance and bias (RQ2). We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels, covering various daily activities and home environments. ML captions and human labels show highest similarity at a low-level, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but all annotations are consistent in how they perceive images across regions. ML Captions resulted in best overall region classification performance, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best overall for income regression. ML annotations worked best for action categories, while human input was more effective for non-action categories. These findings highlight the notion that both human and machine annotations are important, and that human-generated annotations are yet to be replaceable.

<title>Reactive Orchestration for Hierarchical Federated Learning Under a Communication Cost Budget</title>

Abstract: Deploying a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) pipeline across the computing continuum (CC) requires careful organization of participants into a hierarchical structure with intermediate aggregation nodes between FL clients and the global FL server. This is challenging to achieve due to (i) cost constraints, (ii) varying data distributions, and (iii) the volatile operating environment of the CC. In response to these challenges, we present a framework for the adaptive orchestration of HFL pipelines, designed to be reactive to client churn and infrastructure-level events, while balancing communication cost and ML model accuracy. Our mechanisms identify and react to events that cause HFL reconfiguration actions at runtime, building on multi-level monitoring information (model accuracy, resource availability, resource cost). Moreover, our framework introduces a generic methodology for estimating reconfiguration costs to continuously re-evaluate the quality of adaptation actions, while being extensible to optimize for various HFL performance criteria. By extending the Kubernetes ecosystem, our framework demonstrates the ability to react promptly and effectively to changes in the operating environment, making the best of the available communication cost budget and effectively balancing costs and ML performance at runtime.

<title>Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653</link>

Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.

<title>GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08661</link>

Abstract: Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Large-scale ML training jobs are frequently interrupted by hardware and software anomalies, failures, and management events. Existing solutions like checkpointing or runtime reconfiguration suffer from long downtimes, degraded performance, or undesired changes to training strategies. We present TrainMover, a resilient runtime that leverages standby machines to handle interruptions with minimal downtime and zero memory overhead. To achieve these goals, TrainMover introduces two key techniques: two-phase, delta-based communication group setups and communication-free sandboxed shadow iterations. Our evaluation shows that TrainMover consistently achieves second-level downtime across all evaluated models during migration, maintaining 99\% training efficiency during periodic 10-minute rebalancing. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of TrainMover in handling various interruptions.

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical study of a vulnerability detection and fix tool with professional software developers on real projects that they own. We implemented DeepVulGuard, an IDE-integrated tool based on state-of-the-art detection and fix models, and show that it has promising performance on benchmarks of historic vulnerability data. DeepVulGuard scans code for vulnerabilities (including identifying the vulnerability type and vulnerable region of code), suggests fixes, provides natural-language explanations for alerts and fixes, leveraging chat interfaces. We recruited 17 professional software developers at Microsoft, observed their usage of the tool on their code, and conducted interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, speed, trust, relevance, and workflow integration. We also gathered detailed qualitative feedback on users' perceptions and their desired features. Study participants scanned a total of 24 projects, 6.9k files, and over 1.7 million lines of source code, and generated 170 alerts and 50 fix suggestions. We find that although state-of-the-art AI-powered detection and fix tools show promise, they are not yet practical for real-world use due to a high rate of false positives and non-applicable fixes. User feedback reveals several actionable pain points, ranging from incomplete context to lack of customization for the user's codebase. Additionally, we explore how AI features, including confidence scores, explanations, and chat interaction, can apply to vulnerability detection and fixing. Based on these insights, we offer practical recommendations for evaluating and deploying AI detection and fix models. Our code and data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26367139.

Abstract: Gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms are increasingly used in actuarial applications as they show superior predictive performance over traditional generalised linear models. Many enhancements to the first gradient boosting machine algorithm exist. We present in a unified notation, and contrast, all the existing point and probabilistic gradient boosting for decision tree algorithms: GBM, XGBoost, DART, LightGBM, CatBoost, EGBM, PGBM, XGBoostLSS, cyclic GBM, and NGBoost. In this comprehensive numerical study, we compare their performance on five publicly available datasets for claim frequency and severity, of various sizes and comprising different numbers of (high cardinality) categorical variables. We explain how varying exposure-to-risk can be handled with boosting in frequency models. We compare the algorithms on the basis of computational efficiency, predictive performance, and model adequacy. LightGBM and XGBoostLSS win in terms of computational efficiency. CatBoost sometimes improves predictive performance, especially in the presence of high cardinality categorical variables, common in actuarial science. The fully interpretable EGBM achieves competitive predictive performance compared to the black box algorithms considered. We find that there is no trade-off between model adequacy and predictive accuracy: both are achievable simultaneously.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets.

Abstract: While modern visual recognition systems have made significant advancements, many continue to struggle with the open problem of learning from few exemplars. This paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object classes follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for long-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the low-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled database has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and scalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to collect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is straightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1) pre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail classes; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes. Our approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm without the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as was required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images, without extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised settings.

<title>Automatic Double Reinforcement Learning in Semiparametric Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference</title>

arXiv:2501.06926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects from short-term data is essential for decision-making in healthcare, economics, and industry, where long-term follow-up is often infeasible. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a principled framework for modeling outcomes as sequences of states, actions, and rewards over time. We introduce a semiparametric extension of Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for statistically efficient, model-robust inference on linear functionals of the Q-function, such as policy values, in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing semiparametric structure on the Q-function, our method relaxes the strong state overlap assumptions required by fully nonparametric approaches, improving efficiency and stability. To address computational and robustness challenges of minimax nuisance estimation, we develop a novel debiased plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which integrates fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression step. This procedure leverages the Q-function as a data-driven dimension reduction, debiases all linear functionals of interest simultaneously, and enables nonparametric inference without explicit nuisance function estimation. Bellman calibration generalizes isotonic calibration to MDPs and may be of independent interest for prediction in reinforcement learning. Finally, we show that model selection for the Q-function incurs only second-order bias and extend the adaptive debiased machine learning (ADML) framework to MDPs for data-driven learning of semiparametric structure.

Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.

Abstract: Plug-and-play approaches to solving inverse problems such as restoration and super-resolution have recently benefited from Diffusion-based generative priors for natural as well as medical images. However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.

Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.

Abstract: Enabling legged robots to perform non-prehensile loco-manipulation is crucial for enhancing their versatility. Learning behaviors such as whole-body object pushing often requires sophisticated planning strategies or extensive task-specific reward shaping, especially in unstructured environments. In this work, we present CAIMAN, a practical reinforcement learning framework that encourages the agent to gain control over other entities in the environment. CAIMAN leverages causal action influence as an intrinsic motivation objective, allowing legged robots to efficiently acquire object pushing skills even under sparse task rewards. We employ a hierarchical control strategy, combining a low-level locomotion module with a high-level policy that generates task-relevant velocity commands and is trained to maximize the intrinsic reward. To estimate causal action influence, we learn the dynamics of the environment by integrating a kinematic prior with data collected during training.We empirically demonstrate CAIMAN's superior sample efficiency and adaptability to diverse scenarios in simulation, as well as its successful transfer to real-world systems without further fine-tuning.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality. Our code is open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/svg-project/Sparse-VideoGen

<title>Brain Tumor Identification using Improved YOLOv8</title>

Abstract: Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.

<title>A Meta-learner for Heterogeneous Effects in Difference-in-Differences</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04699</link>

arXiv:2502.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data, adopting the popular Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework under the conditional parallel trends assumption. We propose a novel doubly robust meta-learner for the Conditional Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (CATT), reducing the estimation to a convex risk minimization problem involving a set of auxiliary models. Our framework allows for the flexible estimation of the CATT, when conditioning on any subset of variables of interest using generic machine learning. Leveraging Neyman orthogonality, our proposed approach is robust to estimation errors in the auxiliary models. As a generalization to our main result, we develop a meta-learning approach for the estimation of general conditional functionals under covariate shift. We also provide an extension to the instrumented DiD setting with non-compliance. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines.

<title>On the Difficulty of Constructing a Robust and Publicly-Detectable Watermark</title>

Abstract: This work investigates the theoretical boundaries of creating publicly-detectable schemes to enable the provenance of watermarked imagery. Metadata-based approaches like C2PA provide unforgeability and public-detectability. ML techniques offer robust retrieval and watermarking. However, no existing scheme combines robustness, unforgeability, and public-detectability. In this work, we formally define such a scheme and establish its existence. Although theoretically possible, we find that at present, it is intractable to build certain components of our scheme without a leap in deep learning capabilities. We analyze these limitations and propose research directions that need to be addressed before we can practically realize robust and publicly-verifiable provenance.

<title>One-Shot Learning for k-SAT</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.07135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a $k$-SAT formula $\Phi$ where every variable appears at most $d$ times, and let $\sigma$ be a satisfying assignment of $\Phi$ sampled proportionally to $e^{\beta m(\sigma)}$ where $m(\sigma)$ is the number of variables set to true and $\beta$ is a real parameter. Given $\Phi$ and $\sigma$, can we learn the value of $\beta$ efficiently?
  This problem falls into a recent line of works about single-sample ("one-shot") learning of Markov random fields. The $k$-SAT setting we consider here was recently studied by Galanis, Kandiros, and Kalavasis (SODA'24) where they showed that single-sample learning is possible when roughly $d\leq 2^{k/6.45}$ and impossible when $d\geq (k+1) 2^{k-1}$. Crucially, for their impossibility results they used the existence of unsatisfiable instances which, aside from the gap in $d$, left open the question of whether the feasibility threshold for one-shot learning is dictated by the satisfiability threshold of $k$-SAT formulas of bounded degree.
  Our main contribution is to answer this question negatively. We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction. On the positive side, we simplify the analysis of the learning algorithm and obtain significantly stronger bounds on $d$ in terms of $\beta$. In particular, for the uniform case $\beta\rightarrow 0$ that has been studied extensively in the sampling literature, our analysis shows that learning is possible under the condition $d\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. This is nearly optimal (up to constant factors) in the sense that it is known that sampling a uniformly-distributed satisfying assignment is NP-hard for $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$.

Abstract: In this study, we tackle industry challenges in video content classification by exploring and optimizing GPT-based models for zero-shot classification across seven critical categories of video quality. We contribute a novel approach to improving GPT's performance through prompt optimization and policy refinement, demonstrating that simplifying complex policies significantly reduces false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods. These experiments, conducted on real industry problems, show that thoughtful prompt design can substantially enhance GPT's performance without additional finetuning, offering an effective and scalable solution for improving video classification.

Abstract: Traversing risky terrains with sparse footholds poses a significant challenge for humanoid robots, requiring precise foot placements and stable locomotion. Existing learning-based approaches often struggle on such complex terrains due to sparse foothold rewards and inefficient learning processes. To address these challenges, we introduce BeamDojo, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for enabling agile humanoid locomotion on sparse footholds. BeamDojo begins by introducing a sampling-based foothold reward tailored for polygonal feet, along with a double critic to balancing the learning process between dense locomotion rewards and sparse foothold rewards. To encourage sufficient trial-and-error exploration, BeamDojo incorporates a two-stage RL approach: the first stage relaxes the terrain dynamics by training the humanoid on flat terrain while providing it with task-terrain perceptive observations, and the second stage fine-tunes the policy on the actual task terrain. Moreover, we implement a onboard LiDAR-based elevation map to enable real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that BeamDojo achieves efficient learning in simulation and enables agile locomotion with precise foot placement on sparse footholds in the real world, maintaining a high success rate even under significant external disturbances.

Abstract: When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

arXiv:2502.12063v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.

arXiv:2502.12152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic fall recovery is a crucial prerequisite before humanoid robots can be reliably deployed. Hand-designing controllers for getting up is difficult because of the varied configurations a humanoid can end up in after a fall and the challenging terrains humanoid robots are expected to operate on. This paper develops a learning framework to produce controllers that enable humanoid robots to get up from varying configurations on varying terrains. Unlike previous successful applications of learning to humanoid locomotion, the getting-up task involves complex contact patterns (which necessitates accurately modeling of the collision geometry) and sparser rewards. We address these challenges through a two-phase approach that induces a curriculum. The first stage focuses on discovering a good getting-up trajectory under minimal constraints on smoothness or speed / torque limits. The second stage then refines the discovered motions into deployable (i.e. smooth and slow) motions that are robust to variations in initial configuration and terrains. We find these innovations enable a real-world G1 humanoid robot to get up from two main situations that we considered: a) lying face up and b) lying face down, both tested on flat, deformable, slippery surfaces and slopes (e.g., sloppy grass and snowfield). This is one of the first successful demonstrations of learned getting-up policies for human-sized humanoid robots in the real world.

Abstract: Large language models excel at following explicit instructions, but they often struggle with ambiguous or incomplete user requests, defaulting to verbose, generic responses instead of seeking clarification. We introduce InfoQuest, a multi-turn chat benchmark designed to evaluate how dialogue agents handle hidden context in open-ended user requests. This benchmark presents intentionally ambiguous scenarios that require models to engage in information-seeking dialogue by asking clarifying questions before providing appropriate responses. Our evaluation of both open and closed models reveals that, while proprietary models generally perform better, all current assistants struggle to gather critical information effectively. They often require multiple turns to infer user intent and frequently default to generic responses without proper clarification. We provide a systematic methodology for generating diverse scenarios and evaluating models' information-seeking capabilities, which can be leveraged to automatically generate data for self-improvement. We also offer insights into the current limitations of language models in handling ambiguous requests through multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the properties of inorganic materials is crucial for accelerating advancements in materials science and driving applications in energy, electronics, and beyond. Integrating material structure data with language-based information through multi-modal large language models (LLMs) offers great potential to support these efforts by enhancing human-AI interaction. However, a key challenge lies in integrating atomic structures at full resolution into LLMs. In this work, we introduce MatterChat, a versatile structure-aware multi-modal LLM that unifies material structural data and textual inputs into a single cohesive model. MatterChat employs a bridging module to effectively align a pretrained machine learning interatomic potential with a pretrained LLM, reducing training costs and enhancing flexibility. Our results demonstrate that MatterChat significantly improves performance in material property prediction and human-AI interaction, surpassing general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4. We also demonstrate its usefulness in applications such as more advanced scientific reasoning and step-by-step material synthesis.

<title>Low degree conjecture implies sharp computational thresholds in stochastic block model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15024</link>

arXiv:2502.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate implications of the (extended) low-degree conjecture (recently formalized in [MW23]) in the context of the symmetric stochastic block model. Assuming the conjecture holds, we establish that no polynomial-time algorithm can weakly recover community labels below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. In particular, we rule out polynomial-time estimators that, with constant probability, achieve correlation with the true communities that is significantly better than random. Whereas, above the KS threshold, polynomial-time algorithms are known to achieve constant correlation with the true communities with high probability[Mas14,AS15].
  To our knowledge, we provide the first rigorous evidence for the sharp transition in recovery rate for polynomial-time algorithms at the KS threshold. Notably, under a stronger version of the low-degree conjecture, our lower bound remains valid even when the number of blocks diverges. Furthermore, our results provide evidence of a computational-to-statistical gap in learning the parameters of stochastic block models.
  In contrast to prior work, which either (i) rules out polynomial-time algorithms for hypothesis testing with 1-o(1) success probability [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] under the low-degree conjecture, or (ii) rules out low-degree polynomials for learning the edge connection probability matrix [LG23], our approach provides stronger lower bounds on the recovery and learning problem.
  Our proof combines low-degree lower bounds from [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] with graph splitting and cross-validation techniques. In order to rule out general recovery algorithms, we employ the correlation preserving projection method developed in [HS17].

Abstract: The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and performance metrics, demonstrating a 10% improvement in user satisfaction and a 5\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.

Abstract: Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging.
  We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors.
  Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer models to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.

Abstract: Home-based single-lead AI-ECG devices have enabled continuous, real-world cardiac monitoring. However, the accuracy of parameter calculations from single-lead AI-ECG algorithm remains to be fully validated, which is critical for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block (AVBI). In this multicenter study, we assessed FeatureDB, an ECG measurements computation algorithm, in the context of single-lead monitoring using three annotated datasets: PTB-XL+ (n=21,354), CSE (n=105), and HeartVoice-ECG-lite (n=369). FeatureDB showed strong correlation with standard ECG machines (12SL and Uni-G) in key measurements (PR, QRS, QT, QTc), and high agreement confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. In detecting LQTS (AUC=0.786) and AVBI (AUC=0.684), FeatureDB demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to commercial ECG systems (12SL: 0.859/0.716; Uni-G: 0.817/0.605), significantly outperforming ECGDeli (0.501/0.569). Notably, FeatureDB can operate locally on resource-limited devices, facilitating use in low-connectivity settings. These findings confirm the clinical reliability of FeatureDB for single-lead ECG diagnostics and highlight its potential to bridge traditional ECG diagnostics with wearable technology for scalable cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention.

<title>Evaluating Membership Inference Attacks in heterogeneous-data setups</title>

arXiv:2502.18986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among all privacy attacks against Machine Learning (ML), membership inference attacks (MIA) attracted the most attention. In these attacks, the attacker is given an ML model and a data point, and they must infer whether the data point was used for training. The attacker also has an auxiliary dataset to tune their inference algorithm.
  Attack papers commonly simulate setups in which the attacker's and the target's datasets are sampled from the same distribution. This setting is convenient to perform experiments, but it rarely holds in practice. ML literature commonly starts with similar simplifying assumptions (i.e., "i.i.d." datasets), and later generalizes the results to support heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, our work makes a first step in the generalization of the MIA evaluation to heterogeneous data.
  First, we design a metric to measure the heterogeneity between any pair of tabular data distributions. This metric provides a continuous scale to analyze the phenomenon. Second, we compare two methodologies to simulate a data heterogeneity between the target and the attacker. These setups provide opposite performances: 90% attack accuracy vs. 50% (i.e., random guessing). Our results show that the MIA accuracy depends on the experimental setup; and even if research on MIA considers heterogeneous data setups, we have no standardized baseline of how to simulate it. The lack of such a baseline for MIA experiments poses a significant challenge to risk assessments in real-world machine learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action models (VLAs) build upon pretrained vision-language models and leverage diverse robot datasets to demonstrate strong task execution, language following ability, and semantic generalization. Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate. We release code for OFT and pretrained model checkpoints at https://openvla-oft.github.io/.

Abstract: Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for overall health, yet many individuals struggle with meal planning due to nutritional complexity, time constraints, and lack of dietary knowledge. Personalized food recommendations can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve the lowest percentage errors of 1.55\% and 3.68\%, respectively, producing meal plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing deviation and improving precision.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders impacting the heart and circulatory system. These disorders are the foremost and continuously escalating cause of mortality worldwide. One of the main tasks when working with CVDs is analyzing and identifying pathologies on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a standard 10-second duration. Using machine learning (ML) in automatic ECG analysis increases CVD diagnostics' availability, speed, and accuracy. However, the most significant difficulty in developing ML models is obtaining a sufficient training dataset. Due to the limitations of medical data usage, such as expensiveness, errors, the ambiguity of labels, imbalance of classes, and privacy issues, utilizing synthetic samples depending on specific pathologies bypasses these restrictions and improves algorithm quality. Existing solutions for the conditional generation of ECG signals are mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and only a few papers consider the architectures based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), showing comparable results in recent works. This paper proposes the publicly available conditional Nouveau VAE model for ECG signal generation (cNVAE-ECG), which produces high-resolution ECGs with multiple pathologies. We provide an extensive comparison of the proposed model on various practical downstream tasks, including transfer learning scenarios showing an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) increase up to 2% surpassing GAN-like competitors.

Abstract: Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at https://github.com/thinkxca/rul.

Abstract: The transition to microservices has revolutionized software architectures, offering enhanced scalability and modularity. However, the distributed and dynamic nature of microservices introduces complexities in ensuring system reliability, making anomaly detection crucial for maintaining performance and functionality. Anomalies stemming from network and performance issues must be swiftly identified and addressed. Existing anomaly detection techniques often rely on statistical models or machine learning methods that struggle with the high-dimensional, interdependent data inherent in microservice applications. Current techniques and available datasets predominantly focus on system traces and logs, limiting their ability to support advanced detection models. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing the RS-Anomic dataset generated using the open-source RobotShop microservice application. The dataset captures multivariate performance metrics and response times under normal and anomalous conditions, encompassing ten types of anomalies. We propose a novel anomaly detection model called Graph Attention and LSTM-based Microservice Anomaly Detection (GAL-MAD), leveraging Graph Attention and Long Short-Term Memory architectures to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in microservices. We utilize SHAP values to localize anomalous services and identify root causes to enhance explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that GAL-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on the RS-Anomic dataset, achieving higher accuracy and recall across varying anomaly rates. The explanations provide actionable insights into service anomalies, which benefits system administrators.

Abstract: To address the challenge of insufficient interactivity and behavioral diversity in autonomous driving decision-making, this paper proposes a Cognitive Hierarchical Agent for Reasoning and Motion Stylization (CHARMS). By leveraging Level-k game theory, CHARMS captures human-like reasoning patterns through a two-stage training pipeline comprising reinforcement learning pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This enables the resulting models to exhibit diverse and human-like behaviors, enhancing their decision-making capacity and interaction fidelity in complex traffic environments. Building upon this capability, we further develop a scenario generation framework that utilizes the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory to control the distribution of vehicles with different driving styles through Poisson and binomial sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS is capable of both making intelligent driving decisions as an ego vehicle and generating diverse, realistic driving scenarios as environment vehicles. The code for CHARMS is released at https://github.com/chuduanfeng/CHARMS.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to progressive cognitive decline, making early detection crucial for effective intervention. While deep learning models have shown high accuracy in AD diagnosis, their lack of interpretability limits clinical trust and adoption. This paper introduces a novel pre-model approach leveraging Jacobian Maps (JMs) within a multi-modal framework to enhance explainability and trustworthiness in AD detection. By capturing localized brain volume changes, JMs establish meaningful correlations between model predictions and well-known neuroanatomical biomarkers of AD. We validate JMs through experiments comparing a 3D CNN trained on JMs versus on traditional preprocessed data, which demonstrates superior accuracy. We also employ 3D Grad-CAM analysis to provide both visual and quantitative insights, further showcasing improved interpretability and diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: One of the key missions of sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks is to deploy large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge to provide remote-inference services for edge devices. The resultant platform, known as edge inference, will support a wide range of Internet-of-Things applications, such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and augmented reality. Given the mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential to design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which primarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage probability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of E2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the inference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the E2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency constraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between communication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference reliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to optimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut probability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the received discriminant gain. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over conventional communication-centric approaches in terms of E2E inference reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been shown to improve the performance of large language models. However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively. Excitingly, the approach exhibits generalization across tasks: for example, training only on HotPotQA (text question-answering) improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K (a math dataset) by a relative 16.9%.

Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.

<div> reinforcement learning, autonomous driving, reward design, scalability, PPO

Summary:
Reinforcement learning is investigated for privileged planning in autonomous driving. Traditional rule-based methods are limited in scalability, prompting the use of reinforcement learning. The study reveals that the popular reward structure used in driving tasks fails to optimize with increased mini-batch sizes when using PPO. A new reward design focused on route completion is proposed, leading to improved scalability and performance with PPO. Training with large mini-batch sizes allows for efficient scaling through distributed data parallelism. The model trained with the new reward achieves impressive results, outperforming other RL methods in both CARLA and nuPlan benchmarks. The method shows significant success in nuPlan, scoring high in both non-reactive and reactive traffic scenarios while maintaining faster training times compared to previous approaches. Overall, the approach demonstrates the effectiveness of using simple reward structures in reinforcement learning for autonomous driving. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.

We use these measures as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces, disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low level API.

Abstract: Epilepsy, affecting approximately 50 million people globally, is characterized by abnormal brain activity and remains challenging to treat. The diagnosis of epilepsy relies heavily on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, where specialists manually analyze epileptiform patterns across pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and interictal periods. However, the manual analysis of EEG signals is prone to variability between experts, emphasizing the need for automated solutions. Although previous studies have explored preprocessing techniques and machine learning approaches for seizure detection, there is a gap in understanding how the representation of EEG data (time, frequency, or time-frequency domains) impacts the predictive performance of deep learning models. This work addresses this gap by systematically comparing deep neural networks trained on EEG data in these three domains. Through the use of statistical tests, we identify the optimal data representation and model architecture for epileptic seizure detection. The results demonstrate that frequency-domain data achieves detection metrics exceeding 97\%, providing a robust foundation for more accurate and reliable seizure detection systems.

arXiv:2504.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. Despite recent advancements and the success of different architectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of the real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal changes in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous studies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting, limiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity and resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive Network (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is the Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the Style Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and Belongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates non-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by blending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization while maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which dynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances predictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs multi-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce noise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's efficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE.

<br />
Summary:<br />
In this paper, the authors investigate the response of concept-based models (CMs) to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are neural architectures that predict high-level concepts before task labels. A weakness identified in current CMs, leakage poisoning, hinders their accuracy improvement with concept interventions on OOD inputs. To address this, MixCEM is introduced, a model that dynamically utilizes missing leaked information only when it is in-distribution. Results show MixCEMs outperform strong baselines, improving accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples with and without concept interventions on tasks with and without complete concept annotations. The study highlights the importance of addressing leakage poisoning in CMs for better performance on OOD inputs and the effectiveness of MixCEM in overcoming this challenge. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence of concept interventions.

Summary: 
This paper delves into the limitations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) caused by their reliance on statistical correlations rather than causal reasoning, impacting their robustness and interpretability. The study proposes leveraging causal inference techniques, including causal debugging, counterfactual analysis, and structural causal models, to identify and rectify failures in DNNs. These approaches not only aid in repairing DNNs but also support fairness, adversarial robustness, and backdoor mitigation by offering targeted interventions. Despite the promising results, key challenges such as scalability, generalization, and computational efficiency need to be addressed. The researchers emphasize the importance of integrating causality-driven interventions to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the future.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often rely on statistical correlations rather than causal reasoning, limiting their robustness and interpretability. While testing methods can identify failures, effective debugging and repair remain challenging. This paper explores causal inference as an approach primarily for DNN repair, leveraging causal debugging, counterfactual analysis, and structural causal models (SCMs) to identify and correct failures. We discuss in what ways these techniques support fairness, adversarial robustness, and backdoor mitigation by providing targeted interventions. Finally, we discuss key challenges, including scalability, generalization, and computational efficiency, and outline future directions for integrating causality-driven interventions to enhance DNN reliability.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging subject in machine learning that aims to solve multiple tasks presented sequentially to the learner without forgetting previously learned tasks. Recently, many deep learning based approaches have been proposed for continual learning, however the mathematical foundations behind existing continual learning methods remain underdeveloped. On the other hand, adaptive filtering is a classic subject in signal processing with a rich history of mathematically principled methods. However, its role in understanding the foundations of continual learning has been underappreciated. In this tutorial, we review the basic principles behind both continual learning and adaptive filtering, and present a comparative analysis that highlights multiple connections between them. These connections allow us to enhance the mathematical foundations of continual learning based on existing results for adaptive filtering, extend adaptive filtering insights using existing continual learning methods, and discuss a few research directions for continual learning suggested by the historical developments in adaptive filtering.

Abstract: We present a dynamic self-balancing octree data structure that enables efficient neighborhood maintenance in evolving metric spaces, a key challenge in modern machine learning systems. Many learning and generative models operate as dynamical systems whose representations evolve during training, requiring fast, adaptive spatial organization. Our two-parameter octree supports logarithmic-time updates and queries, eliminating the need for costly full rebuilds as data distributions shift. We demonstrate its effectiveness in four areas: (1) accelerating Stein variational gradient descent by supporting more particles with lower overhead; (2) enabling real-time, incremental KNN classification with logarithmic complexity; (3) facilitating efficient, dynamic indexing and retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation; and (4) improving sample efficiency by jointly optimizing input and latent spaces. Across all applications, our approach yields exponential speedups while preserving accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where maintaining adaptive spatial structure is critical.

Summary:  
The article introduces the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT) framework for dynamic traffic modeling and assessment at intersections and corridors. It integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks to estimate Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization, such as queue length and travel time. TGDT outperforms existing models by producing accurate multi-output estimates efficiently, even in extreme traffic conditions, with minimal input features. The model is scalable, parallelized, and real-time, making it a cost-effective solution for traffic signal optimization. <div>

Abstract: Urban congestion at signalized intersections leads to significant delays, economic losses, and increased emissions. Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.

<br />
Concept Bottleneck Models aim to increase the reliability of AI systems by restricting their decisions to easily understandable concepts. However, these models are often hindered by inaccurate concept labels in datasets, leading to a notable decrease in performance. To tackle this issue, the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective is proposed, which is a novel loss function based on Direct Preference Optimization. The CPO objective effectively counteracts the negative impact of mislabeled concepts on Concept Bottleneck Model performance. It directly optimizes the concept's posterior distribution and is less sensitive to concept noise compared to Binary Cross Entropy. Empirical results demonstrate that the CPO objective consistently outperforms Binary Cross Entropy in real-world datasets, even when label noise is introduced. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human understandable concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contains accurate concept labels an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an analysis on some key properties of the CPO objective showing it directly optimizes for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) where we show CPO is inherently less sensitive to concept noise. We empirically confirm our analysis finding that CPO consistently outperforms BCE in three real world datasets with and without added label noise.

<div> Hilbert-space, tensor decompositions, sequence modelling, transformer networks, Local Learning Coefficient (LLC) estimates

Summary:
In this study, a geometric approach to sequence modelling in transformer networks is developed. The researchers utilize tensor decompositions in a Hilbert-space framework to identify principal modes of conditional sequence distributions. By truncating small-amplitude modes, an effective data distribution is obtained, retaining dominant structure while discarding statistical detail. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Local Learning Coefficient (LLC) estimates are robust to modes below a data-dependent threshold, characterizing the geometry of the effective distribution rather than the true one. This explains the reliability of LLC estimates even when network parameters do not strictly minimize population loss. Additionally, the study reveals how the inverse temperature in Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) serves as a resolution dial on the landscape structure. <div>

Abstract: We develop a geometric account of sequence modelling that links patterns in the data to measurable properties of the loss landscape in transformer networks. First, we cast conditional sequence distributions into a Hilbert-space framework and apply tensor decompositions to identify their principal modes. Truncating the small-amplitude modes yields an effective data distribution that preserves dominant structure while discarding statistical detail. Second, we show theoretically that Local Learning Coefficient (LLC) estimates are insensitive to modes below a data-dependent threshold. Consequently, the LLC calculated in practice characterises the geometry of the effective rather than the true distribution. This insight clarifies why reliable LLC estimates can be obtained even when a network parameter is not a strict minimiser of the population loss, and it highlights how the inverse temperature in SGLD acts as a resolution dial on the landscape structure.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of Weight Space Learning (WSL), which utilizes trained Neural Network (NN) models' weights as a data modality. It discusses the need for structured model zoos for WSL development and evaluation. By incorporating phase information from statistical physics, the authors create 12 large-scale zoos covering known phases and varying model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets span computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific ML, allowing for diverse applications. The authors analyze loss landscape metrics for each model, validating full coverage of phases. They highlight the importance of loss landscape phases in model training, analysis, and sparsification. An exploratory study showcases the impact of phase information on downstream methods like transfer learning and model weights averaging. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the community, enabling further exploration of WSL and its applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the weights of trained Neural Network (NN) models as data modality has recently gained traction as a research field - dubbed Weight Space Learning (WSL). Multiple recent works propose WSL methods to analyze models, evaluate methods, or synthesize weights. Weight space learning methods require populations of trained models as datasets for development and evaluation. However, existing collections of models - called `model zoos' - are unstructured or follow a rudimentary definition of diversity. In parallel, work rooted in statistical physics has identified phases and phase transitions in NN models. Models are homogeneous within the same phase but qualitatively differ from one phase to another. We combine the idea of `model zoos' with phase information to create a controlled notion of diversity in populations. We introduce 12 large-scale zoos that systematically cover known phases and vary over model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets cover different modalities, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific ML. For every model, we compute loss landscape metrics and validate full coverage of the phases. With this dataset, we provide the community with a resource with a wide range of potential applications for WSL and beyond. Evidence suggests the loss landscape phase plays a role in applications such as model training, analysis, or sparsification. We demonstrate this in an exploratory study of the downstream methods like transfer learning or model weights averaging.

<br />Summary: 
The article introduces a privacy-preserving distributed PV disaggregation framework utilizing Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) to address the challenges brought by the rapid increase in distributed PV installations. The framework incorporates a two-level approach, combining local and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based model is used to create solar irradiance embeddings, with an adaptive local aggregation mechanism to alleviate statistical heterogeneity effects. The global level involves a central server aggregating data from various centers for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing. Experiments on real-world data showcase the framework's enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods, highlighting the efficacy of the proposed approach in estimating PV generation accurately while maintaining privacy and addressing statistical heterogeneity. <div>
arXiv:2504.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide, many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark methods.

<div> randomization, GNN training, mini-batch construction, community structure, GPU caches
Summary:<br /><br />Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are commonly trained using mini-batch techniques for scalability and convergence improvement. However, existing methods often lead to irregular memory access patterns and suboptimal GPU cache utilization due to agnostic randomization schemes. Deterministic mini-batching based on graph structure sacrifices randomness for runtime efficiency, affecting model accuracy and convergence speed. This paper introduces Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel approach balancing randomness and graph awareness. COMM-RAND reduces GNN training time by up to 2.76x while maintaining accuracy within 1.79% points compared to random approaches. By exploring the space between randomness and structure, COMM-RAND significantly improves efficiency in GNN training across popular benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2504.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

Summary: <br />
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are effective in solving problems governed by partial differential equations but are limited by inaccurate treatment of boundary conditions. This paper introduces R-functions as distance functions to enforce boundary conditions accurately, even in non-convex domains. The method is extended to inverse problems using PINNs, with an adaptive weight tuning technique for efficient analysis. Numerical experiments show superior accuracy and efficiency compared to penalty-based methods, especially in complex geometries. This approach presents a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis in engineering applications. <div>
arXiv:2504.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have attracted significant attention in scientific machine learning for their capability to solve forward and inverse problems governed by partial differential equations. However, the accuracy of PINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions. Conventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as penalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the given boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty parameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically R-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these limitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate representation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and facilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance function-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using PINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and efficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method solves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based methods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries. This approach offers a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis using PINNs, with potential applications across a wide range of engineering problems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is beneficial to objectively determine whether a subject is meditating, most research in the literature reports good results only in a subject-dependent manner. This study aims to distinguish the modified state of consciousness experienced during Rajyoga meditation from the resting state of the brain in a subject-independent manner using EEG data. Three architectures have been proposed and evaluated: The CSP-LDA Architecture utilizes common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM Architecture employs CSP for feature extraction, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for classification, modeling the binary classification problem as a sequence learning problem. The SVD-NN Architecture uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant components of the EEG signals and a shallow neural network (NN) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM architecture gives the best performance with 98.2% accuracy for intra-subject classification. The SVD-NN architecture provides significant performance with 96.4\% accuracy for inter-subject classification. This is comparable to the best-reported accuracies in the literature for intra-subject classification. Both architectures are capable of capturing subject-invariant EEG features for effectively classifying the meditative state from the resting state. The high intra-subject and inter-subject classification accuracies indicate these systems' robustness and their ability to generalize across different subjects.

Abstract: The number of electrified powertrains is ever increasing today towards a more sustainable future; thus, it is essential that unwanted failures are prevented, and a reliable operation is secured. Monitoring the internal temperatures of motors and keeping them under their thresholds is an important first step. Conventional modeling methods require expert knowledge and complicated mathematical approaches. With all the data a modern electric drive collects nowadays during the system operation, it is feasible to apply data-driven approaches for estimating thermal behaviors. In this paper, multiple machine-learning methods are investigated on their capability to approximate the temperatures of the stator winding and bearing in induction motors. The explored algorithms vary from linear to neural networks. For this reason, experimental lab data have been captured from a powertrain under predetermined operating conditions. For each approach, a hyperparameter search is then performed to find the optimal configuration. All the models are evaluated by various metrics, and it has been found that neural networks perform satisfactorily even under transient conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for developing surrogate environments in reinforcement learning (RL) using the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments in OpenAI Gym environments, particularly Mountain Car and Lunar Lander. Our results show that SINDy-based surrogate models can accurately capture the underlying dynamics of these environments while reducing computational costs by 20-35%. With only 75 interactions for Mountain Car and 1000 for Lunar Lander, we achieve state-wise correlations exceeding 0.997, with mean squared errors as low as 3.11e-06 for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42e-06 for LunarLander position. RL agents trained in these surrogate environments require fewer total steps (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs. 1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) while achieving comparable performance to those trained in the original environments, exhibiting similar convergence patterns and final performance metrics. This work contributes to the field of model-based RL by providing an efficient method for generating accurate, interpretable surrogate environments.

Summary:
The study explores the enhancement of large language models (LLMs) for programming and mathematical reasoning tasks using synthetic data. It delves into factors such as model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and the number of fine-tuning rounds. The Think, Prune, Train process is introduced as a scalable framework that involves iteratively fine-tuning models on their reasoning traces with ground-truth pruning. Results show significant performance improvements, with Gemma2-2B achieving a Pass@1 of 57.6%, Gemma2-9B matching LLaMA-3.1-70B at 82%, and LLaMA-3.1-70B surpassing GPT-40 at 91%. This demonstrates the effectiveness of self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection in enhancing LLM capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in programming and mathematical reasoning tasks, but are constrained by limited high-quality training data. Synthetic data can be leveraged to enhance fine-tuning outcomes, but several factors influence this process, including model size, synthetic data volume, pruning strategy, and number of fine-tuning rounds. We explore these axes and investigate which conditions enable model self-improvement. We introduce the Think, Prune, Train process, a scalable framework that iteratively fine-tunes models on their own reasoning traces, using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6% (from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B attains 91%, even surpassing GPT-4o, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-generated reasoning and systematic data selection for improving LLM capabilities.

<div> framework, Score-Based Transport Modeling, sampling, unnormalized target density, deterministic

Summary:
Score-Based Transport Modeling (SBTM) is proposed for sampling unnormalized target densities without pre-training the score function. SBTM learns the time-varying score on the fly using score matching, approximating the Wasserstein gradient flow on KL divergence. The deterministic trajectories generated are smooth, interpretable, and noise-free, with the same distribution as Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same optimal rate as the exact gradient flow when adequately trained. The framework is extended to annealed dynamics for non log-concave targets. Numerical experiments confirm the optimal convergence rate, smooth trajectories, and compatibility with annealed dynamics, outperforming ULA and annealed ULA baselines. <div>
arXiv:2504.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based Transport Modeling (SBTM) for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$. While diffusion generative modeling relies on pre-training the score function $\nabla \log f_t$ using samples from $\pi$, SBTM addresses the more general and challenging setting where only $\nabla \log\pi$ is known. SBTM approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on KL$(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. The learned score gives immediate access to relative Fisher information, providing a built-in convergence diagnostic. The deterministic trajectories are smooth, interpretable, and free of Brownian-motion noise, while having the same distribution as ULA. We prove that SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. We further extend our framework to annealed dynamics, to handle non log-concave targets. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: SBTM converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is easily integrated with annealed dynamics. We compare to the baselines of ULA and annealed ULA.

<div> Keywords: Imbalanced datasets, Tree boosting methods, XGBoost, Detection performance, Hyper-parameter optimization

Summary: 
Imbalanced datasets present a challenge for machine learning algorithms in classification tasks. This paper evaluates the performance of tree boosting methods, specifically XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost, on datasets of varying sizes and class distributions. The study introduces a method for data preparation and hyper-parameter optimization for tree boosting algorithms. Results show that as training data increases, detection performance improves, but decreases as data distribution becomes more imbalanced. Balancing the training set through sampling does not consistently improve performance, while hyper-parameter optimization can enhance detection. The developed method exhibits robustness to data variations over time, with the option of retraining when performance declines. In risk assessment using machine learning, tree-based methods like XGBoost show promise for handling imbalanced datasets and achieving superior recognition performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions, from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated. After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance starts deteriorating.

Summary:
The study introduces the Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) to improve performance in graph contrastive learning (GCL). The framework addresses issues with prevalent GCL models, such as biased essential structures due to random noise perturbation in augmented views. It incorporates a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to capture global interactions accurately. Additionally, a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with adaptive reweighting distinguishes the importance of hard and easy sample pairs. Experiment results on benchmark datasets demonstrate CSG2L's superiority over existing methods. The framework is compatible with various Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), making it versatile and effective for complex structural learning from graphs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently since it learns complex structural information from graphs through self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely, they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.

<div> Keywords: Imitation Learning, Temporal Consistency, Controllability, Diverse Behaviors, Trajectory Generation

Summary: 
Imitation Learning (IL) techniques aim to replicate human behaviors in specific tasks by learning from expert datasets. Traditional IL methods focus on producing a single efficient policy from these datasets. Recent extensions have addressed the challenge of diverse behaviors by focusing on transition-level policies and trajectory-level entropy maximization. However, these approaches may not fully capture the diversity of demonstrations or allow for controlled trajectory generation. To address these limitations, a new method is proposed based on Temporal Consistency and Controllability. Temporal Consistency ensures consistent behaviors across entire episodes, not just at the transition level, while Controllability involves constructing a latent space of behaviors for selective activation based on user requirements. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are conducted across various tasks and environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This research aims to enhance the diversity and controllability of learned behaviors in imitation learning settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) techniques aim to replicate human behaviors in specific tasks. While IL has gained prominence due to its effectiveness and efficiency, traditional methods often focus on datasets collected from experts to produce a single efficient policy. Recently, extensions have been proposed to handle datasets of diverse behaviors by mainly focusing on learning transition-level diverse policies or on performing entropy maximization at the trajectory level. While these methods may lead to diverse behaviors, they may not be sufficient to reproduce the actual diversity of demonstrations or to allow controlled trajectory generation. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a different method based on two key features: a) Temporal Consistency that ensures consistent behaviors across entire episodes and not just at the transition level as well as b) Controllability obtained by constructing a latent space of behaviors that allows users to selectively activate specific behaviors based on their requirements. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods over a diverse set of tasks and environments. Project page: https://mathieu-petitbois.github.io/projects/swr/

Summary:
- The study aimed to objectively define regions of the North Atlantic using a data-driven machine learning approach.
- Various clustering methods were applied to generate and validate ocean clusters using salinity, temperature, and nutrient concentration data.
- The UMAP-DBSCAN method was found to best represent the data, resulting in a final set of 321 clusters.
- Reproducibility was ensured through ensemble overlap analysis and uncertainty estimation by NEMI.
- The clustering results aligned well with common water mass definitions and provided more detailed regionalization than previous concepts, such as Longhurst provinces.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining ocean regions and water masses helps to understand marine processes and can serve downstream-tasks such as defining marine protected areas. However, such definitions are often a result of subjective decisions potentially producing misleading, unreproducible results. Here, the aim was to objectively define regions of the North Atlantic. For this, a data-driven, systematic machine learning approach was applied to generate and validate ocean clusters employing external, internal and relative validation techniques. About 300 million measured salinity, temperature, and oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentration values served as input for various clustering methods (KMeans, agglomerative Ward, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) emphasised (dis-)similarities in the data while reducing dimensionality. Based on a systematic validation of the considered clustering methods and their hyperparameters, the results showed that UMAP-DBSCAN best represented the data. To address stochastic variability, 100 UMAP-DBSCAN clustering runs were conducted and aggregated using Native Emergent Manifold Interrogation (NEMI), producing a final set of 321 clusters. Reproducibility was evaluated by calculating the ensemble overlap (88.81 +- 1.8%) and the mean grid cell-wise uncertainty estimated by NEMI (15.49 +- 20%). The presented clustering results agreed very well with common water mass definitions. This study revealed a more detailed regionalization compared to previous concepts such as the Longhurst provinces. The applied method is objective, efficient and reproducible and will support future research focusing on biogeochemical differences and changes in oceanic regions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source and reproducible implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks for time series forecasting. We evaluated LSTM and GRU networks because of their performance reported in related work. We describe our method and its results on two datasets. The first dataset is the S&amp;P BSE BANKEX, composed of stock time series (closing prices) of ten financial institutions. The second dataset, called Activities, comprises ten synthetic time series resembling weekly activities with five days of high activity and two days of low activity. We report Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between actual and predicted values, as well as Directional Accuracy (DA). We show that a single time series from a dataset can be used to adequately train the networks if the sequences in the dataset contain patterns that repeat, even with certain variation, and are properly processed. For 1-step ahead and 20-step ahead forecasts, LSTM and GRU networks significantly outperform a baseline on the Activities dataset. The baseline simply repeats the last available value. On the stock market dataset, the networks perform just like the baseline, possibly due to the nature of these series. We release the datasets used as well as the implementation with all experiments performed to enable future comparisons and to make our research reproducible.

Summary: 
The study focuses on using a machine learning ensemble to forecast the direction of Bitcoin prices. It challenges the notion that the closing price alone is insufficient for accurate forecasts in the stock market. Through experimentation, the relevance of different time series variables, such as Open, High, and Low prices, is examined, with Low having the most significant impact on directional accuracy when combined with a Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The study concludes that non-price-related Bitcoin features do not significantly contribute to improving directional accuracy. Overall, the proposed method matches the performance of existing state-of-the-art models in predicting the direction of Bitcoin prices. <div>
arXiv:2504.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that is gaining more popularity in recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not enough to forecast stock market series. We introduce a new set of time series and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy are Open, High and Low, with the largest contribution of Low in combination with an ensemble of Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the state-of-the-art when observing directional accuracy.

Summary: 
The article discusses the relationship between activation functions and spline regression in 1D shallow networks, exploring how this choice impacts spectral bias. It proposes that gradient descent can act as a shrinkage operator, controlling the number of frequency components retained in a neural network's Jacobian. The study reveals that GD regularization is effective when using monotonic activation functions and suggests a connection between GD hyperparameters and bandwidth. Additionally, it highlights the potential of non-monotonic activation functions such as sinc and Gaussian as efficient alternatives for managing spectral bias in neural networks. <div>
arXiv:2504.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the connection between activation function and spline regression/smoothing and characterize how this choice may influence spectral bias within a 1D shallow network. We then demonstrate how gradient descent (GD) can be reinterpreted as a shrinkage operator that masks the singular values of a neural network's Jacobian. Viewed this way, GD implicitly selects the number of frequency components to retain, thereby controlling the spectral bias. An explicit relationship is proposed between the choice of GD hyperparameters (learning rate & number of iterations) and bandwidth (the number of active components). GD regularization is shown to be effective only with monotonic activation functions. Finally, we highlight the utility of non-monotonic activation functions (sinc, Gaussian) as iteration-efficient surrogates for spectral bias.

Summary: 
This study explores the convergence of gradient methods for mean-field single hidden layer neural networks using square loss. By treating the problem as separable non-linear least squares linear w.r.t. the outer layer's weights, a Variable Projection (VarPro) algorithm is used to eliminate linear variables and focus on training the feature distribution. Unlike traditional approaches, this strategy allows for provable convergence rates by sampling a teacher feature distribution. As the regularization strength approaches zero, the dynamics of the feature distribution resemble a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Leveraging recent research on the behavior of such PDEs, the study provides guarantees for the trained feature distribution to converge to the teacher feature distribution in a teacher-student setup. <div>

Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field single hidden layer neural networks with square loss. Observing this is a separable non-linear least-square problem which is linear w.r.t. the outer layer's weights, we consider a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the learning problem to the training of the feature distribution. Whereas most convergence rates or the training of neural networks rely on a neural tangent kernel analysis where features are fixed, we show such a strategy enables provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution. Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted ultra-fast diffusion equation. Relying on recent results on the asymptotic behavior of such PDEs, we obtain guarantees for the convergence of the trained feature distribution towards the teacher feature distribution in a teacher-student setup.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery lifespan is vital for ensuring operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs in applications like electric vehicles and smart grids. This study presents a hybrid learning framework for precise battery lifespan prediction, integrating dynamic multi-source data fusion with a stacked ensemble (SE) modeling approach. By leveraging heterogeneous datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE), MIT-Stanford-Toyota Research Institute (TRC), and nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) chemistries, an entropy-based dynamic weighting mechanism mitigates variability across heterogeneous datasets. The SE model combines Ridge regression, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), effectively capturing temporal dependencies and nonlinear degradation patterns. It achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0058, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0092, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9839, outperforming established baseline models with a 46.2% improvement in R2 and an 83.2% reduction in RMSE. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis identifies differential discharge capacity (Qdlin) and temperature of measurement (Temp_m) as critical aging indicators. This scalable, interpretable framework enhances battery health management, supporting optimized maintenance and safety across diverse energy storage systems, thereby contributing to improved battery health management in energy storage systems.

DualRAG is a novel framework designed for Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks, integrating reasoning and retrieval processes. It consists of Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA) components that work synergistically to enhance multi-step reasoning across diverse knowledge domains. RaQ guides the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, while pKA ensures systematic integration of newly acquired knowledge to support coherent reasoning. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG maintains its sophisticated capabilities in smaller-scale models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach significantly improves answer accuracy and coherence, even surpassing performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. DualRAG emerges as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications, posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. These results establish DualRAG as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to decision tree estimation by incorporating a fairness criterion at the local level of tree nodes. The proposed method, called Constrained Logistic Regression Tree (C-LRT), modifies the standard CART algorithm by using locally linear classifiers and constraints inspired by Constrained Logistic Regression. By integrating fairness considerations into the tree estimation process, C-LRT aims to balance accuracy and fairness in classification tasks. The authors demonstrate the relation between the proposed fairness criterion and the popular Statistical Parity criterion in Algorithmic Fairness literature. Experimental results on standard datasets commonly used in fairness research validate the effectiveness of C-LRT in achieving fair and accurate classification outcomes. <div>
arXiv:2504.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the high computational complexity of decision tree estimation, classical methods construct a tree by adding one node at a time in a recursive way. To facilitate promoting fairness, we propose a fairness criterion local to the tree nodes. We prove how it is related to the Statistical Parity criterion, popular in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, and show how to incorporate it into standard recursive tree estimation algorithms.
  We present a tree estimation algorithm called Constrained Logistic Regression Tree (C-LRT), which is a modification of the standard CART algorithm using locally linear classifiers and imposing restrictions as done in Constrained Logistic Regression.
  Finally, we evaluate the performance of trees estimated with C-LRT on datasets commonly used in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, using various classification and fairness metrics. The results confirm that C-LRT successfully allows to control and balance accuracy and fairness.

<div> limitations, neural operators, Hughes model, hyperbolic systems, shock preservation
<br />
Summary:<br /> 
This paper explores the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for the Hughes model, a complex hyperbolic system representing crowd dynamics. Three types of neural operators were tested in various scenarios with different initial and boundary conditions. While performing well in simple scenarios, the neural operators struggled to accurately predict solutions in more complex situations with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundaries. The predicted solutions often appeared smoother, lacking important physical features like shock waves. This smoothing effect raises concerns about the operators' ability to capture transport dynamics with discontinuities, similar to the issues observed with models introducing artificial diffusion. These findings suggest that current neural operator architectures may unintentionally regularize the solutions, limiting their applicability to scenarios where shock preservation is crucial, such as in traffic applications. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

<div> Bayesian statistical mechanical system, linear response framework, neural network, interpretability, susceptibility<br />
Summary:<br />
In this study, a linear response framework was developed for interpretability by treating neural networks as Bayesian statistical mechanical systems. By perturbing the data distribution, a first-order change in the network's observables can be induced, allowing for the estimation of susceptibilities with local samples. These susceptibilities serve as attribution scores, aiding in the interpretation of the network's behavior. By constructing a response matrix from a set of perturbations, functional modules within the network, such as multigram and induction heads, can be identified. The susceptibilities link learning coefficients with linear-response theory, shedding light on how the local loss landscape geometry changes with shifts in the data distribution. <div>

Abstract: We develop a linear response framework for interpretability that treats a neural network as a Bayesian statistical mechanical system. A small, controlled perturbation of the data distribution, for example shifting the Pile toward GitHub or legal text, induces a first-order change in the posterior expectation of an observable localized on a chosen component of the network. The resulting susceptibility can be estimated efficiently with local SGLD samples and factorizes into signed, per-token contributions that serve as attribution scores. Building a set of perturbations (probes) yields a response matrix whose low-rank structure separates functional modules such as multigram and induction heads in a 3M-parameter transformer. Susceptibilities link local learning coefficients from singular learning theory with linear-response theory, and quantify how local loss landscape geometry deforms under shifts in the data distribution.

Summary:
This paper discusses the importance of probability calibration in AI and ML models, highlighting the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy. It presents a review of 82 probability calibration metrics for both classifier and object detection models. The metrics are organized into different categories, including point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative families. The paper provides equations for each metric to aid implementation and comparison by researchers. Understanding calibration is crucial when combining outputs from multiple systems, ensuring safety and reliability in critical situations, and building trust in models. Probability calibration metrics offer an independent assessment of model performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics, giving insights into how confident a model's predictions truly are. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers in the field of AI and ML. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Probabilities or confidence values produced by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models often do not reflect their true accuracy, with some models being under or over confident in their predictions. For example, if a model is 80% sure of an outcome, is it correct 80% of the time? Probability calibration metrics measure the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy, providing an independent assessment of model calibration performance that complements traditional accuracy metrics. Understanding calibration is important when the outputs of multiple systems are combined, for assurance in safety or business-critical contexts, and for building user trust in models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of probability calibration metrics for classifier and object detection models, organising them according to a number of different categorisations to highlight their relationships. We identify 82 major metrics, which can be grouped into four classifier families (point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative) and an object detection family. For each metric, we provide equations where available, facilitating implementation and comparison by future researchers.

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for navigation in large, visually complex environments with sparse rewards. The approach utilizes object-oriented macro actions based on a topological map, enabling a simple Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn effective navigation policies. By detecting objects and selecting discrete macro actions corresponding to navigating to these objects, the agent builds a map, reducing the complexity of the reinforcement learning problem and allowing for generalization to new environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of navigation in large, visually complex environments with sparse rewards. We propose a method that uses object-oriented macro actions grounded in a topological map, allowing a simple Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn effective navigation policies. The agent builds a map by detecting objects from RGBD input and selecting discrete macro actions that correspond to navigating to these objects. This abstraction drastically reduces the complexity of the underlying reinforcement learning problem and enables generalization to unseen environments. We evaluate our approach in a photorealistic 3D simulation and show that it significantly outperforms a random baseline under both immediate and terminal reward conditions. Our results demonstrate that topological structure and macro-level abstraction can enable sample-efficient learning even from pixel data.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential for facilitating diverse socio-economic activity and environmental conservation initiatives. Deep learning techniques are increasingly being explored as complementary approaches to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, offering potential benefits such as reduced complexity and enhanced adaptability in specific applications. This work presents a novel design, Small Shuffled Attention UNet (SSA-UNet), which enhances SmaAt-UNet's architecture by including a shuffle channeling mechanism to optimize performance and diminish complexity. To assess its efficacy, this architecture and its reduced variant are examined and trained on two datasets: a Dutch precipitation dataset from 2016 to 2019, and a French cloud cover dataset containing radar images from 2017 to 2018. Three output configurations of the proposed architecture are evaluated, yielding outputs of 1, 6, and 12 precipitation maps, respectively. To better understand how this model operates and produces its predictions, a gradient-based approach called Grad-CAM is used to analyze the outputs generated. The analysis of heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM facilitated the identification of regions within the input maps that the model considers most informative for generating its predictions. The implementation of SSA-UNet can be found on our Github\footnote{\href{https://github.com/MarcoTurzi/SSA-UNet}{https://github.com/MarcoTurzi/SSA-UNet}}

Abstract: Balancing performance and interpretability in multivariate time series classification is a significant challenge due to data complexity and high dimensionality. This paper introduces PHeatPruner, a method integrating persistent homology and sheaf theory to address these challenges. Persistent homology facilitates the pruning of up to 45% of the applied variables while maintaining or enhancing the accuracy of models such as Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, all without depending on posterior probabilities or supervised optimization algorithms. Concurrently, sheaf theory contributes explanatory vectors that provide deeper insights into the data's structural nuances. The approach was validated using the UEA Archive and a mastitis detection dataset for dairy cows. The results demonstrate that PHeatPruner effectively preserves model accuracy. Furthermore, our results highlight PHeatPruner's key features, i.e. simplifying complex data and offering actionable insights without increasing processing time or complexity. This method bridges the gap between complexity reduction and interpretability, suggesting promising applications in various fields.

Abstract: The biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models can lead to automated decision-making processes that discriminate against groups and/or individuals based on sensitive properties such as gender and race. While there are many studies on diagnosing and mitigating biases in various AI models, there is little research on individual fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike traditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their inter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where nodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model complex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these connections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness violations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and ensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the literature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define, measure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual fairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring fairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and mitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case studies, focusing on graph-based large language models.

arXiv:2504.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks presents significant mobility management challenges, primarily due to frequent handovers caused by probabilistic line-of-sight conditions with multiple ground base stations (BSs). To tackle these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, particularly deep Q-networks (DQN), have been employed to optimize handover decisions dynamically. However, a major drawback of these learning-based approaches is their black-box nature, which limits interpretability in the decision-making process. This paper introduces an explainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence handover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying the impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our approach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover solutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network performance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that our method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively bridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers.

Summary:<br />Missing labels in supervised learning can introduce bias, especially in cases of Missing Not At Random (MNAR) data. To address this issue, a multiple imputation technique is proposed for evaluating classifiers using metrics like precision and ROC-AUC. This method provides point estimates and a predictive distribution for these metrics when labels are missing. Empirical results show that the predictive distribution accurately represents the location and shape of the metrics, even in MNAR scenarios. The distribution is shown to be approximately Gaussian, with finite-sample convergence bounds established. A robustness proof confirms the validity of the approximation under a realistic error model. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Missing data in supervised learning is well-studied, but the specific issue of missing labels during model evaluation has been overlooked. Ignoring samples with missing values, a common solution, can introduce bias, especially when data is Missing Not At Random (MNAR). We propose a multiple imputation technique for evaluating classifiers using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. This method not only offers point estimates but also a predictive distribution for these quantities when labels are missing. We empirically show that the predictive distribution's location and shape are generally correct, even in the MNAR regime. Moreover, we establish that this distribution is approximately Gaussian and provide finite-sample convergence bounds. Additionally, a robustness proof is presented, confirming the validity of the approximation under a realistic error model.

Summary: 
This article explores the concept of calibration in predictive systems, focusing on the notions of self-realization and precise loss estimation. The authors propose prototypical definitions for calibration based on outcome distribution properties such as the mean or median. The self-realization concept, termed $\Gamma$-calibration, is linked to swap regret and omniprediction learning. The precise loss estimation concept is derived from decision calibration and actuarial fairness principles. For binary outcomes, both definitions coincide, while in higher-dimensional outcomes, they can be unified under distribution calibration with respect to a property. The role of groupings in achieving multicalibration is also discussed. Overall, the article offers a semantic map of calibration to help navigate the diverse range of definitions and concepts in the field. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueled by discussions around "trustworthiness" and algorithmic fairness, calibration of predictive systems has regained scholars attention. The vanilla definition and understanding of calibration is, simply put, on all days on which the rain probability has been predicted to be p, the actual frequency of rain days was p. However, the increased attention has led to an immense variety of new notions of "calibration." Some of the notions are incomparable, serve different purposes, or imply each other. In this work, we provide two accounts which motivate calibration: self-realization of forecasted properties and precise estimation of incurred losses of the decision makers relying on forecasts. We substantiate the former via the reflection principle and the latter by actuarial fairness. For both accounts we formulate prototypical definitions via properties $\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or median. The prototypical definition for self-realization, which we call $\Gamma$-calibration, is equivalent to a certain type of swap regret under certain conditions. These implications are strongly connected to the omniprediction learning paradigm. The prototypical definition for precise loss estimation is a modification of decision calibration adopted from Zhao et al. [73]. For binary outcome sets both prototypical definitions coincide under appropriate choices of reference properties. For higher-dimensional outcome sets, both prototypical definitions can be subsumed by a natural extension of the binary definition, called distribution calibration with respect to a property. We conclude by commenting on the role of groupings in both accounts of calibration often used to obtain multicalibration. In sum, this work provides a semantic map of calibration in order to navigate a fragmented terrain of notions and definitions.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on online/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in porous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless numbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified numerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic control of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and online learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This strategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying a single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning the attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work performs a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning features), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate a decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate, realistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model into an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\% reduction in computational time.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in machine learning, yet most (axiomatic) studies of uncertainty measures focus on classification, leaving a gap in regression settings with limited formal justification and evaluations. In this work, we introduce a set of axioms to rigorously assess measures of aleatoric, epistemic, and total uncertainty in supervised regression.

Our findings provide a principled foundation for UQ in regression, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.

Summary:
In this study, IoT sensors were deployed in strawberry production polytunnels for two growing seasons to collect environmental data and yield records.

Abstract: Due to rapid population growth globally, digitally-enabled agricultural sectors are crucial for sustainable food production and making informed decisions about resource management for farmers and various stakeholders. The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that collect real-time observations of various environmental (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and operational factors (e.g., irrigation) influencing production is often seen as a critical step to enable additional novel downstream tasks, such as AI-based yield forecasting. However, since AI models require large amounts of data, this creates practical challenges in a real-world dynamic farm setting where IoT observations would need to be collected over a number of seasons. In this study, we deployed IoT sensors in strawberry production polytunnels for two growing seasons to collect environmental data, including water usage, external and internal temperature, external and internal humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sensor observations were combined with manually provided yield records spanning a period of four seasons. To bridge the gap of missing IoT observations for two additional seasons, we propose an AI-based backcasting approach to generate synthetic sensor observations using historical weather data from a nearby weather station and the existing polytunnel observations. We built an AI-based yield forecasting model to evaluate our approach using the combination of real and synthetic observations. Our results demonstrated that incorporating synthetic data improved yield forecasting accuracy, with models incorporating synthetic data outperforming those trained only on historical yield, weather records, and real sensor data.

<div> Keywords: AI scaling trends, distributed deep learning, data parallelism, pseudo-synchronization, PALSGD

Summary:
PALSGD is introduced as a method to enhance the efficiency of data-parallel training for large-scale models trained on extensive datasets, addressing communication bottlenecks. It builds upon Local SGD and DiLoCo, introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism to reduce communication frequency while maintaining model consistency. The theoretical analysis confirms PALSGD's convergence and establishes its convergence rate. Results from image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that PALSGD outperforms existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel, achieving faster training times by 18.4% on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% on TinyStories with GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M. This advancement in distributed deep learning techniques showcases the potential of PALSGD for accelerating training of large-scale models on exascale computational resources.

Abstract: Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD (PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023), designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new approach for transition path sampling (TPS) in atomistic systems using pre-trained generative models. By interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of generative models, the authors show how to repurpose existing models for TPS without the need for task-specific training. This method leverages recent advances in atomistic machine learning and enables the generation of diverse and physically realistic transition pathways in a zero-shot manner. The approach is demonstrated on various molecular systems and shows generalization beyond the original training dataset. It can be easily integrated into new generative models, making it a practical and efficient technique as models continue to improve with more data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

<div> Keywords: Federated learning, Wireless networks, Malicious attacks, Defense techniques, Deep reinforcement learning<br />
Summary:<br />
This article explores the use of federated learning in wireless networks to improve energy efficiency through a cell sleep control scenario. The dynamic nature of wireless environments poses a challenge as it increases vulnerability to malicious attacks. Two intelligent attack models, including a generative adversarial network (GAN)-enhanced model poisoning attack and regularization-based model poisoning attack, are proposed. To counter these attacks, two defense schemes are introduced: autoencoder-based defense and knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled defense. The autoencoder-based method identifies malicious participants, allowing for the aggregation of only benign local models during global aggregation. On the other hand, the KD-based defense protects the model by controlling the knowledge transfer between the global and local models. These defense techniques aim to mitigate the risk of attacks and ensure the security and reliability of federated learning in wireless networks. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for learning-based functions in wireless networks, thanks to its distributed implementation capability. On the other hand, distributed learning may increase the risk of exposure to malicious attacks where attacks on a local model may spread to other models by parameter exchange. Meanwhile, such attacks can be hard to detect due to the dynamic wireless environment, especially considering local models can be heterogeneous with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the effect of malicious attacks and develop advanced defense techniques for FL-enabled wireless networks. In this work, we introduce a federated deep reinforcement learning-based cell sleep control scenario that enhances the energy efficiency of the network. We propose multiple intelligent attacks targeting the learning-based approach and we propose defense methods to mitigate such attacks. In particular, we have designed two attack models, generative adversarial network (GAN)-enhanced model poisoning attack and regularization-based model poisoning attack. As a counteraction, we have proposed two defense schemes, autoencoder-based defense, and knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled defense. The autoencoder-based defense method leverages an autoencoder to identify the malicious participants and only aggregate the parameters of benign local models during the global aggregation, while KD-based defense protects the model from attacks by controlling the knowledge transferred between the global model and local models.

<title>Generalization Capability for Imitation Learning</title>

Abstract: Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile skills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on finite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability of imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data distribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper bounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate representations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters and the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance for designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly in determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders (e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to achieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high conditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood landscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In addition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from sharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima under fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning often exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only scaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of output labels conditioned on the same input.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of an extended neuroevolutionary approach, based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), for autonomous robots in dynamic environments associated with hazardous tasks like firefighting, urban search-and-rescue (USAR), and industrial inspections. Building on previous research, it expands the simulation environment to larger and more complex settings, demonstrating NEAT's adaptability across different applications.

Experimental results show that NEAT-evolved controllers achieve success rates comparable to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, with superior structural adaptability. The agents reached ~80% success in outdoor tests, surpassing baseline models. The paper also highlights the benefits of transfer learning among tasks and evaluates the effectiveness of NEAT in complex 3D navigation. Contributions include evaluating NEAT for diverse autonomous applications and discussing real-world deployment considerations, emphasizing the approach's potential as an alternative or complement to deep reinforcement learning in autonomous navigation tasks.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving cloud platforms and the escalating complexity of network traffic demand proper network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to ensure network security and performance. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task, the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false positive rate.

Abstract: Representation learning, a task of learning latent vectors to represent entities, is a key task in improving search and recommender systems in web applications. Various representation learning methods have been developed, including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities, sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities, and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage code by the time of publication.

Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information. However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability. To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study, the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to conventional deep learning for medical image classification.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state--observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

<title>Flow Matching Ergodic Coverage</title>

Abstract: Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied agents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a target distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is measured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are constrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control synthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique widely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We formally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form solution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative inference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were previously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no computational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational gradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the target distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on the other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an optimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on non-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved performance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through comprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing and erasing tasks on a Franka robot.

<title>SOFARI-R: High-Dimensional Manifold-Based Inference for Latent Responses</title>

Abstract: Data reduction with uncertainty quantification plays a key role in various multi-task learning applications, where large numbers of responses and features are present. To this end, a general framework of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference (SOFARI) was introduced recently in Zheng, Zhou, Fan and Lv (2024) for interpretable multi-task learning inference focusing on the left factor vectors and singular values exploiting the latent singular value decomposition (SVD) structure. Yet, designing a valid inference procedure on the latent right factor vectors is not straightforward from that of the left ones and can be even more challenging due to asymmetry of left and right singular vectors in the response matrix. To tackle these issues, in this paper we suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for latent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced. The first variant deals with strongly orthogonal factors by coupling left singular vectors with the design matrix and then appropriately rescaling them to generate new Stiefel manifolds. The second variant handles the more general weakly orthogonal factors by employing the hard-thresholded SOFARI estimates and delicately incorporating approximation errors into the distribution. Both variants produce bias-corrected estimators for the latent right factor vectors that enjoy asymptotically normal distributions with justified asymptotic variance estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly suggested method using extensive simulation studies and an economic application.

Abstract: Digital systems find it challenging to keep up with cybersecurity threats. The daily emergence of more than 560,000 new malware strains poses significant hazards to the digital ecosystem. The traditional malware detection methods fail to operate properly and yield high false positive rates with low accuracy of the protection system. This study explores the ways in which malware can be detected using these machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to address those shortcomings. This study also includes a systematic comparison of the performance of some of the widely used ML models, such as random forest, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and deep neural network (DNN), for determining the effectiveness of the domain of modern malware threat systems. We use a considerable-sized database from Kaggle, which has undergone optimized feature selection and preprocessing to improve model performance. Our finding suggests that the DNN model outperformed the other traditional models with the highest training accuracy of 99.92% and an almost perfect AUC score. Furthermore, the feature selection and preprocessing can help improve the capabilities of detection. This research makes an important contribution by analyzing the performance of the model on the performance metrics and providing insight into the effectiveness of the advanced detection techniques to build more robust and more reliable cybersecurity solutions against the growing malware threats.

<title>Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Quality Shifts on Video Streaming Over 5G</title>

Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts. Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can be used to improve OTT services.

<title>A computational model of infant sensorimotor exploration in the mobile paradigm</title>

Abstract: We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infants' behavior in the "mobile paradigm". This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that "connected" limb. This ability to detect a "sensorimotor contingency" is considered to be a foundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.

Abstract: Phishing detection on Ethereum has increasingly leveraged advanced machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions. However, limited attention has been given to understanding the effectiveness of feature selection strategies and the role of graph-based models in enhancing detection accuracy. In this paper, we systematically examine these issues by analyzing and contrasting explicit transactional features and implicit graph-based features, both experimentally and analytically. We explore how different feature sets impact the performance of phishing detection models, particularly in the context of Ethereum's transactional network. Additionally, we address key challenges such as class imbalance and dataset composition and their influence on the robustness and precision of detection methods. Our findings demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each feature type, while also providing a clearer understanding of how feature affect model resilience and generalization in adversarial environments.

Abstract: In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the three-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer function (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful interpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

Abstract: Today's robots learn new tasks by imitating human examples. However, this standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those behaviors. Without understanding the features that factor into the human's decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the data and fail to perform the task when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective: instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should take, we also enable humans to indicate task-relevant features using markers and language prompts. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature representation that causally informs human actions. CIVIL then applies these causal features to train a transformer-based policy that emulates human behaviors without being confused by visual distractors. Our simulations, real-world experiments, and user study demonstrate that robots trained with CIVIL can learn from fewer human demonstrations and perform better than state-of-the-art baselines, especially in previously unseen scenarios.

Abstract: The ability to predict trajectories of surrounding agents and obstacles is a crucial component in many robotic applications. Data-driven approaches are commonly adopted for state prediction in scenarios where the underlying dynamics are unknown. However, the performance, reliability, and uncertainty of data-driven predictors become compromised when encountering out-of-distribution observations relative to the training data. In this paper, we introduce a Plug-and-Play Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PnP-PIML) framework to address this challenge. Our method employs conformal prediction to identify outlier dynamics and, in that case, switches from a nominal predictor to a physics-consistent model, namely distributed Port-Hamiltonian systems (dPHS). We leverage Gaussian processes to model the energy function of the dPHS, enabling not only the learning of system dynamics but also the quantification of predictive uncertainty through its Bayesian nature. In this way, the proposed framework produces reliable physics-informed predictions even for the out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Generative conversational interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) typically stream output token-by-token at a rate determined by computational budget, often neglecting actual human reading speeds and the cognitive load associated with the content. This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing computational resources for other users. Our statistical analysis of computational savings, combined with crowdsourced user studies, provides insights into the trade-offs between service efficiency and user satisfaction, demonstrating that our method can significantly reduce computational consumption up to 16.8\%. This context-aware computational resource management strategy presents a practical framework for enhancing system efficiency in cloud-based conversational AI interfaces without compromising user experience.

Abstract: With the rapid digitalization of healthcare systems, there has been a substantial increase in the generation and sharing of private health data. Safeguarding patient information is essential for maintaining consumer trust and ensuring compliance with legal data protection regulations. Machine learning is critical in healthcare, supporting personalized treatment, early disease detection, predictive analytics, image interpretation, drug discovery, efficient operations, and patient monitoring. It enhances decision-making, accelerates research, reduces errors, and improves patient outcomes. In this paper, we utilize machine learning methodologies, including differential privacy and federated learning, to develop privacy-preserving models that enable healthcare stakeholders to extract insights without compromising individual privacy. Differential privacy introduces noise to data to guarantee statistical privacy, while federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized datasets. We explore applying these technologies to Heart Disease Data, demonstrating how they preserve privacy while delivering valuable insights and comprehensive analysis. Our results show that using a federated learning model with differential privacy achieved a test accuracy of 85%, ensuring patient data remained secure and private throughout the process.

<title>Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition</title>

Abstract: Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.

Abstract: One of the enduring problems surrounding neural networks is to identify the factors that differentiate them from traditional statistical models. We prove a pair of results which distinguish feedforward neural networks among parametric models at the population level, for regression tasks. Firstly, we prove that for any pair of random variables $(X,Y)$, neural networks always learn a nontrivial relationship between $X$ and $Y$, if one exists. Secondly, we prove that for reasonable smooth parametric models, under local and global identifiability conditions, there exists a nontrivial $(X,Y)$ pair for which the parametric model learns the constant predictor $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. Together, our results suggest that a lack of identifiability distinguishes neural networks among the class of smooth parametric models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b, Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the capability to detect when its hallucinating.

Abstract: Identification of defects or anomalies in 3D objects is a crucial task to ensure correct functionality. In this work, we combine Bayesian learning with recent developments in quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, specifically orthogonal neural networks, to tackle this anomaly detection problem for an industrially relevant use case. Bayesian learning enables uncertainty quantification of predictions, while orthogonality in weight matrices enables smooth training. We develop orthogonal (quantum) versions of 3D convolutional neural networks and show that these models can successfully detect anomalies in 3D objects. To test the feasibility of incorporating quantum computers into a quantum-enhanced anomaly detection pipeline, we perform hardware experiments with our models on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane device, testing the effect of noise and limited measurement shots.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories, where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field theories, normalizing flows, and how the latter can be applied to study the former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in various recent research schools.

Abstract: Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain. Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by, contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning prediction, and disease progression modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are typically trained on vast amounts of data from various sources. Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts), LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity, privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least 77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.

Abstract: We introduce PerfCam, an open source Proof-of-Concept (PoC) digital twinning framework that combines camera and sensory data with 3D Gaussian Splatting and computer vision models for digital twinning, object tracking, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) extraction in industrial production lines. By utilizing 3D reconstruction and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), PerfCam offers a semi-automated approach to object tracking and spatial mapping, enabling digital twins that capture real-time KPIs such as availability, performance, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and rate of conveyor belts in the production line. We validate the effectiveness of PerfCam through a practical deployment within realistic test production lines in the pharmaceutical industry and contribute an openly published dataset to support further research and development in the field. The results demonstrate PerfCam's ability to deliver actionable insights through its precise digital twin capabilities, underscoring its value as an effective tool for developing usable digital twins in smart manufacturing environments and extracting operational analytics.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering (DSC) algorithms face several challenges that hinder their widespread adoption across variois application domains. First, clustering quality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer, disregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second, most DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as independent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the availability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly based on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their performance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled data. To address this limitations, we introduce a novel single-view DSC approach that: (i) minimizes a layer-wise self expression loss using a joint representation matrix; (ii) optimizes a subspace-structured norm to enhance clustering quality; (iii) employs a multi-stage sequential learning framework, consisting of pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling the use of multiple regularization terms without hyperparameter tuning; (iv) incorporates a relative error-based self-stopping mechanism to terminate training without labels; and (v) retains a fixed number of leading coefficients in the learned representation matrix based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed method on six datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. The results show that our method outperforms most linear SC algorithms with careffulyl tuned hyperparameters while maintaining competitive performance with the best performing linear appoaches.

Abstract: The integration of language models in the legal domain holds considerable promise for streamlining processes and improving efficiency in managing extensive workloads. However, the specialized terminology, nuanced language, and formal style of legal texts can present substantial challenges. This study examines whether preference-based training techniques, specifically Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization, can enhance models' performance in generating Icelandic legal summaries that align with domain-specific language standards and user preferences. We compare models fine-tuned with preference training to those using conventional supervised learning. Results indicate that preference training improves the legal accuracy of generated summaries over standard fine-tuning but does not significantly enhance the overall quality of Icelandic language usage. Discrepancies between automated metrics and human evaluations further underscore the importance of qualitative assessment in developing language models for the legal domain.

Abstract: This paper investigates regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for estimating nonlinear operators from a Polish space to a separable Hilbert space. We assume that the regression operator lies in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued kernel. Two significant settings are considered: an online setting with polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, and a finite-horizon setting with constant step sizes and regularization parameters. We introduce regularity conditions on the structure and smoothness of the target operator and the input random variables. Under these conditions, we provide a dimension-free convergence analysis for the prediction and estimation errors, deriving both expectation and high-probability error bounds. Our analysis demonstrates that these convergence rates are nearly optimal. Furthermore, we present a new technique for deriving bounds with high probability for general SGD schemes, which also ensures almost-sure convergence. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to more general operator-valued kernels and the encoder-decoder framework.

Abstract: Railway systems, particularly in Germany, require high levels of automation to address legacy infrastructure challenges and increase train traffic safely. A key component of automation is robust long-range perception, essential for early hazard detection, such as obstacles at level crossings or pedestrians on tracks. Unlike automotive systems with braking distances of ~70 meters, trains require perception ranges exceeding 1 km. This paper presents an deep-learning-based approach for long-range 3D object detection tailored for autonomous trains. The method relies solely on monocular images, inspired by the Faraway-Frustum approach, and incorporates LiDAR data during training to improve depth estimation. The proposed pipeline consists of four key modules: (1) a modified YOLOv9 for 2.5D object detection, (2) a depth estimation network, and (3-4) dedicated short- and long-range 3D detection heads. Evaluations on the OSDaR23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in detecting objects up to 250 meters. Results highlight its potential for railway automation and outline areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) for high-dimensional regression (HDR) is an important problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited sample size in the target task. However, there currently lacks a method to quantify the statistical significance of the relationship between features and the response in TL-HDR settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical inference framework for assessing the reliability of feature selection in TL-HDR, called PTL-SI (Post-TL Statistical Inference). The core contribution of PTL-SI is its ability to provide valid $p$-values to features selected in TL-HDR, thereby rigorously controlling the false positive rate (FPR) at desired significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Furthermore, we enhance statistical power by incorporating a strategic divide-and-conquer approach into our framework. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed PTL-SI through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional datasets, confirming its theoretical properties and utility in testing the reliability of feature selection in TL scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread integration of new technologies in low-voltage distribution networks on the consumer side creates the need for distribution system operators to perform advanced real-time calculations to estimate network conditions. In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.

Abstract: This paper introduces decentralized and modular neural network framework designed to enhance the scalability, interpretability, and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. At the heart of this framework is a dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of neural network behavior. Furthermore, the paper explores the application of federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments, particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular networks can be efficiently trained and evaluated. The proposed framework also addresses scalability, enabling AI systems to handle large datasets and distributed processing while preserving model transparency and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach in advancing the design of scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient AI systems for diverse applications.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on multi-turn reasoning datasets.

Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.

Abstract: This contribution explores the impact of synthetic training data usage and the prediction of material wear and aging in the context of re-identification. Different experimental setups and gallery set expanding strategies are tested, analyzing their impact on performance over time for aging re-identification subjects. Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our mean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by step. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data, Rank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model trained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance on hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source re-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696 images of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time, natural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during their usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance of the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically aged pallets or other wooden materials.

Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is a fundamental technique for decomposing multi-dimensional data into a low-rank tensor and an outlier tensor, yet existing methods relying on sparse outlier assumptions often fail under structured corruptions. In this paper, we propose a self-guided data augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency. Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery, background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers, extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves $2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.

Abstract: We present Kimi-Audio, an open-source audio foundation model that excels in audio understanding, generation, and conversation. We detail the practices in building Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training recipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a 12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous features as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise streaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset that consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range of modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to construct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a pre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text data with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a diverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including speech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech conversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the evaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio.

Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular, we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.

<title>Generalization Guarantees for Multi-View Representation Learning and Application to Regularization via Gaussian Product Mixture Prior</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of distributed multi-view representation learning. In this problem, $K$ agents observe each one distinct, possibly statistically correlated, view and independently extracts from it a suitable representation in a manner that a decoder that gets all $K$ representations estimates correctly the hidden label. In the absence of any explicit coordination between the agents, a central question is: what should each agent extract from its view that is necessary and sufficient for a correct estimation at the decoder? In this paper, we investigate this question from a generalization error perspective. First, we establish several generalization bounds in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from training and "test" datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for all views and training and test datasets. Then, we use the obtained bounds to devise a regularizer; and investigate in depth the question of the selection of a suitable prior. In particular, we show and conduct experiments that illustrate that our data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors with judiciously chosen weights lead to good performance. For single-view settings (i.e., $K=1$), our experimental results are shown to outperform existing prior art Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches. Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in this setting. Finally, for the multi-view setting, we show that the selection of the joint prior as a Gaussians product mixture induces a Gaussian mixture marginal prior for each marginal view and implicitly encourages the agents to extract and output redundant features, a finding which is somewhat counter-intuitive.

Abstract: Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the 2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution.

Abstract: Functional survival models are key tools for analyzing time-to-event data with complex predictors, such as functional or high-dimensional inputs. Despite their predictive strength, these models often lack interpretability, which limits their value in practical decision-making and risk analysis. This study investigates two key survival models: the Functional Survival Tree (FST) and the Functional Random Survival Forest (FRSF). It introduces novel methods and tools to enhance the interpretability of FST models and improve the explainability of FRSF ensembles. Using both real and simulated datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed approaches yield efficient, easy-to-understand decision trees that accurately capture the underlying decision-making processes of the model ensemble.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators (PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse) orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis, the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.

Abstract: We consider the problem of modelling the effects of unseen perturbations such as gene knockdowns or drug combinations on low-level measurements such as RNA sequencing data. Specifically, given data collected under some perturbations, we aim to predict the distribution of measurements for new perturbations. To address this challenging extrapolation task, we posit that perturbations act additively in a suitable, unknown embedding space. More precisely, we formulate the generative process underlying the observed data as a latent variable model, in which perturbations amount to mean shifts in latent space and can be combined additively. Unlike previous work, we prove that, given sufficiently diverse training perturbations, the representation and perturbation effects are identifiable up to affine transformation, and use this to characterize the class of unseen perturbations for which we obtain extrapolation guarantees. To estimate the model from data, we propose a new method, the perturbation distribution autoencoder (PDAE), which is trained by maximising the distributional similarity between true and predicted perturbation distributions. The trained model can then be used to predict previously unseen perturbation distributions. Empirical evidence suggests that PDAE compares favourably to existing methods and baselines at predicting the effects of unseen perturbations.

Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific and deception-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: "Mafia", "Debate", "Backdoor Code" and "Wargames". For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability (using Chatbot Arena Elo as a proxy for general capability). We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. In our numerical examples, the NSO success rate is below 52% when overseeing systems that are 400 Elo points stronger than the baseline overseer, and it declines further for overseeing even stronger systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead, adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly extends to composite attributes.

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.

Abstract: Recent progress in geometric deep learning has drawn increasing attention from the machine learning community toward domain adaptation on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, especially for neuroimaging data that often suffer from distribution shifts across sessions. These data, typically represented as covariance matrices of brain signals, inherently lie on SPD manifolds due to their symmetry and positive definiteness. However, conventional domain adaptation methods often overlook this geometric structure when applied directly to covariance matrices, which can result in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new geometric deep learning framework that combines optimal transport theory with the geometry of SPD manifolds. Our approach aligns data distributions while respecting the manifold structure, effectively reducing both marginal and conditional discrepancies. We validate our method on three cross-session brain computer interface datasets, KU, BNCI2014001, and BNCI2015001, where it consistently outperforms baseline approaches while maintaining the intrinsic geometry of the data. We also provide quantitative results and visualizations to better illustrate the behavior of the learned embeddings.

Abstract: In neural architecture search (NAS) methods based on latent space optimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural architectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance.

Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to reduce the computational burden of mobile devices and decrease the end-to-end inference latency in edge computing scenarios. While distributed DNNs have been studied, to the best of our knowledge, the resilience of distributed DNNs to adversarial action remains an open problem. In this paper, we fill the existing research gap by rigorously analyzing the robustness of distributed DNNs against adversarial action. We cast this problem in the context of information theory and rigorously proved that (i) the compressed latent dimension improves the robustness but also affect task-oriented performance; and (ii) the deeper splitting point enhances the robustness but also increases the computational burden. These two trade-offs provide a novel perspective to design robust distributed DNN. To test our theoretical findings, we perform extensive experimental analysis by considering 6 different DNN architectures, 6 different approaches for distributed DNN and 10 different adversarial attacks using the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: In this paper we show how tensor networks help in developing explainability of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and apply it in the context of a real use-case of adversary-generated threat intelligence. Our investigation proves that MPS rival traditional deep learning models such as autoencoders and GANs in terms of performance, while providing much richer model interpretability. Our approach naturally facilitates the extraction of feature-wise probabilities, Von Neumann Entropy, and mutual information, offering a compelling narrative for classification of anomalies and fostering an unprecedented level of transparency and interpretability, something fundamental to understand the rationale behind artificial intelligence decisions.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the benefits of generating multiple synthetic datasets for supervised learning, from increased accuracy to more effective model selection and uncertainty estimation. These benefits have clear empirical support, but the theoretical understanding of them is currently very light. We seek to increase the theoretical understanding by deriving bias-variance decompositions for several settings of using multiple synthetic datasets, including differentially private synthetic data. Our theory yields a simple rule of thumb to select the appropriate number of synthetic datasets in the case of mean-squared error and Brier score. We investigate how our theory works in practice with several real datasets, downstream predictors and error metrics. As our theory predicts, multiple synthetic datasets often improve accuracy, while a single large synthetic dataset gives at best minimal improvement, showing that our insights are practically relevant.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning methods lack an inherent mechanism to impose behavioural constraints on the trained policies. Although certain extensions exist, they remain limited to specific types of constraints, such as value constraints with additional reward signals or visitation density constraints. In this work we unify these existing techniques and bridge the gap with classical optimization and control theory, using a generic primal-dual framework for value-based and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. The obtained dual formulations turn out to be especially useful for imposing additional constraints on the learned policy, as an intrinsic relationship between such dual constraints (or regularization terms) and reward modifications in the primal is revealed. Furthermore, using this framework, we are able to introduce some novel types of constraints, allowing to impose bounds on the policy's action density or on costs associated with transitions between consecutive states and actions. From the adjusted primal-dual optimization problems, a practical algorithm is derived that supports various combinations of policy constraints that are automatically handled throughout training using trainable reward modifications. The proposed $\texttt{DualCRL}$ method is examined in more detail and evaluated under different (combinations of) constraints on two interpretable environments. The results highlight the efficacy of the method, which ultimately provides the designer of such systems with a versatile toolbox of possible policy constraints.

Abstract: As modern scientific instruments generate vast amounts of data and the volume of information in the scientific literature continues to grow, machine learning (ML) has become an essential tool for organising, analysing, and interpreting these complex datasets. This paper explores the transformative role of ML in accelerating breakthroughs across a range of scientific disciplines. By presenting key examples -- such as brain mapping and exoplanet detection -- we demonstrate how ML is reshaping scientific research. We also explore different scenarios where different levels of knowledge of the underlying phenomenon are available, identifying strategies to overcome limitations and unlock the full potential of ML. Despite its advances, the growing reliance on ML poses challenges for research applications and rigorous validation of discoveries. We argue that even with these challenges, ML is poised to disrupt traditional methodologies and advance the boundaries of knowledge by enabling researchers to tackle increasingly complex problems. Thus, the scientific community can move beyond the necessary traditional oversimplifications to embrace the full complexity of natural systems, ultimately paving the way for interdisciplinary breakthroughs and innovative solutions to humanity's most pressing challenges.

Abstract: Extrinsic rewards can effectively guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents in specific tasks. However, extrinsic rewards frequently fall short in complex environments due to the significant human effort needed for their design and annotation. This limitation underscores the necessity for intrinsic rewards, which offer auxiliary and dense signals and can enable agents to learn in an unsupervised manner. Although various intrinsic reward formulations have been proposed, their implementation and optimization details are insufficiently explored and lack standardization, thereby hindering research progress. To address this gap, we introduce RLeXplore, a unified, highly modularized, and plug-and-play framework offering reliable implementations of eight state-of-the-art intrinsic reward methods. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth study that identifies critical implementation details and establishes well-justified standard practices in intrinsically-motivated RL. Our documentation, examples, and source code are available at https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/RLeXplore.

<title>Can Kernel Methods Explain How the Data Affects Neural Collapse?</title>

Abstract: A vast amount of literature has recently focused on the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within-class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. To address this limitation of UFMs, this paper explores the possibility of analyzing NC1 using kernels associated with shallow NNs. We begin by formulating an NC1 metric as a function of the kernel. Then, we specialize it to the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP) and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with wide networks at initialization and during gradient-based training with a small learning rate, respectively. As a key result, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for Gaussian data of arbitrary dimensions. This showcases the limitations of data-independent kernels such as NTK in approximating the NC behavior of NNs. As an alternative to NTK, we then empirically explore a recently proposed data-aware Gaussian Process kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model feature learning. We show that this kernel yields lower NC1 than NNGP but may not follow the trends of the shallow NN. Our study demonstrates that adaptivity to data may allow kernel-based analysis of NC, though further advancements in this area are still needed. A nice byproduct of our study is showing both theoretically and empirically that the choice of nonlinear activation function affects NC1 (with ERF yielding lower values than ReLU).

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an effective approach to combine multiple single-task models into a multitask model. This process typically involves computing a weighted average of the model parameters without any additional training. Existing model-merging methods focus on enhancing average task accuracy. However, interference and conflicts between the objectives of different tasks can lead to trade-offs during the merging process. In real-world applications, a set of solutions with various trade-offs can be more informative, helping practitioners make decisions based on diverse preferences. In this paper, we introduce a novel and low-compute algorithm, Model Merging with Amortized Pareto Front (MAP). MAP efficiently identifies a Pareto set of scaling coefficients for merging multiple models, reflecting the trade-offs involved. It amortizes the substantial computational cost of evaluations needed to estimate the Pareto front by using quadratic approximation surrogate models derived from a pre-selected set of scaling coefficients. Experimental results on vision and natural language processing tasks demonstrate that MAP can accurately identify the Pareto front, providing practitioners with flexible solutions to balance competing task objectives. We also introduce Bayesian MAP for scenarios with a relatively low number of tasks and Nested MAP for situations with a high number of tasks, further reducing the computational cost of evaluation.

Abstract: The outstanding performance of large foundational models across diverse tasks, from computer vision to speech and natural language processing, has significantly increased their demand. However, storing and transmitting these models poses significant challenges due to their massive size (e.g., 750GB for Llama 3.1 405B). Recent literature has focused on compressing the original weights or reducing the number of parameters required for fine-tuning these models. These compression methods generally constrain the parameter space, for example, through low-rank reparametrization (e.g., LoRA), pruning, or quantization (e.g., QLoRA) during or after the model training. In this paper, we present a novel model compression method, which we term Manifold-Constrained Neural Compression (MCNC). This method constrains the parameter space to low-dimensional pre-defined and frozen nonlinear manifolds, which effectively cover this space. Given the prevalence of good solutions in over-parameterized deep neural networks, we show that by constraining the parameter space to our proposed manifold, we can identify high-quality solutions while achieving unprecedented compression rates across a wide variety of tasks and architectures. Through extensive experiments in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of compression, accuracy, and/or model reconstruction time. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mint-vu/MCNC.

Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/GOFA.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/csm9493/efficient-llm-unlearning.

Abstract: This work describes a process for efficiently fine-tuning the GraphCast data-driven forecast model to simulate another analysis system, here the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Using two years of training data (July 2019 -- December 2021) and 37 GPU-days of computation to tune the 37-level, quarter-degree version of GraphCast, the resulting model significantly outperforms both the unmodified GraphCast and operational forecast, showing significant forecast skill in the troposphere over lead times from 1 to 10 days. This fine-tuning is accomplished through abbreviating DeepMind's original training curriculum for GraphCast, relying on a shorter single-step forecast stage to accomplish the bulk of the adaptation work and consolidating the autoregressive stages into separate 12hr, 1d, 2d, and 3d stages with larger learning rates. Additionally, training over 3d forecasts is split into two sub-steps to conserve host memory while maintaining a strong correlation with training over the full period.

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial attribute inference attack accuracy.

Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization techniques that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. Key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Accurate annotation of educational resources is crucial for effective personalized learning and resource recommendation in online education. However, fine-grained knowledge labels often overlap or share similarities, making it difficult for existing multi-label classification methods to differentiate them. The label distribution imbalance due to sparsity of human annotations further intensifies these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces RR2QC, a novel Retrieval Reranking method to multi-label Question Classification by leveraging label semantics and meta-label refinement. First, RR2QC improves the pre-training strategy by utilizing semantic relationships within and across label groups. Second, it introduces a class center learning task to align questions with label semantics during downstream training. Finally, this method decomposes labels into meta-labels and uses a meta-label classifier to rerank the retrieved label sequences. In doing so, RR2QC enhances the understanding and prediction capability of long-tail labels by learning from meta-labels that frequently appear in other labels. Additionally, a mathematical LLM is used to generate solutions for questions, extracting latent information to further refine the model's insights. Experimental results show that RR2QC outperforms existing methods in Precision@K and F1 scores across multiple educational datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for online education applications. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/78Erii/RR2QC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), with demonstrated reasoning abilities across multiple domains, are largely underexplored for time-series reasoning (TsR), which is ubiquitous in the real world. In this work, we propose TimerBed, the first comprehensive testbed for evaluating LLMs' TsR performance. Specifically, TimerBed includes stratified reasoning patterns with real-world tasks, comprehensive combinations of LLMs and reasoning strategies, and various supervised models as comparison anchors. We perform extensive experiments with TimerBed, test multiple current beliefs, and verify the initial failures of LLMs in TsR, evidenced by the ineffectiveness of zero shot (ZST) and performance degradation of few shot in-context learning (ICL). Further, we identify one possible root cause: the numerical modeling of data. To address this, we propose a prompt-based solution VL-Time, using visualization-modeled data and language-guided reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Vl-Time enables multimodal LLMs to be non-trivial ZST and powerful ICL reasoners for time series, achieving about 140% average performance improvement and 99% average token costs reduction.

Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.

Abstract: Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.

Abstract: Gaussian graphical model selection is an important paradigm with numerous applications, including biological network modeling, financial network modeling, and social network analysis. Traditional approaches assume access to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address Gaussian graphical model selection under observations from a more realistic dependent stochastic process known as Glauber dynamics. Glauber dynamics, also called the Gibbs sampler, is a Markov chain that sequentially updates the variables of the underlying model based on the statistics of the remaining model. Such models, aside from frequently being employed to generate samples from complex multivariate distributions, naturally arise in various settings, such as opinion consensus in social networks and clearing/stock-price dynamics in financial networks.
  In contrast to the extensive body of existing work, we present the first algorithm for Gaussian graphical model selection when data are sampled according to the Glauber dynamics. We provide theoretical guarantees on the computational and statistical complexity of the proposed algorithm's structure learning performance. Additionally, we provide information-theoretic lower bounds on the statistical complexity and show that our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal for a broad class of problems.

Abstract: Although deep learning models have had great success in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not observe comparable improvements in the case of tabular data, which is still the most common data type used in biological, industrial and financial applications. In particular, it is challenging to transfer large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks defined on small tabular datasets. To address this, we propose VisTabNet -- a cross-modal transfer learning method, which allows for adapting Vision Transformer (ViT) with pre-trained weights to process tabular data. By projecting tabular inputs to patch embeddings acceptable by ViT, we can directly apply a pre-trained Transformer Encoder to tabular inputs. This approach eliminates the conceptual cost of designing a suitable architecture for processing tabular data, while reducing the computational cost of training the model from scratch. Experimental results on multiple small tabular datasets (less than 1k samples) demonstrate VisTabNet's superiority, outperforming both traditional ensemble methods and recent deep learning models. The proposed method goes beyond conventional transfer learning practice and shows that pre-trained image models can be transferred to solve tabular problems, extending the boundaries of transfer learning. We share our example implementation as a GitHub repository available at https://github.com/wwydmanski/VisTabNet.

<title>Dual-Branch HNSW Approach with Skip Bridges and LID-Driven Optimization</title>

Abstract: The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is widely used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, leveraging the principles of navigable small-world graphs. However, it faces some limitations. The first is the local optima problem, which arises from the algorithm's greedy search strategy, selecting neighbors based solely on proximity at each step. This often leads to cluster disconnections. The second limitation is that HNSW frequently fails to achieve logarithmic complexity, particularly in high-dimensional datasets, due to the exhaustive traversal through each layer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that mitigates local optima and cluster disconnections while enhancing the construction speed, maintaining inference speed. The first component is a dual-branch HNSW structure with LID-based insertion mechanisms, enabling traversal from multiple directions. This improves outlier node capture, enhances cluster connectivity, accelerates construction speed and reduces the risk of local minima. The second component incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant intermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on various benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the original HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall improvements of 18\% in NLP, and up to 30\% in CV tasks while reducing the construction time by up to 20\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not observe any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that LID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the dual-branch structure and bridge-building components.

<title>Local Control Networks (LCNs): Optimizing Flexibility in Neural Network Data Pattern Capture</title>

Abstract: The widespread use of Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) often relies on a fixed activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) for all nodes within the hidden layers. While effective in many scenarios, this uniformity may limit the networks ability to capture complex data patterns. We argue that employing the same activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging different activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and adaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs), which leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each node. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the properties and benefits of LCNs over conventional MLPs. In addition, we demonstrate that more complex architectures, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), are unnecessary in certain scenarios, and LCNs can be a more efficient alternative. Empirical experiments on various benchmarks and datasets validate our theoretical findings. In computer vision tasks, LCNs achieve marginal improvements over MLPs and outperform KANs by approximately 5\%, while also being more computationally efficient than KANs. In basic machine learning tasks, LCNs show a 1\% improvement over MLPs and a 0.6\% improvement over KANs. For symbolic formula representation tasks, LCNs perform on par with KANs, with both architectures outperforming MLPs. Our findings suggest that diverse activations at the node level can lead to improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Existing foundation models, such as CLIP, aim to learn a unified embedding space for multimodal data, enabling a wide range of downstream web-based applications like search, recommendation, and content classification. However, these models often overlook the inherent graph structures in multimodal datasets, where entities and their relationships are crucial. Multimodal graphs (MMGs) represent such graphs where each node is associated with features from different modalities, while the edges capture the relationships between these entities. On the other hand, existing graph foundation models primarily focus on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and are not designed to handle the complexities of MMGs. To address these limitations, we propose UniGraph2, a novel cross-domain graph foundation model that enables general representation learning on MMGs, providing a unified embedding space. UniGraph2 employs modality-specific encoders alongside a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a unified low-dimensional embedding space that captures both the multimodal information and the underlying graph structure. We propose a new cross-domain multi-graph pre-training algorithm at scale to ensure effective transfer learning across diverse graph domains and modalities. Additionally, we adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) component to align features from different domains and modalities, ensuring coherent and robust embeddings that unify the information across modalities. Extensive experiments on a variety of multimodal graph tasks demonstrate that UniGraph2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as representation learning, transfer learning, and multimodal generative tasks, offering a scalable and flexible solution for learning on MMGs.

Abstract: In some game scenarios, due to the uncertainty of the number of enemy units and the priority of various attributes, the evaluation of the threat level of enemy units as well as the screening has been a challenging research topic, and the core difficulty lies in how to reasonably set the priority of different attributes in order to achieve quantitative evaluation of the threat. In this paper, we innovatively transform the problem of threat assessment into a reinforcement learning problem, and through systematic reinforcement learning training, we successfully construct an efficient neural network evaluator. The evaluator can not only comprehensively integrate the multidimensional attribute features of the enemy, but also effectively combine our state information, thus realizing a more accurate and scientific threat assessment.

Abstract: Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus making all samples similar and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.

Abstract: Traffic prediction targets forecasting future traffic conditions using historical traffic data, serving a critical role in urban computing and transportation management. To mitigate the scarcity of traffic data while maintaining data privacy, numerous Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT) approaches have been developed, which use transfer learning and federated learning to transfer traffic knowledge from data-rich cities to data-scarce cities, enhancing traffic prediction capabilities for the latter. However, current FTT approaches face challenges such as privacy leakage, cross-city data distribution discrepancies, low data quality, and inefficient knowledge transfer, limiting their privacy protection, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency in real-world applications.
  To this end, we propose FedTT, an effective, efficient, and privacy-aware cross-city traffic knowledge transfer framework that transforms the traffic data domain from the data-rich cities and trains traffic models using the transformed data for the data-scarce cities. First, to safeguard data privacy, we propose a traffic secret transmission method that securely transmits and aggregates traffic domain-transformed data from source cities using a lightweight secret aggregation approach. Second, to mitigate the impact of traffic data distribution discrepancies on model performance, we introduce a traffic domain adapter to uniformly transform traffic data from the source cities' domains to that of the target city. Third, to improve traffic data quality, we design a traffic view imputation method to fill in and predict missing traffic data. Finally, to enhance transfer efficiency, FedTT is equipped with a federated parallel training method that enables the simultaneous training of multiple modules. Extensive experiments using 4 real-life datasets demonstrate that FedTT outperforms the 14 state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: In various game scenarios, selecting a fixed number of targets from multiple enemy units is an extremely challenging task. This difficulty stems from the complex relationship between the threat levels of enemy units and their feature characteristics, which complicates the design of rule-based evaluators. Moreover, traditional supervised learning methods face the challenge of lacking explicit labels during training when applied to this threat evaluation problem. In this study, we redefine the threat evaluation problem as a reinforcement learning task and introduce an efficient evaluator training algorithm, Eval-PPO, based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Eval-PPO integrates multidimensional enemy features and the state information of friendly units through systematic training, thereby achieving precise threat assessment. Compared with rule-based methods, Eval-PPO demonstrates a significant improvement in average success rate, with an increase of 17.84%.

Abstract: The linear regression (LR) method offers the advantage that optimal parameters can be calculated relatively easily, although its representation capability is limited than that of the deep learning technique. To improve deep reinforcement learning, the Least Squares Deep Q Network (LS-DQN) method was proposed by Levine et al., which combines Deep Q Network (DQN) with LR method. However, the LS-DQN method assumes that the actions are discrete. In this study, we propose the Double Least Squares Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DLS-DDPG) method to address this limitation. This method combines the LR method with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique, one of the representative deep reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action cases. For the LR update of the critic network, DLS-DDPG uses an algorithm similar to the Fitted Q iteration, the method which LS-DQN adopted. In addition, we calculated the optimal action using the quasi-Newton method and used it as both the agent's action and the training data for the LR update of the actor network. Numerical experiments conducted in MuJoCo environments showed that the proposed method improved performance at least in some tasks, although there are difficulties such as the inability to make the regularization terms small.

Abstract: The Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model has been widely applied in survival analysis to estimate relative risks across different subjects given multiple covariates. Traditional CPH models rely on a linear combination of covariates weighted with coefficients as the log-risk function, which imposes a strong and restrictive assumption, limiting generalization. Recent deep learning methods enable non-linear log-risk functions. However, they often lack interpretability due to the end-to-end training mechanisms. The implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offers new possibilities for extending the CPH model with fully transparent and symbolic non-linear log-risk functions. In this paper, we introduce Generalized Cox Proportional Hazards (GCPH) model, a novel method for survival analysis that leverages KAN to enable a non-linear mapping from covariates to survival outcomes in a fully symbolic manner. GCPH maintains the interpretability of traditional CPH models while allowing for the estimation of non-linear log-risk functions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and various public benchmarks demonstrate that GCPH achieves competitive performance in terms of prediction accuracy and exhibits superior interpretability compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships. The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras .h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting accountability.

Abstract: This paper integrates deep neural networks (DNNs) into structural economic models to increase flexibility and capture rich heterogeneity while preserving interpretability. Economic structure and machine learning are complements in empirical modeling, not substitutes: DNNs provide the capacity to learn complex, non-linear heterogeneity patterns, while the structural model ensures the estimates remain interpretable and suitable for decision making and policy analysis. We start with a standard parametric structural model and then enrich its parameters into fully flexible functions of observables, which are estimated using a particular DNN architecture whose structure reflects the economic model. We illustrate our framework by studying demand estimation in consumer choice. We show that by enriching a standard demand model we can capture rich heterogeneity, and further, exploit this heterogeneity to create a personalized pricing strategy. This type of optimization is not possible without economic structure, but cannot be heterogeneous without machine learning. Finally, we provide theoretical justification of each step in our proposed methodology. We first establish non-asymptotic bounds and convergence rates of our structural deep learning approach. Next, a novel and quite general influence function calculation allows for feasible inference via double machine learning in a wide variety of contexts. These results may be of interest in many other contexts, as they generalize prior work.

Abstract: Civilizations have tried to make drinking water safe to consume for thousands of years. The process of determining water contaminants has evolved with the complexity of the contaminants due to pesticides and heavy metals. The routine procedure to determine water safety is to use targeted analysis which searches for specific substances from some known list; however, we do not explicitly know which substances should be on this list. Before experimentally determining which substances are contaminants, how do we answer the sampling problem of identifying all the substances in the water? Here, we present an approach that builds on the work of Jaanus Liigand et al., which used non-targeted analysis that conducts a broader search on the sample to develop a random-forest regression model, to predict the names of all the substances in a sample, as well as their respective concentrations[1]. This work utilizes techniques from dimensionality reduction and linear decompositions to present a more accurate model using data from the European Massbank Metabolome Library to produce a global list of chemicals that researchers can then identify and test for when purifying water.

Abstract: The Koopman operator serves as the theoretical backbone for machine learning of dynamical control systems, where the operator is heuristically approximated by extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). In this paper, we propose SafEDMD, a novel stability- and certificate-oriented EDMD-based controller design framework. Our approach leverages a reliable surrogate model generated in a data-driven fashion in order to provide closed-loop guarantees. In particular, we establish a controller design based on semi-definite programming with guaranteed stabilization of the underlying nonlinear system. As central ingredient, we derive proportional error bounds that vanish at the origin and are tailored to control tasks. We illustrate the developed method by means of several benchmark examples and highlight the advantages over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of Bayesian fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) in structured bandits. We propose an algorithm that uses fixed allocations based on the prior information and the structure of the environment. We provide theoretical bounds on its performance across diverse models, including the first prior-dependent upper bounds for linear and hierarchical BAI. Our key contribution is introducing new proof methods that result in tighter bounds for multi-armed BAI compared to existing methods. We extensively compare our approach to other fixed-budget BAI methods, demonstrating its consistent and robust performance in various settings. Our work improves our understanding of Bayesian fixed-budget BAI in structured bandits and highlights the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper studies the $p$-biharmonic equation on graphs, which arises in point cloud processing and can be interpreted as a natural extension of the graph $p$-Laplacian from the perspective of hypergraph. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is investigated when the random geometric graph is considered and the number of data points goes to infinity. We show that the continuum limit is an appropriately weighted $p$-biharmonic equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The result relies on the uniform $L^p$ estimates for solutions and gradients of nonlocal and graph Poisson equations. The $L^\infty$ estimates of solutions are also obtained as a byproduct.

Abstract: We propose a general method for constructing robust permutation tests under data corruption. The proposed tests effectively control the non-asymptotic type I error under data corruption, and we prove their consistency in power under minimal conditions. This contributes to the practical deployment of hypothesis tests for real-world applications with potential adversarial attacks. For the two-sample and independence settings, we show that our kernel robust tests are minimax optimal, in the sense that they are guaranteed to be non-asymptotically powerful against alternatives uniformly separated from the null in the kernel MMD and HSIC metrics at some optimal rate (tight with matching lower bound). We point out that existing differentially private tests can be adapted to be robust to data corruption, and we demonstrate in experiments that our proposed tests achieve much higher power than these private tests. Finally, we provide publicly available implementations and empirically illustrate the practicality of our robust tests.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage active learning (AL) pipeline for automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining unsupervised and supervised AL methods. The first stage utilizes unsupervised AL by using x-vectors clustering for diverse sample selection from unlabeled speech data, thus establishing a robust initial dataset for the subsequent supervised AL. The second stage incorporates a supervised AL strategy, with a batch AL method specifically developed for ASR, aimed at selecting diverse and informative batches of samples. Here, sample diversity is also achieved using x-vectors clustering, while the most informative samples are identified using a Bayesian AL method tailored for ASR with an adaptation of Monte Carlo dropout to approximate Bayesian inference. This approach enables precise uncertainty estimation, thereby enhancing ASR model training with significantly reduced data requirements. Our method has shown superior performance compared to competing methods on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and OOD test sets, demonstrating that strategic sample selection and innovative Bayesian modeling can substantially optimize both labeling effort and data utilization in deep learning-based ASR applications.

Abstract: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.

Abstract: This work is concerned with conformal prediction in contemporary applications (including generative AI) where a black-box model has been trained on data that are not accessible to the user. Mirroring split-conformal inference, we design a wrapper around a black-box algorithm which calibrates conformity scores. This calibration is local and proceeds in two stages by first adaptively partitioning the predictor space into groups and then calibrating sectionally group by group. Adaptive partitioning (self-grouping) is achieved by fitting a robust regression tree to the conformity scores on the calibration set. This new tree variant is designed in such a way that adding a single new observation does not change the tree fit with overwhelmingly large probability. This add-one-in robustness property allows us to conclude a finite sample group-conditional coverage guarantee, a refinement of the marginal guarantee. In addition, unlike traditional split-conformal inference, adaptive splitting and within-group calibration yields adaptive bands which can stretch and shrink locally. We demonstrate benefits of local tightening on several simulated as well as real examples using non-parametric regression. Finally, we consider two contemporary classification applications for obtaining uncertainty quantification around GPT-4o predictions. We conformalize skin disease diagnoses based on self-reported symptoms as well as predicted states of U.S. legislators based on summaries of their ideology. We demonstrate substantial local tightening of the uncertainty sets while attaining similar marginal coverage.

<title>Efficient Budget Allocation for Large-Scale LLM-Enabled Virtual Screening</title>

Abstract: Screening tasks that aim to identify a small subset of top alternatives from a large pool are common in business decision-making processes. These tasks often require substantial human effort to evaluate each alternative's performance, making them time-consuming and costly. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their ability to generate outputs that align well with human evaluations, we consider an LLM-as-human-evaluator approach for conducting screening virtually, thereby reducing the cost burden. To achieve scalability and cost-effectiveness in virtual screening, we identify that the stochastic nature of LLM outputs and their cost structure necessitate efficient budget allocation across all alternatives. To address this, we propose using a top-$m$ greedy evaluation mechanism, a simple yet effective approach that keeps evaluating the current top-$m$ alternatives, and design the explore-first top-$m$ greedy (EFG-$m$) algorithm. We prove that EFG-$m$ is both sample-optimal and consistent in large-scale virtual screening. Surprisingly, we also uncover a bonus ranking effect, where the algorithm naturally induces an indifference-based ranking within the selected subset. To further enhance practicality, we design a suite of algorithm variants to improve screening performance and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments validate our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. Lastly, we conduct a case study on LLM-based virtual screening. The study shows that while LLMs alone may not provide meaningful screening and ranking results when directly queried, integrating them with our sample-optimal algorithms unlocks their potential for cost-effective, large-scale virtual screening.

Abstract: The proliferation of various data sources in urban and territorial environments has significantly facilitated the development of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) across a wide range of geospatial applications. However, geospatial data, which is inherently linked to geospatial objects, often exhibits data heterogeneity that necessitates specialized fusion and representation strategies while simultaneously being inherently sparse in labels for downstream tasks. Consequently, there is a growing demand for techniques that can effectively leverage geospatial data without heavy reliance on task-specific labels and model designs. This need aligns with the principles of self-supervised learning (SSL), which has garnered increasing attention for its ability to learn effective and generalizable representations directly from data without extensive labeled supervision. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SSL techniques specifically applied to or developed for geospatial objects in three primary vector geometric types: Point, Polyline, and Polygon. We systematically categorize various SSL techniques into predictive and contrastive methods, and analyze their adaptation to different data types for representation learning across various downstream tasks. Furthermore, we examine the emerging trends in SSL for geospatial objects, particularly the gradual advancements towards geospatial foundation models. Finally, we discuss key challenges in current research and outline promising directions for future investigation. By offering a structured analysis of existing studies, this paper aims to inspire continued progress in integrating SSL with geospatial objects, and the development of geospatial foundation models in a longer term.

Abstract: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its effects on the learned policy remain inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity to unexpected states. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop adaptation. At each timestep, BID samples multiple candidate predictions and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes both long-term consistency and short-term reactivity. Experimental results show that our method boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.

Abstract: Estimating out-of-sample risk for models trained on large high-dimensional datasets is an expensive but essential part of the machine learning process, enabling practitioners to optimally tune hyperparameters. Cross-validation (CV) serves as the de facto standard for risk estimation but poorly trades off high bias ($K$-fold CV) for computational cost (leave-one-out CV). We propose a randomized approximate leave-one-out (RandALO) risk estimator that is not only a consistent estimator of risk in high dimensions but also less computationally expensive than $K$-fold CV. We support our claims with extensive simulations on synthetic and real data and provide a user-friendly Python package implementing RandALO available on PyPI as randalo and at https://github.com/cvxgrp/randalo.

Abstract: Large Language Model can reasonably understand and generate human expressions but may lack of thorough thinking and reasoning mechanisms. Recently there have been several studies which enhance the thinking ability of language models but most of them are not data-driven or training-based. In this paper, we are motivated by the cognitive mechanism in the natural world, and design a novel model architecture called TaS which allows it to first consider the thoughts and then express the response based upon the query. We design several pipelines to annotate or generate the thought contents from prompt-response samples, then add language heads in a middle layer which behaves as the thinking layer. We train the language model by the thoughts-augmented data and successfully let the thinking layer automatically generate reasonable thoughts and finally output more reasonable responses. Both qualitative examples and quantitative results validate the effectiveness and performance of TaS. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TadE.

Abstract: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.

<title>Inferring Thunderstorm Occurrence from Vertical Profiles of Convection-Permitting Simulations: Physical Insights from a Physical Deep Learning Model</title>

Abstract: Thunderstorms have significant social and economic impacts due to heavy precipitation, hail, lightning, and strong winds, necessitating reliable forecasts. Thunderstorm forecasts based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) often rely on single-level surrogate predictors, like convective available potential energy and convective inhibition, derived from vertical profiles of three-dimensional atmospheric variables. In this study, we develop SALAMA 1D, a deep neural network which directly infers the probability of thunderstorm occurrence from vertical profiles of ten atmospheric variables, bypassing single-level predictors. By training the model on convection-permitting NWP forecasts, we allow SALAMA 1D to flexibly identify convective patterns, with the goal of enhancing forecast accuracy. The model's architecture is physically motivated: sparse connections encourage interactions at similar height levels while keeping model size and inference times computationally efficient, whereas a shuffling mechanism prevents the model from learning non-physical patterns tied to the vertical grid. SALAMA 1D is trained over Central Europe with lightning observations as the ground truth. Comparative analysis against a baseline machine learning model that uses single-level predictors shows SALAMA 1D's superior skill across various metrics and lead times of up to at least 11 hours. Moreover, expanding the archive of forecasts from which training examples are sampled improves skill, even when training set size remains constant. Finally, a sensitivity analysis using saliency maps indicates that our model relies on physically interpretable patterns consistent with established theoretical understanding, such as ice particle content near the tropopause, cloud cover, conditional instability, and low-level moisture.

Abstract: Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improved faithfulness.Project is available at: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FaithEval.

Abstract: Following the impressive capabilities of in-context learning with large transformers, In-Context Imitation Learning (ICIL) is a promising opportunity for robotics. We introduce Instant Policy, which learns new tasks instantly (without further training) from just one or two demonstrations, achieving ICIL through two key components. First, we introduce inductive biases through a graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem with a learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations, observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained using pseudo-demonstrations - arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation - as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Simulated and real experiments show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks. Code and videos are available at https://www.robot-learning.uk/instant-policy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel operator-theoretic approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the infinitesimal generator of a controlled stochastic diffusion in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. We demonstrate that our approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problems. Furthermore, our learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

<title>An Adaptive Grasping Force Tracking Strategy for Nonlinear and Time-Varying Object Behaviors</title>

Abstract: Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous, plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear, and time-varying grasp systems, demonstrating the generalization capability of our neural network and enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.

Abstract: This paper explores the robustness of language models (LMs) to variations in the temporal context within factual knowledge. It examines whether LMs can correctly associate a temporal context with a past fact valid over a defined period, by asking them to differentiate correct from incorrect contexts. The accuracy of LMs is analyzed along two dimensions: the distance of the incorrect context from the validity period and the granularity of the context. To this end, a dataset called TimeStress is introduced, enabling the evaluation of 18 diverse LMs. Results reveal that the best LM achieves perfect accuracy for only 6% of the studied facts, with critical errors that humans would not make. This work highlights the limitations of current LMs in temporal representation. We provide all data and code for further research.

arXiv:2502.15654v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the characteristics of text at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present. We release our code at https://github.com/GeorgeDrayson/model_collapse.

Abstract: Many contact-rich tasks humans perform, such as box pickup or rolling dough, rely on force feedback for reliable execution. However, this force information, which is readily available in most robot arms, is not commonly used in teleoperation and policy learning. Consequently, robot behavior is often limited to quasi-static kinematic tasks that do not require intricate force-feedback. In this paper, we first present a low-cost, intuitive, bilateral teleoperation setup that relays external forces of the follower arm back to the teacher arm, facilitating data collection for complex, contact-rich tasks. We then introduce FACTR, a policy learning method that employs a curriculum which corrupts the visual input with decreasing intensity throughout training. The curriculum prevents our transformer-based policy from over-fitting to the visual input and guides the policy to properly attend to the force modality. We demonstrate that by fully utilizing the force information, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen objects by 43\% compared to baseline approaches without a curriculum.

<title>Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies</title>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

Abstract: Road rage, driven by emotional outbursts, endangers road and public safety. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can detect early negative emotions to reduce accidents, but traditional methods (e.g., HMMs, LSTMs) using 1D speech signals face overfitting and miscalibration issues. This paper proposes a risk management framework ensuring statistically rigorous correctness coverage for test data. We separate a calibration set, design a binary loss function to check if ground-truth labels are in prediction sets, calibrated by data-driven threshold $\lambda$. A joint loss function on the calibration set adjusts $\lambda$ according to user-specified risk level $\alpha$, bounding the test loss expectation by $\alpha$. Evaluations on 6 models across 2 datasets show our framework strictly maintains average correctness coverage $\geq 1-\alpha$ and controls marginal error rates under various calibration-test splits (e.g., 0.1). Additionally, a small-batch online calibration framework based on local exchangeability is proposed for complex scenarios with data domain offset or non-IID batches. By constructing a non-negative test martingale, it ensures prediction set coverage in dynamic environments, validated via cross-dataset experiments.

Abstract: With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based methodology for in-situ weather forecast postprocessing that is both spatially coherent and multivariate. Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.

<title>Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods.

Abstract: Multiscale problems are ubiquitous in physics. Numerical simulations of such problems by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at high resolution are computationally too expensive for many-query scenarios, e.g., uncertainty quantification, remeshing applications, topology optimization, and so forth. This limitation has motivated the application of data-driven surrogate models, where the microscale computations are $\textit{substituted}$ with a surrogate, usually acting as a black-box mapping between macroscale quantities. These models offer significant speedups but struggle with incorporating microscale physical constraints, such as the balance of linear momentum and constitutive models. In this contribution, we propose Equilibrium Neural Operator (EquiNO) as a $\textit{complementary}$ physics-informed PDE surrogate for predicting microscale physics and compare it with variational physics-informed neural and operator networks. Our framework, applicable to the so-called multiscale FE$^{\,2}\,$ computations, introduces the FE-OL approach by integrating the finite element (FE) method with operator learning (OL). We apply the proposed FE-OL approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics. The results demonstrate that FE-OL can yield accurate solutions even when confronted with a restricted dataset during model development. Our results show that EquiNO achieves speedup factors exceeding 8000-fold compared to traditional methods and offers an optimal balance between data-driven and physics-based strategies.

Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on enhancing the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) by integrating multiple inferred networks. It utilizes autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns and prior knowledge from GRN structures through random walks and BERT encoding. Positional encodings of input gene networks are also considered to better identify gene positions within the graph. These embeddings are then combined in a graph transformer-based model called GT-GRN for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively leverages the topological structure of the ground truth network and the enriched encoded information, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. <div>

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Backslash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

This article introduces a new data-centric pretraining framework for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate the risk of generating harmful or toxic content. Key contributions include a safety classifier trained on 10,000 labeled examples, a synthetic safety dataset of 100B tokens created by recontextualizing harmful web data, RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets for converting harmful prompts, injecting Harmfulness-Tag annotations during pretraining to flag unsafe content, and safety evaluations to measure base model behavior. The safety-pretrained models successfully reduce attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% without sacrificing performance on LLM safety benchmarks. This approach addresses the challenge of removing unsafe patterns learned during pretraining by incorporating safety measures from the start, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to generate safe and responsible content.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. We present a data-centric pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled examples, used to filter 600B tokens; (ii) the largest synthetic safety dataset to date (100B tokens) generated via recontextualization of harmful web data; (iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag annotations injected during pretraining to flag unsafe content and steer away inference from harmful generations; and (v) safety evaluations measuring base model behavior before instruction tuning. Our safety-pretrained models reduce attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% with no performance degradation on standard LLM safety benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
The article explores the possibility of automated hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical framework. It establishes a connection between hallucination detection and language identification, suggesting the difficulty of detecting hallucinations from correct statements alone. However, with the inclusion of expert-labeled feedback – training the detector with both correct and incorrect examples – automated hallucination detection becomes feasible for all countable language collections. This emphasizes the importance of expert-labeled examples in training detectors and supports feedback-based methods like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for reliable LLM deployment. <div>
arXiv:2504.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field reconstruction is crucial in many applications, including antenna diagnostics, electromagnetic interference analysis, and system modeling. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for Far-Field to Near-Field (FF-NF) transformation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to reconstruct near-field distributions from the far-field data of an antenna without relying on explicit analytical transformations. The CNNs are trained on paired far-field and near-field data and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). The best model achieves a training error of 0.0199 and a test error of 0.3898. Moreover, visual comparisons between the predicted and true near-field distributions demonstrate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex electromagnetic field behavior, highlighting the potential of deep learning in electromagnetic field reconstruction.

<br />
Summary: Fairness-aware learning strives to reduce discrimination in machine learning models while maintaining predictive accuracy. The study investigates how data sampling during training and testing can impact fairness metrics, suggesting that bias in training data may persist in test data. To address this issue, the FairMatch method is proposed, which applies propensity score matching to assess and alleviate bias. By identifying similar pairs within subgroups and adjusting decision thresholds accordingly, FairMatch effectively reduces bias in test data. For unmatched samples, probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions is utilized. Experimental results show that FairMatch accurately identifies unbiased subsets and significantly mitigates bias in the remaining data, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving fairness evaluation and mitigation without sacrificing predictive performance. <div>

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

<title>In-Context Learning can distort the relationship between sequence likelihoods and biological fitness</title>

<div> Keywords: Language models, biological sequences, grammar rules, likelihood scores, transformer-based models

Summary:
Language models are being used to predict the viability of biological sequences by learning grammar rules during training. However, in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores, particularly leading to anomalously high scores for sequences with repeated motifs. This effect is most pronounced in transformer-based models, where a look-up operation using repeated motifs as reference can override learned priors. This phenomenon extends to imperfectly repeated sequences and other biologically relevant features like reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences. The study highlights the potential limitations and biases that can arise in the application of language models to biological data, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and validation of model predictions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein language models with different architectures trained on the masked language modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold into hairpin structures.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems, radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity, and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from 411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and clarity.

Summary: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas properties are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle. Retrieving these properties from observations is a complex non-linear Bayesian inverse problem currently solved using the computationally expensive Optimal Estimation algorithm. However, this approach leads to convergence issues and unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates. To address this, a diffusion-based approach is proposed for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, allowing for flexible retrieval of Gaussian or non-Gaussian posteriors with a significant speed-up in computation. Developing fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is essential for upcoming satellite missions, aiming to enable near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks for effective policy-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning models in financial analytics.

arXiv:2504.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

The paper introduces the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI) as a tool for monitoring Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training dynamics and identifying optimal regularization hyperparameters. OUI helps in guiding the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training without validation data. Through experiments on various DNN architectures and datasets, the study shows that maintaining OUI within a specific range leads to improved generalization and validation scores. OUI converges faster than traditional metrics like loss or accuracy, enabling early identification of optimal WD values. By using OUI as a reliable indicator, practitioners can tune WD values more precisely for enhanced performance. The code for reproducing the experiments is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K, we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy, enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these experiments is available at https://github.com/AlbertoFdezHdez/OUI.

Summary: 
Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI) addresses the issue of missing traffic speed data in intelligent transportation systems by combining the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function. This approach improves accuracy and robustness in imputing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI utilizes a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach for efficient nonnegative latent factor analysis on a tensor. Empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that TATSI outperforms existing traffic speed predictors by capturing temporal patterns more accurately and providing the most precise imputations for missing traffic speed data. <div>
arXiv:2504.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data. Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function, thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

arXiv:2504.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Summary: 
NeuralGrok introduces a novel gradient-based approach to enhance generalization in transformers for arithmetic tasks. By training an auxiliary module in conjunction with the base model, NeuralGrok dynamically modulates gradient components to accelerate generalization. This approach significantly speeds up the generalization process, particularly in challenging tasks, offering a more stable training paradigm compared to traditional regularization methods like weight decay. The Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric is used to measure and reduce model complexity, showing that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by simplifying the model.

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing generalization ability.

Summary:
The study focuses on the generalization of downsampling layers for group equivariant architectures, like G-CNNs, on finite groups with anti-aliasing. The algorithm devised can create a suitable subgroup for a given finite group and downsampling rate. The concept of bandlimited-ness is explored concerning groups and subgroups, suggesting methods for anti-aliasing. This approach extends classical sampling theory to downsampling. For signals on cyclic groups, the method mimics traditional downsampling with an ideal low-pass filter before subsampling. Experimental results in image classification tasks illustrate that implementing the proposed downsampling operation enhances accuracy, better retains equivariance, and reduces model size in G-equivariant networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner. Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

Summary: 
The article discusses recovering latent information from graphs under epsilon-edge local differential privacy constraints where relationships between vertices are kept confidential. It focuses on generalized random dot-product graphs and shows that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces geometric distortion in latent positions. By adjusting the statistical inference procedure for privatized graphs, consistent recovery of latent positions is possible. The procedure is proven to be nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints. Additionally, the framework allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information encoded in the persistence diagrams of the latent positions. This work expands on previous research in private community detection to a broader range of models and inferential tasks. <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under $\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

<div> Keywords: Graph Neural Networks, structural imbalance, graph heterophily, HeRB, homophilic knowledge transfer

Summary:<br />
Recent research has focused on the challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in dealing with structural imbalance. Prior solutions did not consider graph heterophily, where connected nodes have distinct labels or features, leading to reduced effectiveness. To address this, a new method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) is proposed. HeRB includes a heterophily-lessening module to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges, and a homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism. Experimental results show that HeRB outperforms existing methods on various benchmark datasets, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its components. This approach improves the performance of GNNs by addressing the issue of structural imbalance while considering graph heterophily. <div>

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets, and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed components.

Summary: 
The paper presents a novel method, ExOSITO, for ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the ICU. It combines off-policy learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of lab tests to order, considering both observed and predicted patient status. The approach uses a causal bandit framework trained on offline data and a reward function based on clinically-approved rules. By integrating clinical knowledge with observational data, ExOSITO provides an interpretable tool for clinicians to order lab tests, reducing costs without omitting important orders. The learned policy outperforms a physician's policy and previous methods, addressing the challenge of balancing information availability and clinical burden in lab test ordering. <div>
arXiv:2504.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO) creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior approaches to this practical problem.

<div> Triggers, Text classifiers, Backdoor attacks, Human evaluation, Subtlety<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on backdoor attacks on text classifiers that manipulate predictions by inserting triggers. Unlike previous attacks that use easily detectable triggers, the new approach aims for subtlety to evade human detection. Through human evaluations, the authors introduce AttrBkd, which utilizes refined trigger attributes for more effective and inconspicuous attacks. Results show that AttrBkd outperforms baseline attacks in both success rate and subtlety. Human annotation reveals discrepancies with automated metrics, emphasizing the importance of human judgment in evaluating attack strategies. This research highlights the potential for backdoor attacks to bypass detection by blending in naturally with legitimate text, showcasing the need for enhanced defense mechanisms against subtle adversarial threats.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks, demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning (ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Summary: 
This article addresses the challenge of spurious correlations in predictive models, which can lead to correct predictions for the wrong reasons. The existing approach of maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy requires expensive bias annotations, making it impractical for resource-limited domains. The proposed method reframes spurious correlations as imbalances in class-conditional distributions, offering a simple yet effective solution that eliminates the need for bias annotations or predictions. By leveraging a sample reweighting strategy to balance class-conditional distributions, the method reduces the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, effectively dismantling spurious correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization. Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations. To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance across a range of datasets.

<div> Keywords: social learning, adaptive, online setting, belief update, stochastic gradient descent

Summary:
The article discusses a new strategy called A^2SL for social learning in a dynamic environment. The strategy involves two adaptation stages: stochastic gradient descent to track decision model drifts and adaptive belief updates for changing hypotheses. By controlling adaptation parameters, all agents consistently learn and focus their beliefs on the true hypothesis. The probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values determined by the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is supported by experiments on synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effectiveness of A^2SL in online social learning scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs) to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy, which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$ strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper, we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques, where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

The article introduces CHASe, a Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection method designed for Federated Active Learning (FAL). CHASe focuses on identifying unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations to improve data selection efficiency.

Experimental results demonstrate CHASe's superiority in effectiveness and efficiency compared to established baselines across diverse datasets and federation settings. <div>
arXiv:2504.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling. Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

<div> Keywords: pretrained language models, multi-tenant environments, hierarchical knowledge management, resource-efficient, GPU memory usage

Summary:
The article introduces HMI, a system designed to efficiently serve multiple tenants with distinct pretrained language models (PLMs). By categorizing PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific, hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) are formed to reduce GPU memory usage per tenant. Hierarchical knowledge management is implemented for hPLMs from different tenants, utilizing domain-specific knowledge trees and task-specific knowledge through parameter swapping. System optimizations, such as hierarchical knowledge prefetching and batched matrix multiplications, enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. Experimental results show that HMI can effectively handle up to 10,000 hPLMs on a single GPU with minimal accuracy compromise.

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs), which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

<br /><br />Summary: Climate change impacts urban infrastructure, particularly Combined Sewer Systems (CSS), motivating the exploration of Machine Learning (ML) for forecasting. A protocol evaluates Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting, considering performance, complexity, and resilience.

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.

<div> dynamic graphs, gossip learning, Byzantine attacks, robust learning, peer sampling

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of Byzantine nodes.
- GRANITE utilizes a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS) to track adversarial influence over time.
- An Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT) is used to set aggregation thresholds based on estimates of Byzantine presence.
- Empirical results show that GRANITE can maintain convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes and improve learning speed by filtering poisoned models adaptively.
- GRANITE achieves these results in graphs up to 9 times sparser than current theory allows. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.

Summary: 
The article introduces Plasticine, a novel open-source framework designed to address plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Plasticity loss refers to the phenomenon where neural networks gradually lose their ability to adapt during training. The framework provides single-file implementations of 13 different mitigation methods, 10 evaluation metrics, and various learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity levels, ranging from standard to open-ended environments. Plasticine aims to fill the gap in the field by offering a unified benchmarking platform for researchers to quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts.

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general intelligence. However, deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems often suffer from plasticity loss, where neural networks gradually lose their ability to adapt during training. Despite its significance, this field lacks unified benchmarks and evaluation protocols. We introduce Plasticine, the first open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL. Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods, 10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity levels from standard to open-ended environments. This framework enables researchers to systematically quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts.

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here, we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in some metrics.

Traditional time-series forecasting methods often focus solely on minimizing prediction errors without considering the specific needs of real-world applications. This paper introduces a new training approach that allows forecasting models to adapt their focus based on the importance of specified forecast ranges by breaking down predictions into smaller segments. These segments are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce more accurate forecasts. Testing on standard datasets, including a new wireless communication dataset, demonstrated improved prediction accuracy and enhanced overall performance of end applications utilizing the forecasting model.

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology, which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Summary:<br />Reservoir computers (RCs) are analyzed in terms of nonlinearity in input data and optimal design. The study focuses on aligning reservoir nonlinearity with data nonlinearity for improved predictive performance. Experiments using the fractional Halvorsen system show that matching reservoir nonlinearity to data nonlinearity maximizes prediction accuracy. When multiple nonlinearities are present in data, matching the smallest nonlinearity results in correct signal reconstruction. A method is proposed for estimating minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by tuning reservoir exponent until successful reconstruction. This method is applied to synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, demonstrating practicality. Enhancing traditional RC architectures with fractional reservoir states improves performance, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. This research offers a systematic approach to tailor RCs for modeling the complexity of target systems.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model.

Summary: 
The article introduces the idea of Distributed Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (DSLTH) to address the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning. The proposed algorithm involves representing local models as a combination of global parameters and personalized binary masks for pruning. Real-valued parameters are kept constant among agents, while personalized binary masks are updated and fused during learning. A group sparse regularization term is incorporated to achieve structured sparsity and simplify hardware implementation. The algorithm includes a binary mask aggregation process with personalized fine-tuning to align model updates with local data distribution. The theoretical proof for DSLTH is provided, highlighting its importance in the proposed method. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in leveraging agent relationships and meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. <div>

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<div> Cooperative Task Offloading, Edge Computing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Transformer-driven Prediction, Latency Reduction <br />
Summary: <br />
Future networks, including 6G, are expected to enable the Internet of Everything, leading to increased demand for computing resources. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers a solution by offloading tasks to nearby servers, reducing latency and energy consumption. However, relying on a single MEC server can result in uneven resource usage and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, a Cooperative Task Offloading framework with Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP) is proposed. This framework leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for asynchronous training, optimizing task offloading and resource allocation across distributed networks. The CTO-TP algorithm significantly reduces system latency by up to 80% and energy consumption by 87% compared to baseline strategies. <div>

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87% energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

arXiv:2504.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL) training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained, client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable performance in practice.

Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the issue of limited generalization in learning-based autonomous driving systems. It highlights the need for models that can handle a wide range of road scenarios and accommodate various traffic conditions. The research focuses on designing feature spaces for neural network-based motion planners that can effectively capture diverse road structures and topologies. By employing graph representations of road networks and multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques, the study demonstrates a method to obtain feature spaces that enable generalized learning. The analysis also explores the potential benefits of embedding graph nodes for simplifying learning processes and achieving dimensionality reduction in autonomous driving applications. By leveraging cutting-edge graph representation methods and MDS approaches, the research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous driving technology and improving the adaptability and performance of self-driving vehicles.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Summary:
Machine and deep learning methods were evaluated in comparison to penalized Cox models for survival analysis. The study examined their performance on synthetic and real datasets, testing eight different models including non-linear and non-proportional hazards models. The use of Antolini's concordance index and Brier's score was highlighted as important measures for assessing method performance. Results suggested that the performance of machine and deep learning models may have been underestimated, and the selection of the most appropriate method should consider sample size, non-linearity, and non-proportional hazards conditions. The study emphasized the importance of testing multiple methods to determine the best approach for survival prediction. The code and documentation are available for easy reproducibility of the tests on the benchmark data. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets. In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size, non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/compbiomed-unito/survhive.

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline) from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network, which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted. These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and industry.

<title>TarDiff: Target-Oriented Diffusion Guidance for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17613</link>

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS, the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DROCKS-7FF3/README.md.

<title>The effects of Hessian eigenvalue spectral density type on the applicability of Hessian analysis to generalization capability assessment of neural networks</title>

arXiv:2504.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology. Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues and NN loss landscape curvature.

<title>PTCL: Pseudo-Label Temporal Curriculum Learning for Label-Limited Dynamic Graph</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets. The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.

<title>Aerial Image Classification in Scarce and Unconstrained Environments via Conformal Prediction</title>

arXiv:2504.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

<title>Fault Diagnosis in New Wind Turbines using Knowledge from Existing Turbines by Generative Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at \https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty. Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only between different models but also across categories within the same task and between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to compare and select models based on application-specific robustness requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, with speech impairments among its earliest symptoms. Speech impairments offer a valuable diagnostic opportunity, with machine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In this research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's disease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal segments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks to associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a basis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing 831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability by identifying key speech features influencing predictions.

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions. Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/jiangmingchen/HOTET.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation, forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their flexibility.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.

<title>Engineering the Law-Machine Learning Translation Problem: Developing Legally Aligned Models</title>

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require "indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations. Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning, imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

<title>Neural Contraction Metrics with Formal Guarantees for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the context of explainable machine learning.

<title>PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information Differential Games</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine. While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects, facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE estimation, supporting precision medicine.

<title>Lessons from Deploying Learning-based CSI Localization on a Large-Scale ISAC Platform</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the "long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.

Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl, all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy. To further enhance performance, we apply transfer learning using MarianNMT pre-trained models within the SimpleTransformers framework. Our RNN-based system achieves competitive results, closely matching existing English-Igbo benchmarks. With transfer learning, we observe a performance gain of +4.83 BLEU points, reaching an estimated translation accuracy of 70%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining RNNs with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language translation tasks.

Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series foundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall, UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space, providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and conservation.

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI capabilities but pose considerable challenges for deployment on edge devices due to high computational demands, memory bandwidth constraints, and energy consumption. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) with FPGA-accelerated execution pipelines, the proposed approach enhances both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second.

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training, and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management and understanding complex environmental interactions.

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72% and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially aiding healthcare providers in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<title>An introduction to R package `mvs`</title>

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking (MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive. Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs` makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and provides several options for missing data handling.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

<title>When Does Metadata Conditioning (NOT) Work for Language Model Pre-Training? A Study with Context-Free Grammars</title>

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN) for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of 0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE}, based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric distribution learning in generative modeling.

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as "deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or "MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200 "nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining these gaps.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as $1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding. For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$, the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1) continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations. However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline, suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration, their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at https://github.com/matthjs/xai-gp.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases, including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants. However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource (memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm, EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

Abstract: Sparse attention offers a promising strategy to extend long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, yet its viability, its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and systematic scaling studies remain unexplored. To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition, we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound separation in natural audio scenarios.

Abstract: Many economies are challenged by the effects of an ageing population, particularly in sectors where resource capacity planning is critical, such as healthcare. This research addresses the operational challenges of bed and staffing capacity planning in hospital wards by using predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both individually and in tandem. We applied these methodologies to a study of 165,000 patients across a network of 11 hospitals in the UK. Predictive modelling, specifically Classification and Regression Trees, forecasts patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic data. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic optimisation models determine optimal bed and staff planning strategies to minimise costs. Linking the predictive models with the prescriptive optimisation models, generates demand forecasts that inform the optimisation process, providing accurate and practical solutions. The results demonstrate that this integrated approach captures real-world variations in patient LOS and offers a 7% cost saving compared to average-based planning. This approach helps healthcare managers make robust decisions by incorporating patient-specific characteristics, improving capacity allocation, and mitigating risks associated with demand variability. Consequently, this combined methodology can be broadly extended across various sectors facing similar challenges, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of integrating predictive and prescriptive analytics.

Abstract: World models for autonomous driving have the potential to dramatically improve the reasoning capabilities of today's systems. However, most works focus on camera data, with only a few that leverage lidar data or combine both to better represent autonomous vehicle sensor setups. In addition, raw sensor predictions are less actionable than 3D occupancy predictions, but there are no works examining the effects of combining both multimodal sensor data and 3D occupancy prediction. In this work, we perform a set of experiments with a MUltimodal World Model with Geometric VOxel representations (MUVO) to evaluate different sensor fusion strategies to better understand the effects on sensor data prediction. We also analyze potential weaknesses of current sensor fusion approaches and examine the benefits of additionally predicting 3D occupancy.

Abstract: As a key component to intuitive cognition and reasoning solutions in human intelligence, causal knowledge provides great potential for reinforcement learning (RL) agents' interpretability towards decision-making by helping reduce the searching space. However, there is still a considerable gap in discovering and incorporating causality into RL, which hinders the rapid development of causal RL. In this paper, we consider explicitly modeling the generation process of states with the causal graphical model, based on which we augment the policy. We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions for causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal structure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the root cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement attributes to the virtuous cycle of causal-guided policy learning and causal structure learning, which aligns with our experimental results.

<title>Effective Bayesian Causal Inference via Structural Marginalisation and Autoregressive Orders</title>

Abstract: The traditional two-stage approach to causal inference first identifies a single causal model (or equivalence class of models), which is then used to answer causal queries. However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over all causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models, i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian processes to model mechanisms. To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore, we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects.

Abstract: This work addresses flexibility in deep learning by means of transductive reasoning. For adaptation to new data and tasks, e.g., in continual learning, existing methods typically involve tuning learnable parameters or complete re-training from scratch, rendering such approaches unflexible in practice. We argue that the notion of separating computation from memory by the means of transduction can act as a stepping stone for solving these issues. We therefore propose PARMESAN (parameter-free memory search and transduction), a scalable method which leverages a memory module for solving dense prediction tasks. At inference, hidden representations in memory are being searched to find corresponding patterns. In contrast to other methods that rely on continuous training of learnable parameters, PARMESAN learns via memory consolidation simply by modifying stored contents. Our method is compatible with commonly used architectures and canonically transfers to 1D, 2D, and 3D grid-based data. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated at the complex task of continual learning. PARMESAN learns by 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than established baselines while being on par in terms of predictive performance, hardware-efficiency, and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The development of machine learning applications has increased significantly in recent years, motivated by the remarkable ability of learning-powered systems to discover and generalize intricate patterns hidden in massive datasets. Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a complexity level that renders them opaque black boxes, lacking transparency and hindering our understanding of their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains requiring informed decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing explanations. Feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its ability to delineate the significance of input features in predictions. However, most attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations result from similar or the same instance. This work introduces T-Explainer, a novel additive attribution explainer based on the Taylor expansion that offers desirable properties such as local accuracy and consistency. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness and stability over multiple runs in quantitative benchmark experiments against well-known attribution methods. Additionally, we provide several tools to evaluate and visualize explanations, turning T-Explainer into a comprehensive XAI framework.

<title>Overcoming Knowledge Barriers: Online Imitation Learning from Visual Observation with Pretrained World Models</title>

Abstract: Pretraining and finetuning models has become increasingly popular in decision-making. But there are still serious impediments in Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) with pretrained models. This study identifies two primary obstacles: the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB). The EKB emerges due to the pretrained models' limitations in handling novel observations, which leads to inaccurate action inference. Conversely, the DKB stems from the reliance on limited demonstration datasets, restricting the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. We propose separate solutions to overcome each barrier and apply them to Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME), a state-of-the-art algorithm. This new algorithm, AIME-NoB, integrates online interactions and a data-driven regulariser to mitigate the EKB. Additionally, it uses a surrogate reward function to broaden the policy's supported states, addressing the DKB. Our experiments on vision-based control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and MetaWorld benchmarks show that AIME-NoB significantly improves sample efficiency and converged performance, presenting a robust framework for overcoming the challenges in ILfO with pretrained models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.

<title>On Minimizing Adversarial Counterfactual Error in Adversarial RL</title>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are highly susceptible to adversarial noise in observations, which poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. The challenge inherent to adversarial perturbations is that by altering the information observed by the agent, the state becomes only partially observable. Existing approaches address this by either enforcing consistent actions across nearby states or maximizing the worst-case value within adversarially perturbed observations. However, the former suffers from performance degradation when attacks succeed, while the latter tends to be overly conservative, leading to suboptimal performance in benign settings. We hypothesize that these limitations stem from their failing to account for partial observability directly. To this end, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), defined on the beliefs about the true state and balancing value optimization with robustness. To make ACoE scalable in model-free settings, we propose the theoretically-grounded surrogate objective Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL challenges, offering a promising direction for improving robustness in DRL under adversarial conditions. Our code is available at https://github.com/romanbelaire/acoe-robust-rl.

Abstract: We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model that also enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality. When trained on the classic game DOOM, GameNGen extracts gameplay and uses it to generate a playable environment that can interactively simulate new trajectories. GameNGen runs at 20 frames per second on a single TPU and remains stable over extended multi-minute play sessions. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation, even after 5 minutes of auto-regressive generation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations help ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories, and decoder fine-tuning improves the fidelity of visual details and text.

<title>On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs</title>

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, the normalized Transformer (nGPT) with representation learning on the hypersphere. In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.

Abstract: Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.

Abstract: Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. However, most of current batch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their performances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms. A Matlab implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Subspace_Improvement_Batch_Bayesian_Optimization.

Abstract: This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence.
  Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings are highly susceptible to the influence of even a small fraction of structured outliers, making robust optimization techniques essential. In particular, within the $\epsilon$-contamination model, where an adversary can inspect and replace up to an $\epsilon$-fraction of the samples, a fundamental open problem is determining the optimal rates for robust stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under such contamination. We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these stringent assumptions, assuming only population-level smoothness of the loss. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to handle the case in which the covariance parameter is unknown, and can be extended to nonsmooth population risks via convolutional smoothing. We complement our algorithmic developments with a tight information-theoretic lower bound for robust SCO.

Abstract: What types of numeric representations emerge in neural systems? What would a satisfying answer to this question look like? In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based counting tasks through a variety of lenses. We seek to understand how well we can understand NNs through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs), where SAs are defined by precise, abstract, mutable variables used to perform computations. We use GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained using Next Token Prediction (NTP) on numeric tasks where the solutions to the tasks depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret NN's raw activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the neural activity in terms of interpretable subspaces rather than individual neurons. Depending on the analysis, however, these interpretations can be graded, existing on a continuum, highlighting the philosophical question of what it means to "interpret" neural activity, and motivating us to introduce Alignment Functions to add flexibility to the existing Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) method. Through our specific analyses we show the importance of causal interventions for NN interpretability; we show that recurrent models develop graded, symbol-like number variables within their neural activity; we introduce a generalization of DAS to frame NN activity in terms of linear functions of interpretable variables; and we show that Transformers must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that avoid using cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers. We use our results to encourage interpreting NNs at the level of neural subspaces through the lens of SAs.

Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We find ourselves chiefly interested in the relationship between representations and behavior, asking ourselves how we can isolate specific functional aspects of representational similarity to relate our measures to behavior -- avoiding cause vs. correlation pitfalls in the process. In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity as it relates to behavior. The method learns invertible linear transformations that find an aligned subspace between two distributed networks' representations where functional information can be isolated and manipulated. We first show that the method can be used to transfer values of specific causal variables -- such as the number of items in a counting task -- between networks with different training seeds and different architectures. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different tasks, we explore differences between MAS and preexisting functional similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss that helps shape functionally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.

Abstract: Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.

Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their generation. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.

Abstract: The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.

Abstract: Task vectors, which are derived from the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights, enable flexible task adaptation and model merging through arithmetic operations such as addition and negation. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics with limited theoretical support, often leading to performance gaps comparing to direct task fine tuning. Meanwhile, although it is easy to manipulate saved task vectors with arithmetic for different purposes, such compositional flexibility demands high memory usage, especially when dealing with a huge number of tasks, limiting scalability. This work addresses these issues with a theoretically grounded framework that explains task vector arithmetic and introduces the task vector bases framework. Building upon existing task arithmetic literature, our method significantly reduces the memory cost for downstream arithmetic with little effort, while achieving competitive performance and maintaining compositional advantage, providing a practical solution for large-scale task arithmetic. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/TaskVectorBasis.

Abstract: We consider linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms driven by martingale noise. Recent applications in machine learning motivate the need to understand finite-time error rates, but conventional stochastic approximation analysis focus on either asymptotic convergence in distribution or finite-time bounds that are far from optimal. Prior work on asymptotic central limit theorems (CLTs) suggest that two-time-scale algorithms may be able to achieve $1/\sqrt{n}$ error in expectation, with a constant given by the expected norm of the limiting Gaussian vector. However, the best known finite-time rates are much slower. We derive the first non-asymptotic central limit theorem with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance for two-time-scale stochastic approximation with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. As a corollary, we show that expected error achieved by Polyak-Ruppert averaging decays at rate $1/\sqrt{n}$, which significantly improves on the rates of convergence in prior works.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting the highest quality data for analysis highly increases task accuracy and efficiency, it is still a hard task, especially when the number of available inputs is very large. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from datasets similar to the queried one. Dataset similarity is performed via projecting each dataset to a vector embedding representation. The vectorization process is performed using our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, which takes a whole dataset and projects it into a lower vector embedding representation space. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation and distinguish between them.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning systems has raised critical concerns about fairness and bias, making mitigating harmful biases essential for AI development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between debiasing and removing artifacts in neural networks for computer vision tasks. First, we introduce a set of novel XAI-based metrics that analyze saliency maps to assess shifts in a model's decision-making process. Then, we demonstrate that successful debiasing methods systematically redirect model focus away from protected attributes. Finally, we show that techniques originally developed for artifact removal can be effectively repurposed for improving fairness. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a bidirectional connection between ensuring fairness and removing artifacts corresponding to protected attributes.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.

Abstract: The challenge of noisy multi-objective optimization lies in the constant trade-off between exploring new decision points and improving the precision of known points through resampling. This decision should take into account both the variability of the objective functions and the current estimate of a point in relation to the Pareto front. Since the amount and distribution of noise are generally unknown, it is desirable for a decision function to be highly adaptive to the properties of the optimization problem. This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance. The distribution-free estimation of the probability of dominance is achieved using bootstrap estimates of the means. To make the procedure applicable even with very few observations, we transfer the distribution observed at other decision points. The efficiency of this resampling approach is demonstrated by applying it in the NSGA-II algorithm with a sequential resampling procedure under multiple noise variations.

<title>A Robust Model-Based Approach for Continuous-Time Policy Evaluation with Unknown L\'evy Process Dynamics</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a model-based framework for continuous-time policy evaluation (CTPE) in reinforcement learning, incorporating both Brownian and L\'evy noise to model stochastic dynamics influenced by rare and extreme events. Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by L\'evy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed L\'evy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.

Abstract: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

Abstract: It often happens that some sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers or passwords, are mistakenly incorporated in the training of machine learning models and need to be removed afterwards. The removal of such information from a trained model is a complex task that needs to partially reverse the training process. There have been various machine unlearning techniques proposed in the literature to address this problem. Most of the proposed methods revolve around removing individual data samples from a trained model. Another less explored direction is when features/labels of a group of data samples need to be reverted. While the existing methods for these tasks do the unlearning task by updating the whole set of model parameters or only the last layer of the model, we show that there are a subset of model parameters that have the largest contribution in the unlearning target features. More precisely, the model parameters with the largest corresponding diagonal value in the Hessian matrix (computed at the learned model parameter) have the most contribution in the unlearning task. By selecting these parameters and updating them during the unlearning stage, we can have the most progress in unlearning. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed strategy by connecting it to sharpness-aware minimization and robust unlearning. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving the efficacy of unlearning with a low computational cost.

Abstract: One global model in federated learning (FL) might not be sufficient to serve many clients with non-IID tasks and distributions. While there has been advances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they only provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can create a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models with automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global models can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the merging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server broadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs to send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of periodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global model, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data distribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds caused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID settings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in which FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including clustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.

Abstract: The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.

Abstract: Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.

Abstract: In data clustering, it is often desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions that describes the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.

Both approaches enable conditional sampling and conditional density estimation, which are core tasks in Bayesian inference$\unicode{x2013}$particularly in the simulation-based ($\unicode{x201C}$likelihood-free$\unicode{x201D}$) setting. Our methods represent the target conditional distribution as a transformation of a tractable reference distribution. Obtaining such a transformation, chosen here to be an approximation of the COT map, is computationally challenging even in moderate dimensions. To improve scalability, our numerical algorithms use neural networks to parameterize candidate maps and further exploit the structure of the COT problem. Our static approach approximates the map as the gradient of a partially input-convex neural network. It uses a novel numerical implementation to increase computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Our dynamic approach approximates the conditional optimal transport via the flow map of a regularized neural ODE; compared to the static approach, it is slower to train but offers more modeling choices and can lead to faster sampling. We demonstrate both algorithms numerically, comparing them with competing state-of-the-art approaches, using benchmark datasets and simulation-based Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Visible (VIS) imagery is important for monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs) but is unavailable at night. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to generate nighttime VIS imagery with significantly enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution. Our method offers three key improvements compared to existing models. First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.

Abstract: Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points. This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making in downstream tasks. Existing methods quantify uncertainty at the last layer or other approximations of the network which may miss some sources of uncertainty in the model. To address this gap, we propose an uncertainty quantification method for large networks based on variation due to regularization. Essentially, predictions that are more (less) sensitive to the regularization of network parameters are less (more, respectively) certain. This principle can be implemented by deterministically tweaking the training loss during the fine-tuning phase and reflects confidence in the output as a function of all layers of the network. We show that regularization variation (RegVar) provides rigorous uncertainty estimates that, in the infinitesimal limit, exactly recover the Laplace approximation in Bayesian deep learning. We demonstrate its success in several deep learning architectures, showing it can scale tractably with the network size while maintaining or improving uncertainty quantification quality. Our experiments across multiple datasets show that RegVar not only identifies uncertain predictions effectively but also provides insights into the stability of learned representations.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and early detection through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown significant promise in reducing death rates. With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging, the development and evaluation of robust AI models require access to large, well-annotated datasets. In this study, we introduce the utility of Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) Dataset, the largest open-access LDCT dataset with over 2,000 scans and 3,000 expert-verified nodules. We benchmark deep learning models for both 3D nodule detection and lung cancer classification across internal and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D+. For detection, we develop two MONAI-based RetinaNet models (DLCSDmD and LUNA16-mD), evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For classification, we compare five models, including state-of-the-art pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a selfsupervised foundation model (FMCB), a randomly initialized ResNet50, and proposed a novel Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++) model. SWS++ uses curated candidate patches to pretrain a classification backbone within the same detection pipeline, enabling task-relevant feature learning. Our models demonstrated strong generalizability, with SWS++ achieving comparable or superior performance to existing foundational models across multiple datasets (AUC: 0.71 to 0.90). All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility and collaboration. This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting future efforts in model development, validation, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.

Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.

<title>RSEND: Retinex-based Squeeze and Excitation Network with Dark Region Detection for Efficient Low Light Image Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Images captured under low-light scenarios often suffer from low quality. Previous CNN-based deep learning methods often involve using Retinex theory. Nevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets like LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of these methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the procedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.

<title>ReaL: Efficient RLHF Training of Large Language Models with Parameter Reallocation</title>

arXiv:2406.14088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .

Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context. The code is available at https://github.com/corne00/DDU-Net.

Abstract: Sequential multiple-instance learning involves learning representations of sets distributed across discrete timesteps. In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.

<title>A causal viewpoint on prediction model performance under changes in case-mix: discrimination and calibration respond differently for prognosis and diagnosis predictions</title>

Abstract: Prediction models need reliable predictive performance as they inform clinical decisions, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The predictive performance of these models is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. Changes in the distribution of the data impact model performance and there may be important changes between a model's current application and when and where its performance was last evaluated. In health-care, a typical change is a shift in case-mix. For example, for cardiovascular risk management, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a specialist in a tertiary hospital.
  This work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the case for prognosis predictions), calibration remains stable under case-mix shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination remains stable, but calibration does not.
  A simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. The causal case-mix framework provides insights for developing, evaluating and deploying prediction models across different clinical settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causal structure of the prediction task.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.

arXiv:2409.17685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the growing trends in machine learning is the use of data generation techniques, since the performance of machine learning models is dependent on the quantity of the training dataset. However, in many real-world applications, particularly in medical and low-resource domains, collecting large datasets is challenging due to resource constraints, which leads to overfitting and poor generalization. This study introduces FICAug, a novel feature-to-image data augmentation framework designed to improve model generalization under limited data conditions by generating structured synthetic samples.
  FICAug first operates in the feature space, where original data are clustered using the k-means algorithm. Within pure-label clusters, synthetic data are generated through Gaussian sampling to increase diversity while maintaining label consistency. These synthetic features are then projected back into the image domain using a generative neural network, and a convolutional neural network is trained on the reconstructed images to learn enhanced representations.
  Experimental results demonstrate that FICAug significantly improves classification accuracy. In feature space, it achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 84.09%, while training a ResNet-18 model on the reconstructed images further boosted performance to 88.63%, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in extracting new and task-relevant features.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are powerful state-of-the-art methods used to generate synthetic data from high-dimensional data distributions and are widely used for image, audio, and video generation as well as many more applications in science and beyond. The \textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction.
  In this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.

Abstract: Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.

Abstract: Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.

Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We introduce a framework that automatically discovers a low-dimensional and operable representation of system dynamics, including a set of compact state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and a differentiable vector field, directly from video without requiring prior domain-specific knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of a range of dynamical systems, including the identification of stable equilibria, the prediction of natural frequencies, and the detection of of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. The results highlight the potential of our data-driven approach to advance automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.

Abstract: Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.

<title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.

Abstract: The forest serves as the most significant terrestrial carbon stock mechanism, effectively reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigating climate change. Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17%, significantly improving by 41.69% to 42.33% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.

Abstract: Automated assessment of surgical skills using artificial intelligence (AI) provides trainees with instantaneous feedback. After bimanual tool motions are captured, derived kinematic metrics are reliable predictors of performance in laparoscopic tasks. Implementing automated tool tracking requires time-intensive human annotation. We developed AI-based tool tracking using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to eliminate the need for human annotators. Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation. We demonstrated an AI model capable of automated performance classification, independent of human annotation.

Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.

Abstract: Model uncertainty quantification involves measuring and evaluating the uncertainty linked to a model's predictions, helping assess their reliability and confidence. Noise injection is a technique used to enhance the robustness of neural networks by introducing randomness. In this paper, we establish a connection between noise injection and uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian standpoint. We theoretically demonstrate that injecting noise into the weights of a neural network is equivalent to Bayesian inference on a deep Gaussian process. Consequently, we introduce a Monte Carlo Noise Injection (MCNI) method, which involves injecting noise into the parameters during training and performing multiple forward propagations during inference to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction. Through simulation and experiments on regression and classification tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline model.

Abstract: The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.

<title>Are Transformers Able to Reason by Connecting Separated Knowledge in Training Data?</title>

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to produce predictions that serve as input data in subsequent statistical analyses. For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.

<title>Robot Pouring: Identifying Causes of Spillage and Selecting Alternative Action Parameters Using Probabilistic Actual Causation</title>

Abstract: In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.

Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: In the current insurance literature, prediction of insurance claims in the regression problem is often performed with a statistical model. This model-based approach may potentially suffer from several drawbacks: (i) model misspecification, (ii) selection effect, and (iii) lack of finite-sample validity. This article addresses these three issues simultaneously by employing conformal prediction -- a general machine learning strategy for valid predictions. The proposed method is both model-free and tuning-parameter-free. It also guarantees finite-sample validity at a pre-assigned coverage probability level. Examples, based on both simulated and real data, are provided to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method and its applications in insurance, especially regarding meeting the solvency capital requirement of European insurance regulation, Solvency II.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has made great strides in identifying neural network features (e.g., directions in hidden activation space) that mediate concepts(e.g., the birth year of a person) and enable predictable manipulation. Distributed alignment search (DAS) leverages supervision from counterfactual data to learn concept features within hidden states, but DAS assumes we can afford to conduct a brute force search over potential feature locations. To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.

Abstract: Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. In our work, we find that token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we introduce Emb2Emb, a simple method to transfer steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.

Abstract: Despite significant recent advances in probabilistic meta-learning, it is common for practitioners to avoid using deep learning models due to a comparative lack of interpretability. Instead, many practitioners simply use non-meta-models such as Gaussian processes with interpretable priors, and conduct the tedious procedure of training their model from scratch for each task they encounter. While this is justifiable for tasks with a limited number of data points, the cubic computational cost of exact Gaussian process inference renders this prohibitive when each task has many observations. To remedy this, we introduce a family of models that meta-learn sparse Gaussian process inference. Not only does this enable rapid prediction on new tasks with sparse Gaussian processes, but since our models have clear interpretations as members of the neural process family, it also allows manual elicitation of priors in a neural process for the first time. In meta-learning regimes for which the number of observed tasks is small or for which expert domain knowledge is available, this offers a crucial advantage.

Abstract: Over the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in engineering domains has gained significant popularity, showcasing their potential in data-driven contexts. However, the complexity and diversity of engineering problems often require the development of domain-specific AI approaches, which are frequently hindered by a lack of systematic methodologies, scalability, and robustness during the development process. To address this gap, this paper introduces the "ABCDE" as the key elements of Engineering AI and proposes a unified, systematic engineering AI ecosystem framework, including eight essential layers, along with attributes, goals, and applications, to guide the development and deployment of AI solutions for specific engineering needs. Additionally, key challenges are examined, and eight future research directions are highlighted. By providing a comprehensive perspective, this paper aims to advance the strategic implementation of AI, fostering the development of next-generation engineering AI solutions.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit unpredictable properties in response to environmental stressors, due to several composition-dependent degradation mechanisms. In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (>85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (>75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.

Abstract: As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have focused on system-level engineering, little is explored from a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.
  In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for large language model (LLM) inference, bridging the gap between the queueing theory and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FasterTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits that the queueing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary development.

Abstract: Artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) degrade signal quality and impact the analysis of brain activity. Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other approaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the epoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automating the detection and localization of artifacts in wearable sleep EEG.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.

<div> Keywords: tabular data, representation learning, deep neural networks, specialized models, transferable models

Summary:
Tabular data, organized as rows and columns, is prevalent in machine learning applications. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in learning from tabular data due to their representation learning capabilities. This survey introduces tabular representation learning, discussing the challenges, benchmarks, and the use of DNNs. Methods are categorized into specialized, transferable, and general models based on their generalization capabilities. Specialized models focus on tasks within the same data distribution, while transferable models are pre-trained on datasets and fine-tuned on downstream tasks. General models, or tabular foundation models, can be directly applied to tasks without fine-tuning. Ensemble methods and extensions to tabular learning are also explored. The survey provides a detailed taxonomy of specialized models and strategies for obtaining high-quality representations at feature- and sample-level.

Abstract: Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

<br />
Summary: <br />
SparseJEPA is proposed as an extension to JEPA models, integrating sparse representation learning to improve the quality of learned representations. By encouraging shared latent space variables among data features with strong semantic relationships, SparseJEPA maintains predictive performance while enhancing interpretability. Training on CIFAR-100 and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer show the effectiveness of SparseJEPA in image classification and low-level tasks through linear-probe transfer learning. The architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks is highlighted. The theoretical proof demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality by reducing Multiinformation among latent variables and upholding the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. By incorporating sparsity, SparseJEPA not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations, with the potential for further extension in object-centric representation learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) have emerged as a powerful framework for learning general-purpose representations. However, these models often lack interpretability and suffer from inefficiencies due to dense embedding representations. We propose SparseJEPA, an extension that integrates sparse representation learning into the JEPA framework to enhance the quality of learned representations. SparseJEPA employs a penalty method that encourages latent space variables to be shared among data features with strong semantic relationships, while maintaining predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseJEPA by training on the CIFAR-100 dataset and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer. The improved embeddings are utilized in linear-probe transfer learning for both image classification and low-level tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof that demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality. This was done by displaying that grouping reduces Multiinformation among latent-variables, including proofing the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. Our results indicate that incorporating sparsity not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations. In further work, hope to further extend this method by finding new ways to leverage the grouping mechanism through object-centric representation learning.

Summary: 
This study reviews process-based models (PBMs), deep learning (DL) models, and hybrid PBM-DL frameworks in agricultural and environmental modelling. Hybrid models, combining the strengths of PBMs and DL, outperform traditional PBMs and DL models in predicting crop dry biomass, especially in noisy data and unseen locations. Challenges such as model interpretability, scalability, and data requirements are discussed, with recommendations for advancing hybrid modelling in agriculture.

arXiv:2504.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process-based models (PBMs) and deep learning (DL) are two key approaches in agricultural modelling, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. PBMs provide mechanistic insights based on physical and biological principles, ensuring interpretability and scientific rigour. However, they often struggle with scalability, parameterisation, and adaptation to heterogeneous environments. In contrast, DL models excel at capturing complex, nonlinear patterns from large datasets but may suffer from limited interpretability, high computational demands, and overfitting in data-scarce scenarios.
  This study presents a systematic review of PBMs, DL models, and hybrid PBM-DL frameworks, highlighting their applications in agricultural and environmental modelling. We classify hybrid PBM-DL approaches into DL-informed PBMs, where neural networks refine process-based models, and PBM-informed DL, where physical constraints guide deep learning predictions. Additionally, we conduct a case study on crop dry biomass prediction, comparing hybrid models against standalone PBMs and DL models under varying data quality, sample sizes, and spatial conditions. The results demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform traditional PBMs and DL models, offering greater robustness to noisy data and improved generalisation across unseen locations.
  Finally, we discuss key challenges, including model interpretability, scalability, and data requirements, alongside actionable recommendations for advancing hybrid modelling in agriculture. By integrating domain knowledge with AI-driven approaches, this study contributes to the development of scalable, interpretable, and reproducible agricultural models that support data-driven decision-making for sustainable agriculture.

<div> Keywords: Deep Learning, GPU optimization, Hexcute, Matrix Multiplication, Quantization

Summary:
Hexcute is a new tile-based programming language designed to optimize deep learning workloads running on GPUs, especially for operators with mixed input data types. This language aims to strike a balance between expressiveness and programming effort by providing fine-grained optimization capabilities through shared memory and register abstractions. Hexcute also utilizes task mapping to schedule GPU programs efficiently. A key feature of Hexcute is its automation of layout and task mapping synthesis using a type-inference-based algorithm, reducing the programming effort required. Evaluation results show that Hexcute outperforms existing deep learning compilers for mixed-type operators, achieving significant speedups ranging from 1.7 to 11.28 times. In end-to-end evaluations, Hexcute brings up to 2.91 times speedup, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing deep learning workloads for GPUs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a novel approach using phonemes as a textual representation in multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Two models were trained on the WMT17 dataset, one using standard text representation and the other using phonemic representation. Evaluation using the BLEU metric showed that the phonemic approach achieved comparable quality to the traditional text-based approach while offering advantages such as lower resource requirements and better suitability for low-resource languages. This new method opens up possibilities for more efficient and effective multilingual translation systems, particularly in scenarios where resources are limited or languages are less commonly spoken. <div>

Abstract: This paper explores the idea of using phonemes as a textual representation within a conventional multilingual simultaneous speech-to-speech translation pipeline, as opposed to the traditional reliance on text-based language representations. To investigate this, we trained an open-source sequence-to-sequence model on the WMT17 dataset in two formats: one using standard textual representation and the other employing phonemic representation. The performance of both approaches was assessed using the BLEU metric. Our findings shows that the phonemic approach provides comparable quality but offers several advantages, including lower resource requirements or better suitability for low-resource languages.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel framework for fairness adjustments in machine learning, catering to various tasks and fairness metrics. Unlike traditional approaches, this method decouples fairness adjustments from model training, preserving model performance while enhancing flexibility. It eliminates the need for custom loss functions and allows fairness tuning with different datasets.

Comparing it to Adversarial Debiasing, the framework shows comparable fairness/accuracy tradeoff on real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: As machine learning increasingly influences critical domains such as credit underwriting, public policy, and talent acquisition, ensuring compliance with fairness constraints is both a legal and ethical imperative. This paper introduces a novel framework for fairness adjustments that applies to diverse machine learning tasks, including regression and classification, and accommodates a wide range of fairness metrics. Unlike traditional approaches categorized as pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, our method adapts in-processing techniques for use as a post-processing step. By decoupling fairness adjustments from the model training process, our framework preserves model performance on average while enabling greater flexibility in model development. Key advantages include eliminating the need for custom loss functions, enabling fairness tuning using different datasets, accommodating proprietary models as black-box systems, and providing interpretable insights into the fairness adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to Adversarial Debiasing, showing that our framework achieves a comparable fairness/accuracy tradeoff on real-world datasets.

Summary:
FairPlay is a web-based software application designed to address the issue of fairness in decision-making by enabling multiple stakeholders to collaboratively debias datasets. By adopting a strategic interaction approach, FairPlay allows users to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable outcome without the need for a universally agreed-upon theory of fairness. Through user studies, it was demonstrated that users could reach a consensus within about five rounds of gameplay using FairPlay. This highlights the potential of the application in enhancing fairness in AI systems by providing a systematic negotiation process and the ability to modify and observe changes in real-time. FairPlay offers a solution to the challenge of balancing differing and mutually incompatible versions of fairness demanded by stakeholders, making it a valuable tool for promoting fairness in decision-making processes.

Abstract: The issue of fairness in decision-making is a critical one, especially given the variety of stakeholder demands for differing and mutually incompatible versions of fairness. Adopting a strategic interaction of perspectives provides an alternative to enforcing a singular standard of fairness. We present a web-based software application, FairPlay, that enables multiple stakeholders to debias datasets collaboratively. With FairPlay, users can negotiate and arrive at a mutually acceptable outcome without a universally agreed-upon theory of fairness. In the absence of such a tool, reaching a consensus would be highly challenging due to the lack of a systematic negotiation process and the inability to modify and observe changes. We have conducted user studies that demonstrate the success of FairPlay, as users could reach a consensus within about five rounds of gameplay, illustrating the application's potential for enhancing fairness in AI systems.

Summary:<br /><br />Energy-based models are powerful generative models but lack exploration of potential flows. Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB) is proposed as a new framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling, auxiliary networks, or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow through a flow-driven density homotopy matched to the data distribution. This formulation allows for robust and efficient generative modeling while maintaining interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate VPFB's effectiveness in image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation, showing competitive performance in sample quality and versatility across various generative modeling tasks. <div>
arXiv:2504.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) are a powerful class of probabilistic generative models due to their flexibility and interpretability. However, relationships between potential flows and explicit EBMs remain underexplored, while contrastive divergence training via implicit Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is often unstable and expensive in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB), a new energy-based generative framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on auxiliary networks or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow by constructing a flow-driven density homotopy that is matched to the data distribution through a variational loss minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the flow-driven and marginal homotopies. This principled formulation enables robust and efficient generative modeling while preserving the interpretability of EBMs. Experimental results on image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation confirm the effectiveness of VPFB, showing that our method performs competitively with existing approaches in terms of sample quality and versatility across diverse generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a performance benchmarking study of a Gradient-Optimized Fuzzy Inference System (GF) classifier against several state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The evaluation was conducted across five datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, each chosen for their diversity in input types, class distributions, and classification complexity. Unlike traditional Fuzzy Inference Systems that rely on derivative-free optimization methods, the GF leverages gradient descent to significantly improving training efficiency and predictive performance. Results demonstrate that the GF model achieved competitive, and in several cases superior, classification accuracy while maintaining high precision and exceptionally low training times. In particular, the GF exhibited strong consistency across folds and datasets, underscoring its robustness in handling noisy data and variable feature sets. These findings support the potential of gradient optimized fuzzy systems as interpretable, efficient, and adaptable alternatives to more complex deep learning models in supervised learning tasks.

arXiv:2504.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines for large language model (LLM) alignment typically assign scalar rewards to sequences, using the final token as a surrogate indicator for the quality of the entire sequence. However, this leads to sparse feedback and suboptimal token-level credit assignment. In this work, we frame reward shaping as an optimization problem focused on token-level credit assignment. We propose a reward-shaping function leveraging explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to estimate per-token rewards from the reward model. To learn parameters of this shaping function, we employ a bilevel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian Optimization and policy training to handle noise from the token reward estimates. Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level reward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on downstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training. Furthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature additive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original reward.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, Softmax, attention matrix, doubly stochastic matrix, quantum circuit

Summary: 
A new study introduces a hybrid classical-quantum Transformer called QDSFormer, which replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the recent discovery that doubly stochastic matrices (DSMs) can be obtained using parametric quantum circuits, providing a unique quantum inductive bias. The QDSFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to standard Vision Transformers and other doubly stochastic Transformers across small-scale object recognition tasks. The quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer, based on QR decomposition, is also compared. The QDSFormer exhibits improved training stability and reduced performance variation, suggesting it may help alleviate the training instability commonly observed in Vision Transformers on small-scale datasets. <div>
arXiv:2504.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often destabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.

<div> Rare species, bird call classification, automated pipeline, conservation monitoring, endangered birds
<br />
The paper introduces an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline tailored for rare bird species not covered by existing large classifiers. These classifiers are proficient in detecting common birds but lack the capability to identify species with limited recordings, crucial for conservation efforts monitoring endangered birds. By utilizing embedding spaces of large bird classification networks and employing cosine similarity, filtering, and denoising techniques, the pipeline optimizes detection with minimal training data. Evaluation of various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validation on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving perfect recall and high accuracy in detecting the bird's calls. This open-source system serves as a practical tool for conservationists to detect and monitor rare species facing extinction.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

<div> subset selection, machine learning, dataset curation, deployment-specific, benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces the Dataset Subset Selection for Specialization (DS3) problem, focusing on the need for selecting specialized subsets from training data to optimize model performance on deployment-specific distributions. The DataS^3 benchmark is introduced to evaluate algorithms for DS3 across diverse real-world application domains. Results show that general-distribution methods often fail on deployment-specific tasks, emphasizing the importance of tailored dataset curation. Expert subsets curated for specific deployments outperform training on all available data, showcasing accuracy gains of up to 51.3 percent. The study highlights the critical role of dataset curation in enhancing model performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions. This becomes particularly important as global datasets become more available and machine learning models are deployed in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world machine learning (ML) applications (e.g. detecting broken bones in x-ray images, detecting species in camera traps), in practice models need to perform well on specific deployments (e.g. a specific hospital, a specific national park) rather than the domain broadly. However, deployments often have imbalanced, unique data distributions. Discrepancy between the training distribution and the deployment distribution can lead to suboptimal performance, highlighting the need to select deployment-specialized subsets from the available training data. We formalize dataset subset selection for specialization (DS3): given a training set drawn from a general distribution and a (potentially unlabeled) query set drawn from the desired deployment-specific distribution, the goal is to select a subset of the training data that optimizes deployment performance.
  We introduce DataS^3; the first dataset and benchmark designed specifically for the DS3 problem. DataS^3 encompasses diverse real-world application domains, each with a set of distinct deployments to specialize in. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating algorithms from various families--including coresets, data filtering, and data curation--on DataS^3, and find that general-distribution methods consistently fail on deployment-specific tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of manually curated (deployment-specific) expert subsets that outperform training on all available data with accuracy gains up to 51.3 percent. Our benchmark highlights the critical role of tailored dataset curation in enhancing performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions, which we posit will only become more important as global, public datasets become available across domains and ML models are deployed in the real world.

<div> Keywords: atypical speech, affect recognition, speech models, robustness, emotion modeling 

Summary: 
The study evaluates the impact of speech atypicalities on affect recognition models, specifically focusing on intelligibility, monopitch, and harshness. The research compares the performance of existing affect recognition models on atypical speech datasets to those of typical speech. Results show that atypical speech significantly affects affect predictions, with a higher proportion of sadness predicted in atypical speech. Fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without affecting typical speech performance. The findings highlight the importance of broader training and evaluation datasets for speech emotion models and the need for robust modeling approaches that can accommodate voice and speech differences. This research underscores the necessity of addressing speech variations in affect recognition models for individuals with atypical speech patterns. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech and voice conditions can alter the acoustic properties of speech, which could impact the performance of paralinguistic models for affect for people with atypical speech. We evaluate publicly available models for recognizing categorical and dimensional affect from speech on a dataset of atypical speech, comparing results to datasets of typical speech. We investigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is related to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and harshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional trends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional comparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical speech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for spontaneous speech for valence and arousal. We find that the output of affect models is significantly impacted by the presence and degree of speech atypicalities. For instance, the percentage of speech predicted as sad is significantly higher for all types and grades of atypical speech when compared to similar typical speech datasets. In a preliminary investigation on improving robustness for atypical speech, we find that fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without impacting performance on typical speech. Our results emphasize the need for broader training and evaluation datasets for speech emotion models, and for modeling approaches that are robust to voice and speech differences.

This article provides a reflective examination of the evolution, strengths, and limitations of cosine similarity, discussing where it excels and where it falls short.

Abstract: Cosine similarity has become a standard metric for comparing embeddings in modern machine learning. Its scale-invariance and alignment with model training objectives have contributed to its widespread adoption. However, recent studies have revealed important limitations, particularly when embedding norms carry meaningful semantic information. This informal article offers a reflective and selective examination of the evolution, strengths, and limitations of cosine similarity. We highlight why it performs well in many settings, where it tends to break down, and how emerging alternatives are beginning to address its blind spots. We hope to offer a mix of conceptual clarity and practical perspective, especially for quantitative scientists who think about embeddings not just as vectors, but as geometric and philosophical objects.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) as a novel approach for graph representation learning. GOMKCN views graphs as node-centric subgraphs, enabling the recognition of structural patterns within the data. By leveraging the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, GOMKCN computes similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. This allows for the disentanglement of representations and the adaptive capture of relevant structural patterns. GOMK addresses the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels by incorporating local correspondences in similarity measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that GOMKCN outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability, making significant advances in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework lays the groundwork for further developments in disentangled graph representation learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs effectively characterize relational data, driving graph representation learning methods that uncover underlying predictive information. As state-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end learning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning enhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data. However, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph structures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph. This paper proposes the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) to address this limitation. We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each subgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information. This transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired by CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert space, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge from projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture relevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates local correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels. Experiments validate that GOMKCN achieves superior accuracy and interpretability in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework advances the theoretical foundation for disentangled graph representation learning.

<div> Keywords: non-stationary reinforcement learning, average-reward setting, policy-based algorithm, dynamic regret, Markov Decision Process

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on non-stationary reinforcement learning in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting, where the variation budget of the Markov Decision Process is taken into account. Traditional algorithms for non-stationary RL concentrate on model-based and model-free value-based methods, while policy-based approaches are less explored. The proposed Non-Stationary Natural Actor-Critic (NS-NAC) algorithm is a model-free policy-based method that utilizes restart-based exploration for adaptability. Additionally, the BORL-NS-NAC algorithm is introduced as a parameter-free alternative without prior knowledge of the variation budget. Both algorithms exhibit a dynamic regret analysis with a complexity that scales with the sizes of the state and action spaces, the variation budget, and the time horizon. The study provides insights into the adaptation of policy and value function estimates in dynamic environments, offering a comprehensive understanding of non-stationary RL algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2504.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL) in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting. We model it by a Markov Decision Process with time-varying rewards and transition probabilities, with a variation budget of $\Delta_T$. Existing non-stationary RL algorithms focus on model-based and model-free value-based methods. Policy-based methods despite their flexibility in practice are not theoretically well understood in non-stationary RL. We propose and analyze the first model-free policy-based algorithm, Non-Stationary Natural Actor-Critic (NS-NAC), a policy gradient method with a restart based exploration for change and a novel interpretation of learning rates as adapting factors. Further, we present a bandit-over-RL based parameter-free algorithm BORL-NS-NAC that does not require prior knowledge of the variation budget $\Delta_T$. We present a dynamic regret of $\tilde{\mathscr O}(|S|^{1/2}|A|^{1/2}\Delta_T^{1/6}T^{5/6})$ for both algorithms, where $T$ is the time horizon, and $|S|$, $|A|$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. The regret analysis leverages a novel adaptation of the Lyapunov function analysis of NAC to dynamic environments and characterizes the effects of simultaneous updates in policy, value function estimate and changes in the environment.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new data attribution method called MAGIC, aiming to estimate the impact on model predictions by adding or removing training data. While existing methods are effective in convex settings, they struggle in large-scale non-convex settings, showing weak correlation with ground truth. MAGIC combines classical techniques with recent advancements in metadifferentiation to provide optimal estimates in non-convex scenarios. By leveraging metadifferentiation, MAGIC can effectively estimate how modifications in the training data influence model predictions, offering a significant improvement over current methods. The proposed method enhances the understanding of the impact of data manipulation on predictive models, contributing to more accurate predictions and model interpretation in complex, real-world scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of predictive data attribution is to estimate how adding or removing a given set of training datapoints will affect model predictions. In convex settings, this goal is straightforward (i.e., via the infinitesimal jackknife). In large-scale (non-convex) settings, however, existing methods are far less successful -- current methods' estimates often only weakly correlate with ground truth. In this work, we present a new data attribution method (MAGIC) that combines classical methods and recent advances in metadifferentiation to (nearly) optimally estimate the effect of adding or removing training data on model predictions.

Summary:
Discrete diffusion is a powerful framework for modeling and generating discrete data, and the Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM) objective enhances its training and fine-tuning capabilities. TCSM offers a versatile approach by estimating the concrete score of the target distribution in the clean data space. This enables seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, enhancing sample efficiency and flexibility. TCSM supports pre-training directly from data samples and various post-training scenarios like fine-tuning with reward functions or distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. Experimental results on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM outperforms existing methods while offering greater adaptability and efficiency in both pre-training and post-training phases. The TCSM framework extends the capabilities of discrete diffusion models, making them more effective for a wide range of applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion is a promising framework for modeling and generating discrete data. In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM), a novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion models. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports pre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many existing discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our more general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to post-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward functions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM, estimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the original (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean data space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes. Our experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or surpasses current methods. Additionally, TCSM is versatile, applicable to both pre-training and post-training scenarios, offering greater flexibility and sample efficiency.

Abstract: As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.

<div> DP-FL, Federated Learning, DP synthetic data, LLMs, POPri<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new method called Preference Optimization for Private Client Data (POPri) that leverages private client feedback as preference rankings to generate high-quality DP synthetic data for Federated Learning (FL) applications. The algorithm utilizes preference optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune Language Model (LLMs) on federated client data. The authors release a new federated text benchmark called LargeFedBench for uncontaminated LLM evaluations, comparing POPri against existing benchmarks. Results show that POPri significantly enhances the utility of DP synthetic data, closing the accuracy gap between fully-private and non-private settings by up to 68%. This outperforms prior synthetic data methods by 16% and state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods by 58%. The code and data for POPri are publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as a preference ranking. Our algorithm, Preference Optimization for Private Client Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 68%, compared to 52% for prior synthetic data methods, and 10% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/meiyuw/POPri.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel numerical method for analyzing severe accidents in nuclear power plants using physics-informed neural networks (PINN). The traditional thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes like MELCOR and MAAP have limitations due to their finite difference schemes. The proposed node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) addresses these limitations by assigning a network to each nodalization, ensuring spatial information is excluded from input and output domains. The accuracy of PINN methods was evaluated for a hydrodynamic module, with NA-PINN showing superior accuracy compared to regular PINN. This study marks the first successful implementation of a system code using PINN. Future work aims to extend NA-PINN to a multi-physics solver and develop it in a surrogate manner.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Severe accidents (SAs) in nuclear power plants have been analyzed using thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes such as MELCOR and MAAP. These codes efficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent limitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of empirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations inherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The objective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system codes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in solving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic differentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for the control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of spatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each nodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from both the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a purely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN methods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and NA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It should be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a system code using PINN. Our future work involves extending NA-PINN to a multi-physics solver and developing it in a surrogate manner.

<div> contraction factor, perturbation factor, generalization gap, deep network, gradient descent<br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents a differential equation that describes the evolution of the generalization gap in deep networks trained using gradient descent. The equation is influenced by a contraction factor that brings together trajectories from slightly different datasets and a perturbation factor accounting for training on distinct datasets. Through analysis, an "effective Gram matrix" is computed to predict the generalization gap post-training by considering alignment with an initial residual. Empirical assessments on image classification datasets show accurate test loss prediction. During training, the residual primarily resides in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix's smallest eigenvalues, indicating a benign training process with minimal generalization gap deterioration. The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual varies based on dataset and architecture, determining good or poor generalization performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process is benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the generalization gap (which is zero at initialization). The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual is different for different datasets and architectures. The match/mismatch of the data and the architecture is primarily responsible for good/bad generalization.

<div> evaluation scenario, continual learning, user representation learning, adaptive, item distribution

Summary:<br />
Traditional user modeling approaches are limited in their ability to generalize and adapt to various tasks. Recent studies have focused on continual learning for universal user representation learning, aiming to create models capable of handling multiple tasks. However, existing methods are evaluated in unrealistic scenarios that do not consider the passage of time and changes in item distribution as tasks progress. This paper introduces a practical evaluation scenario that takes into account these factors. A novel framework called DITTO is proposed to address catastrophic forgetting and adapt to the shifting item distribution over time. Extensive experiments show that DITTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in this practical evaluation scenario. The source code for DITTO is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Traditional user modeling (UM) approaches have primarily focused on designing models for a single specific task, but they face limitations in generalization and adaptability across various tasks. Recognizing these challenges, recent studies have shifted towards continual learning (CL)-based universal user representation learning aiming to develop a single model capable of handling multiple tasks. Despite advancements, existing methods are in fact evaluated under an unrealistic scenario that does not consider the passage of time as tasks progress, which overlooks newly emerged items that may change the item distribution of previous tasks. In this paper, we introduce a practical evaluation scenario on which CL-based universal user representation learning approaches should be evaluated, which takes into account the passage of time as tasks progress. Then, we propose a novel framework Dynamic Time-aware continual user representation learner, named DITTO, designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting despite continuous shifts in item distribution, while also allowing the knowledge acquired from previous tasks to adapt to the current shifted item distribution. Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of DITTO over state-of-the-art methods under a practical evaluation scenario.

Summary:<br />
Tabular data is widely used but faces challenges in machine learning due to data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation offers a solution by using generative models to create realistic and privacy-preserving samples. Various methods such as energy-based models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, large language models, and diffusion models have been explored. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, covering traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models. The complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation is detailed, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation. Major challenges, real-world applications, and future research directions are identified to guide further advancements in this field. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent and critical data formats across diverse real-world applications. However, its effective use in machine learning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of real datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various generative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have investigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains or specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or privacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented insights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In particular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain underexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s evolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our survey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth comparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3) we identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open research questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly evolving area.

Summary:
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation for scattered acoustic wavefield simulation. However, traditional training using gradient descent (GD) faces issues like slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. To address this, a hybrid optimization framework has been developed that integrates a least-squares (LS) solver into the GD loss function, resulting in faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability. The new method is effective for both scenarios with or without perfectly matched layers (PML) and operates on small matrices, making it scalable for large-scale simulations. This approach outperformed standard GD-based training, showing rapid convergence even in challenging cases where traditional methods fail.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation. However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.

Abstract: Modeling the joint distribution of the data samples and their properties allows to construct a single model for both data generation and property prediction, with synergistic capabilities reaching beyond purely generative or predictive models. However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mask together with a unified pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer rivals other joint models, as well as state-of-the-art molecule generation and property prediction models. Additionally, we show the benefits of joint modeling in downstream tasks of molecular representation learning, hit identification and antimicrobial peptide design.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel generative framework that combines Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with Transformer-based hypernetworks in latent variable models. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods using MLP-based hypernetworks by employing a Transformer-based decoder for generating INR parameters from latent variables. The framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation, replacing standard decoders with Transformer-based hypernetworks for improved representation capacity and computational efficiency. The model can be trained from scratch or through hyper-transforming, fine-tuning the decoder while keeping the pre-trained latent space frozen. This allows for efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without the need for complete retraining.<br />

Abstract: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming-a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining.

<div> Regularized logistic regression, label noise, manual labeling, distributed computing, parallel algorithm
Summary:
- Penalized logistic regression (PLR) with regularization terms addresses overfitting but relies on efficient variable selection strategies.
- Label noise from manual labeling aids variable selection by providing more accurate estimation of selected coefficients.
- In large-scale settings, distributed computing is necessary for PLR with manual labeling.
- A partition-insensitive parallel algorithm based on ADMM is proposed for PLR, ensuring solutions remain consistent with distributed data storage.
- The algorithm has global convergence and sublinear convergence rate, outperforming traditional variable selection techniques in large-scale datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale supervised learning, penalized logistic regression (PLR) effectively addresses the overfitting problem by introducing regularization terms yet its performance still depends on efficient variable selection strategies. This paper theoretically demonstrates that label noise stemming from manual labeling, which is solely related to classification difficulty, represents a type of beneficial noise for variable selection in PLR. This benefit is reflected in a more accurate estimation of the selected non-zero coefficients when compared with the case where only truth labels are used. Under large-scale settings, the sample size for PLR can become very large, making it infeasible to store on a single machine. In such cases, distributed computing methods are required to handle PLR model with manual labeling. This paper presents a partition-insensitive parallel algorithm founded on the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) algorithm to address PLR by incorporating manual labeling. The partition insensitivity of the proposed algorithm refers to the fact that the solutions obtained by the algorithm will not change with the distributed storage of data. In addition, the algorithm has global convergence and a sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results indicate that, as compared with traditional variable selection classification techniques, the PLR with manually-labeled noisy data achieves higher estimation and classification accuracy across multiple large-scale datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new technique for compositional learning of synchronizing parallel systems with unknown decompositions using active automata learning. This approach refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while simultaneously learning the component models. The authors develop a theoretical framework for distributions of alphabets, characterizing counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies in global observations. By systematically updating the distribution, consistency can be restored. A compositional learning algorithm, CoalA, is presented, utilizing the LearnLib active learning library. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in membership queries, with up to five orders of magnitude enhancements, and increased scalability in systems with significant concurrency. This advancement enhances the efficacy and efficiency of automata learning in complex concurrent systems. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Active automata learning infers automaton models of systems from behavioral observations, a technique successfully applied to a wide range of domains. Compositional approaches for concurrent systems have recently emerged. We take a significant step beyond available results, including those by the authors, and develop a general technique for compositional learning of a synchronizing parallel system with an unknown decomposition. Our approach automatically refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while learning the component models. We develop a theoretical treatment of distributions of alphabets, i.e., sets of possibly overlapping component alphabets. We characterize counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies with global observations, and show how to systematically update the distribution to restore consistency. We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these ideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution counterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation, called CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our experiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders of magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in systems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in the number of equivalence queries.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with multiple human expectations and values is crucial for ensuring that they adequately serve a variety of user needs. To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as ''high-quality'' data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.

Abstract: Traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) models frequently underperform when handling data characterized by uneven categories. To address the issue, this paper proposes a Data Augmentation Partial Least Squares Regression (DAPLSR) model via manifold optimization. The DAPLSR model introduces the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to increase the number of samples and utilizes the Value Difference Metric (VDM) to select the nearest neighbor samples that closely resemble the original samples for generating synthetic samples. In solving the model, in order to obtain a more accurate numerical solution for PLSR, this paper proposes a manifold optimization method that uses the geometric properties of the constraint space to improve model degradation and optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed DAPLSR model achieves superior classification performance and outstanding evaluation metrics on various datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new self-supervised representation learning method called Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss that combines the strengths of contrastive and non-contrastive methods. By converting a contrastive method into a non-contrastive form, MINC reduces variance while maintaining mutual information formulation to prevent collapse to a constant vector. Tested on ImageNet data, MINC outperforms the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline in learning image representations. This innovative approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of self-supervised learning, providing a promising solution for leveraging unlabeled data in various downstream tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeling data is often very time consuming and expensive, leaving us with a majority of unlabeled data. Self-supervised representation learning methods such as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very successful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image data, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for downstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1) Contrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as BYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information between related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every other data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch sizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance as they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to implement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In this paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the strength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called the Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we convert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise comparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information formulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new objective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by learning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and show that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline.

Summary: 
The article introduces a federated learning paradigm for utilizing datasets from multiple providers. It discusses the challenges of data valuation in federated learning and advocates for the use of Shapley value as a metric. However, the computational overhead of Shapley value has limited its practical application. The article proposes a unified stratified-sampling framework for approximation, analyzes and selects a promising scheme for computation, and identifies key combinations of datasets that have a high impact on data value. Based on these insights, an approximation algorithm called IPSS is introduced, which strategically selects high-impact dataset combinations to reduce time cost while maintaining accuracy. Extensive evaluations on FL benchmark datasets show that IPSS outperforms existing baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning paradigm to utilize datasets across multiple data providers. In FL, cross-silo data providers often hesitate to share their high-quality dataset unless their data value can be fairly assessed. Shapley value (SV) has been advocated as the standard metric for data valuation in FL due to its desirable properties. However, the computational overhead of SV is prohibitive in practice, as it inherently requires training and evaluating an FL model across an exponential number of dataset combinations. Furthermore, existing solutions fail to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, making practical use of SV still out of reach, because they ignore choosing suitable computation scheme for approximation framework and overlook the property of utility function in FL. We first propose a unified stratified-sampling framework for two widely-used schemes. Then, we analyze and choose the more promising scheme under the FL linear regression assumption. After that, we identify a phenomenon termed key combinations, where only limited dataset combinations have a high-impact on final data value. Building on these insights, we propose a practical approximation algorithm, IPSS, which strategically selects high-impact dataset combinations rather than evaluating all possible combinations, thus substantially reducing time cost with minor approximation error. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations on the FL benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms a series of representative baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

In this paper, a wavelet-based theoretical framework is developed to analyze the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks with various activation functions. The framework utilizes wavelet frame theory on spaces of homogeneous type to derive sufficient conditions for activation functions that ensure neural networks can approximate any functions within the specified space, with an error estimate provided. These conditions accommodate smooth activation functions, including those with oscillatory behavior. By considering the $L^2$-distance between smooth and non-smooth activation functions, a generalized approximation result is established for non-smooth activations, with the error explicitly controlled by this distance. This allows for more flexibility in designing network architectures.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new framework for Bayesian estimation of differential privacy that considers evidence from multiple membership inference attacks (MIA). The proposed method, MCMC-DP-Est, utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the full posterior distribution of the privacy parameter. Unlike traditional approaches, this method does not assume the use of the most powerful attack on the worst-case dataset, providing a more realistic privacy analysis. By jointly estimating the strengths of MIAs and the privacy of the training algorithm, a more cautious evaluation of privacy is achieved. Additionally, the article presents a cost-effective method for measuring the performance of an MIA to be used in the estimation process. Numerical examples with artificial and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in estimating privacy parameters. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new framework for Bayesian estimation of differential privacy, incorporating evidence from multiple membership inference attacks (MIA). Bayesian estimation is carried out via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, named MCMC-DP-Est, which provides an estimate of the full posterior distribution of the privacy parameter (e.g., instead of just credible intervals). Critically, the proposed method does not assume that privacy auditing is performed with the most powerful attack on the worst-case (dataset, challenge point) pair, which is typically unrealistic. Instead, MCMC-DP-Est jointly estimates the strengths of MIAs used and the privacy of the training algorithm, yielding a more cautious privacy analysis. We also present an economical way to generate measurements for the performance of an MIA that is to be used by the MCMC method to estimate privacy. We present the use of the methods with numerical examples with both artificial and real data.

<div> Keywords: non-prehensile manipulation, robotics, reinforcement learning, world model, Sim2Real transfer

Summary:
PIN-WM is a novel approach for learning non-prehensile manipulation skills in robotics. By learning a world model of 3D rigid body dynamics, PIN-WM enables robust policy learning and generalization for model-based reinforcement learning. This approach utilizes differentiable physics simulation to identify the dynamical system from visual observations with only a few-shot physical interaction trajectories. PIN-WM is trained with an observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without requiring state estimation. To address the Sim2Real gap, the learned PIN-WM is transformed into a set of Digital Cousins through physics-aware randomizations that generate diverse variations. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world environments show that PIN-WM, coupled with physics-aware digital cousins, enhances the learning of non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in Real2Sim2Real scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: PIN-WM is a pioneering method that uses a world model of 3D rigid body dynamics to improve learning of non-prehensile manipulation skills in robotics through reinforcement learning. By leveraging differentiable physics simulation, observational loss, and physics-aware digital cousins, PIN-WM achieves robust policy learning and generalization with superior Sim2Real transfer capabilities. <div>

Abstract: While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.

<div> Keywords: multi-document summarization, transformer-based models, query selection, document ranking, elementary discourse units

Summary: 
Our proposed framework addresses the input length limitation in multi-document summarization by integrating query selection, document ranking, and shortening into a unified process. Instead of relying on manually crafted queries, our approach identifies salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and uses them as latent queries to guide document ranking. By filtering out irrelevant EDUs rather than truncating, we ensure that only critical information is preserved for summarization. Through evaluations on multiple datasets, our framework consistently improves ROUGE metrics and demonstrates scalability and flexibility across different model architectures. Analysis shows our framework's ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and accurately rank documents based on relevance scores. This results in an effective solution for addressing context-length constraints in multi-document summarization, establishing our framework as a robust and reliable tool.

Abstract: In the field of multi-document summarization (MDS), transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable success, yet they suffer an input length limitation. Current methods apply truncation after the retrieval process to fit the context length; however, they heavily depend on manually well-crafted queries, which are impractical to create for each document set for MDS. Additionally, these methods retrieve information at a coarse granularity, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant content. To address these issues, we propose a novel retrieval-based framework that integrates query selection and document ranking and shortening into a unified process. Our approach identifies the most salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and utilizes them as latent queries. These queries guide the document ranking by calculating relevance scores. Instead of traditional truncation, our approach filters out irrelevant EDUs to fit the context length, ensuring that only critical information is preserved for summarization. We evaluate our framework on multiple MDS datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in ROUGE metrics while confirming its scalability and flexibility across diverse model architectures. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness through an in-depth analysis, emphasizing its ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and accurately rank documents based on their relevance scores. These results demonstrate that our framework effectively addresses context-length constraints, establishing it as a robust and reliable solution for MDS.

Summary: <br />
Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a promising approach for unsupervised graph representation learning, with two main methods: augmentation-based and augmentation-free. This paper introduces a novel augmentation-free GCL framework utilizing graph neural diffusion models with Fractional Differential Equations (FDE)-based learnable encoders. By varying the order parameter of the FDE, diverse views capturing local or global information can be generated for contrastive learning. The model does not require negative samples for training and is effective for both homophilic and heterophilic datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across various datasets. <div>

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently made progress as an unsupervised graph representation learning paradigm. GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a powerful method for solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum devices. However, as the number of layers in the QAOA circuit increases, the optimization burden grows due to the linear increase in parameters. To address this issue, QAOA-PCA introduces a novel reparameterization technique utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce parameter space dimensionality. Through extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller instances, QAOA-PCA enables more efficient optimization on larger problems. Empirical evaluations on the MaxCut problem show that QAOA-PCA requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving notable efficiency gains with only a slight reduction in approximation ratio. Overall, QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead while maintaining solution quality.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices. However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly. This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed. To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.

Summary: 
Memory-based continual learning methods are crucial for adapting to novel data distributions after deployment. This work explores the impact of label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning, where new classes are added over time without access to past class data. The study focuses on the sensitivity of continual learning algorithms that utilize replay memory constructed with Coresets. A new bound for robustness to uncorrelated instance noise is derived, leading to the development of noise-tolerant replay buffer algorithms. Empirical evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that existing memory-based continual learners are not robust, while the proposed algorithms significantly improve classification accuracy and minimize forgetting in noisy class-incremental learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2504.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.

<div> Framework, Forecasting, Spatio-temporal signals, Dimensionality reduction, Ensemble

Summary: 
This study introduces an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals using dimensionality reduction and a generalized autoregressive model. The framework integrates proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection, a reservoir computer for forecasting reduced dynamics, and ensemble sequential data assimilation for online adaptation. The method is demonstrated on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, considering assimilation of full flow fields and sparse sensors. The study explores three scenarios: na\"ive physical state estimation, two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states, and three-fold estimation adjusting model parameters. The two-fold strategy enhances ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach allows robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. This work combines data-driven reduced order modeling with Bayesian data assimilation, offering new opportunities for scalable online model learning in nonlinear time series forecasting.

Abstract: We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.

<div> process reward models, verification, data-efficient, step-level supervision, test-time scaling 
Summary:
This paper introduces ThinkPRM, a data-efficient process reward model for step-by-step verification. ThinkPRM generates a verification chain-of-thought (CoT) to verify each step of a solution, requiring minimal supervision for training. The model outperforms discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge, using only 1% of the process labels needed by traditional PRMs. Performance evaluations on ProcessBench, MATH-500, AIME '24, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench show that ThinkPRM surpasses discriminative verifiers by significant margins. In an out-of-domain evaluation, ThinkPRM excels by 8% and 4.5% on subsets of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, respectively. Additionally, ThinkPRM scales verification compute more effectively than LLM-as-a-Judge, achieving a 7.2% improvement on a subset of ProcessBench under the same token budget. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of generative, long CoT PRMs for test-time verification, showcasing their ability to scale verification compute while requiring minimal training supervision. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

Summary:  
- The study explores the use of neural networks to create parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections simultaneously.  
- Parametric projections allow for embedding new data without the need to recompute the entire projection.  
- Invertible projections enable the generation of new data points.  
- Three autoencoder architectures were evaluated for their ability to create parametric and invertible projections.  
- Results suggest that autoencoders with a customized loss function can produce smoother projections compared to feed-forward neural networks, offering users control over the smoothing effect. <div>
arXiv:2504.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for embedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole, while invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However, these properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary projection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for creating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we train AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the original space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four datasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our results indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother parametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while giving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.

Abstract: This study explores alternative framework configurations for adapting thermal machine learning (ML) models for power converters by combining transfer learning (TL) and federated learning (FL) in a piecewise manner. This approach inherently addresses challenges such as varying operating conditions, data sharing limitations, and security implications. The framework starts with a base model that is incrementally adapted by multiple clients via adapting three state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques: Fine-tuning, Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), and Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA). The Flower framework is employed for FL, using Federated Averaging for aggregation. Validation with field data demonstrates that fine-tuning offers a straightforward TL approach with high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications. Benchmarking results reveal a comprehensive comparison of these methods, showcasing their respective strengths and weaknesses when applied in different scenarios. Locally hosted FL enhances performance when data aggregation is not feasible, while cloud-based FL becomes more practical with a significant increase in the number of clients, addressing scalability and connectivity challenges.

Summary: 
The study investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently capture domain-specific nuances in natural language. Through experiments, it is found that LLMs can distinguish queries from different domains based on hidden states generated during the prefill phase. The internal recognition of query domains is represented by latent domain-related trajectories within the models. The research also explores the robustness of these domain representations to variations in prompt styles and sources. The study utilizes these representations for model selection, choosing the LLM that best matches the domain trace of the input query. Surprisingly, the fine-tuned model is not always the most accurate choice. The findings indicate that LLMs can differentiate queries for related domains effectively, encompassing both closed and open-ended generative tasks. <div>

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a hybrid approach combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control. RL offers adaptability to changing conditions, while ML-MPC ensures safe and optimal controls within predefined safety limits. The hybrid system dynamically adjusts the ML-MPC load tracking reference using an RL agent to respond to environment changes, maintaining safe control inputs. Experimental results show that RL successfully adapts to dynamic conditions, improving load tracking by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) to 0.44 bar. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in addressing the challenges posed by high variance in control inputs and system drifts in engine applications. <div>
arXiv:2504.16875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input multiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for providing safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within predefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability to changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the practical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires high variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose risks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to mechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to generate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts, such as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach that uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically adjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe throughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant mismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this mismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective pressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results demonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by altering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The quantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44 bar.
